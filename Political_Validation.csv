1,1,"Kanai, R., Feilden, T., Firth, C., & Rees, G. (2011). Political orientations are correlated with brain structure in young adults. Current biology : CB, 21(8), 677‚Äì680. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2011.03.017","We speculate that the association of gray matter volume of the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex with political attitudes that we observed may reflect emotional and cognitive traits of individuals that influence their inclination to certain political orientations. For example, our findings are consistent with the proposal that political orientation is associated with psychological processes for managing fear and uncertainty [1, 10]. The amygdala has many functions, including fear processing [11]. Individuals with a large amygdala are more sensitive to fear [12], which, taken together with our findings, might suggest the testable hypothesis that individuals with larger amygdala are more inclined to integrate conservative views into their belief system. Similarly, it is striking that conservatives are more sensitive to disgust [13, 14], and the insula is involved in the feeling of disgust [15]. On the other hand, our finding of an association between anterior cingulate cortex volume and political attitudes may be linked with tolerance to uncertainty. One of the functions of the anterior cingulate cortex is to monitor uncertainty [16, 17] and conflicts [18]. Thus, it is conceivable that individuals with a larger ACC have a higher capacity to tolerate uncertainty and conflicts, allowing them to accept more liberal views. Such speculations provide a basis for theorizing about the psychological constructs (and their neural substrates) underlying political attitudes. However, it should be noted that every brain region, including those identified here, invariably participates in multiple psychological processes. It is therefore not possible to unambiguously infer from involvement of a particular brain area that a particular psychological process must be involved.

Although these conceptual links facilitate interpretations of the relationship between the brain structures and political orientation, our findings reflect a cross-sectional study of political attitudes and brain structure in a demographically relatively homogeneous population of young adults. Therefore, the causal nature of such a relationship cannot be determined. Specifically, it requires a longitudinal study to determine whether the changes in brain structure that we observed lead to changes in political behavior or whether political attitudes and behavior instead result in changes of brain structure. Our findings open the way for such research. Moreover, the voting public spans a much wider range of ages and demographics than those studied here, and indeed political representatives themselves tend to be drawn from older adult groups. It therefore remains an open question whether our findings will generalize to these other groups or whether such demographic factors may modulate the relationship that we observed. Nevertheless, our finding that gray matter volume in anterior cingulate cortex and right amygdala can explain between-participant variability in political attitudes for young adults represents a potentially important step in providing candidate mechanisms for explaining the complex relationship between genotype, environmental factors, and political phenotype. We speculate that other aspects of political behavior may similarly have an unexpected motif in human brain structure.

Our findings show that high-level concepts of political attitudes are reflected in the structure of focal regions of the human brain. Brain structure can exhibit systematic relationships with an individual‚Äôs experiences and skills [19, 20], can change after extensive training [21, 22], and is related to different aspects of conscious perception [23, 24] (see [25] for a review). We now show that such relationships with brain structure extend to complex aspects of human behavior such as political attitudes. This opens a new avenue of research to map high-level psychological features onto brain structure and to interpret sociologically motivated constructs in terms of brain functions.","Substantial differences exist in the cognitive styles of liberals and conservatives on psychological measures [1]. Variability in political attitudes reflects genetic influences and their interaction with environmental factors [2, 3]. Recent work has shown a correlation between liberalism and conflict-related activity measured by event-related potentials originating in the anterior cingulate cortex [4]. Here we show that this functional correlate of political attitudes has a counterpart in brain structure. In a large sample of young adults, we related self-reported political attitudes to gray matter volume using structural MRI. We found that greater liberalism was associated with increased gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex, whereas greater conservatism was associated with increased volume of the right amygdala. These results were replicated in an independent sample of additional participants. Our findings extend previous observations that political attitudes reflect differences in self-regulatory conflict monitoring [4] and recognition of emotional faces [5] by showing that such attitudes are reflected in human brain structure. Although our data do not determine whether these regions play a causal role in the formation of political attitudes, they converge with previous work [4, 6] to suggest a possible link between brain structure and psychological mechanisms that mediate political attitudes.","4",0,"4","Political",4,1

Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 48(11), 1548-1565. https://doi-org.wake.idm.oclc.org/10.1177/01461672211046808","In the present research, we investigated the association of cognitive abilities with economic attitudes by synthesizing the extant empirical evidence in a meta-analysis (Study 1) and by testing hypotheses concerning possible mechanisms underlying this association that follow from different theoretical perspectives (Study 2). Our meta-analysis provided evidence for a small positive association (r = .07) of cognitive abilities with economic conservatism, on average. However, the effect sizes and directions of the associations were very heterogeneous. The strength of the association was moderated by several methodological features of the extant studies: It tended to be more pronounced in studies that used measures of operational rather than symbolic economic ideology (or mixed scales), in studies that used probability samples of the population rather than self-selected samples, and in studies that used Turkish, British, or Scandinavian rather than North-American samples. However, it was not moderated through the type or number of items of the cognitive ability measure that was used.

In the light of the heterogeneity of the size and sign of the association of mental abilities with economic attitudes observed in Study 1, Study 2 aimed at investigating different hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the association. Here, we found support for a mediation of a positive effect of mental abilities on economic conservatism through income. This supports the self-interest hypothesis according to which higher cognitive abilities facilitate higher social status and high-status individuals are less supportive of governmental regulations of markets, and redistributive social policies because they have more to lose from these measures than low-status individuals (Johnston, 2018). We found no support for the economic sophistication hypothesis according to which a positive association of cognitive abilities with economic conservatism is mediated through economic knowledge. However, we found support for a negative effect of cognitive abilities on economic conservatism that is mediated through need for certainty. Importantly, the fact that we found support for two hypotheses proposing countervailing effects of mental abilities on economic political attitudes through different causal mechanism offers an explanation for the weak average association and the heterogeneity of the empirical evidence we observe in Study 1.

Some points concerning our investigation of causal mechanisms in the present research need to be highlighted: First, we used correlational data to test hypotheses about causal mechanisms. The mediation analyses we conducted allow for conclusions about whether the empirical data are compatible with and support specific hypotheses about causal mechanisms. However, these analyses cannot provide strong evidence for causal effects or detect unique causal mechanisms (see Fiedler et al., 2011). Second, the theoretical perspectives and hypotheses we described and tested are far from exhaustive. The central conclusion from the pattern of results of Study 2 is that there is evidence for multiple mechanisms with sometimes countervailing effects. However, other theoretical perspectives and mechanisms than the ones we focused on might also play a role in explaining the association of mental abilities with economic political attitudes.

Third, we derived very abstract hypotheses from the theoretical perspectives we introduced to test them empirically. The formulation and empirical test of abstract hypotheses served the purpose of the current research well. However, each of the theoretical perspectives entails more precise predictions concerning the causal mechanism that links cognitive abilities to economic political attitudes. For example, the epistemic needs hypothesis holds that individuals with high epistemic needs feel attracted to economic conservatism because core elements of economic conservatism are functional for satisfying these needs. While the fact that we find evidence for a negative link between cognitive abilities and economic conservatism that is mediated through epistemic needs supports this view, it is not clear whether a functional fit indeed explains the association of epistemic needs with economic conservatism. In this respect, it has been argued that a functional link between psychological needs and political attitudes exists primarily for sociocultural but not for economic attitudes (e.g., Federico & Malka, 2018; Johnston & Wronski, 2015; Malka & Soto, 2015). From this perspective, in contexts where social and economic conservatism are communicated as a coherent package in the political discourse, individuals with high epistemic needs who are familiar with the discourse and perceive politics as personally relevant tend to endorse economic conservatism to express their identity as conservatives rather than because economic conservatism is particularly suitable to satisfy their needs (for empirical evidence, see Jedinger & Burger, 2019, 2020; Johnston et al., 2017; Malka et al., 2014).

There is much room for future research to test different theoretical assumption on specific causal links between cognitive abilities empirically. A further promising avenue for future research on the link between cognitive abilities and political attitudes lies in focusing on specific combinations of economic and sociocultural attitudes along with corresponding symbolic self-categorizations of individuals. For example, findings by Yilmaz et al. (2020) indicate that self-identified libertarians, who combine economic conservatism with liberal sociocultural views, play a crucial role in driving the association of cognitive style with economic conservatism.

Our findings should also be considered in the light of the fact that the data of the present investigation mainly encompass samples from Western, industrialized, rich, and democratic countries while cultural and national differences may have implications for the intelligence-ideology nexus. Hence, an important avenue for future research is to extend the investigation of the link of cognitive abilities with economic policy preferences to a broader set of cultural contexts.","Evidence on the association of cognitive ability with economic attitudes is mixed. We conducted a meta-analysis (k = 20, N = 46,426) to examine the relationship between objective measures of cognitive ability and economic ideology and analyzed survey data (N = 3,375) to test theoretical explanations for the association. The meta-analysis provided evidence for a small positive association with a weighted mean effect size of r = .07 (95% CI = [0.02, 0.12]), suggesting that higher cognitive ability is associated with conservative views on economic issues, but effect sizes were extremely heterogeneous. Tests using representative survey data provided support for both a positive association of cognitive ability with economic conservatism that is mediated through income as well as for a negative association that is mediated through a higher need for certainty. Hence, multiple causal mechanisms with countervailing effects might explain the low overall association of cognitive ability with economic political attitudes.","5",0,"5","Political",4,0

Systematic empirical tests and a forecasting survey to address the controversy. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 79, 188‚Äì199. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2018.06.004","The present investigation provides the first systematic empirical evidence that political values can affect the end products of the scientific process ‚Äî the research reports themselves. In scientific abstracts from social psychology, conservatives and conservative ideas are described significantly more negatively than liberals and liberal ideas. At the same time, conservatives are more likely to be treated as a target of explanation than are liberals. In a forecasting survey, scientists accurately anticipated the direction and general magnitude of both effects, but significantly overestimated both, predicting that evaluative and explanatory differences in the research reports would be somewhat greater than they actually were. A comparison of their stated beliefs both before and after knowing the results of the empirical investigation indicates that scientists revised their views regarding the extent to which politics shapes science in light of the evidence.

Although moderate in size statistically by conventional standards (Cohen, 1988; Sawilowsky, 2009), it is important not to understate the implications of the evaluative and explanatory differences in the scientific research reports. The obtained effect sizes are comparable to those typically found in research on psychology (Richard et al., 2003). In terms of the consequential validity of our findings (Messick, 1995; Rosenthal, 1990), it is useful to place them in the context of effect sizes associated with discrimination against women and underrepresented racial minorities, which can have societally important effects even when modest in size statistically (Greenwald, Banaji, & Nosek, 2015), especially when bias accumulates across many decisions over time (Martell, Lane, & Emrich, 1996). The same point applies to biases against conservatives and conservative ideas within academia (Inbar & Lammers, 2012). Therefore, the present research suggests that collectively and individually, scientists should be aware of and seek to consciously correct for the tendency to focus on conservatives as a target of explanation and explain them in negative terms. An analogy can again be drawn to the literature on intergroup prejudice, which identifies awareness and motivation as the keys to breaking the link between psychological biases and discriminatory actions (Devine, Monteith, Zuwerink, & Elliot, 1991; Monteith, Lybarger, & Woodcock, 2009). At the same time, in considering the practical significance of the findings, researchers should keep in mind that these are overall estimates which may not generalize across all research contexts and topics.

Notably, several other predictions regarding politics and science failed to find evidentiary support. Our hypothesis that politically conservative raters would perceive a liberal bias in scientific abstracts not seen by liberal raters, was not born out by the data. Similarly, the political values of scientists failed to moderate their forecasts about the politics of research abstracts. Finally, in a supplementary study tracking publication outcomes, we found no evidence that conference abstracts that evaluated conservatives negatively relative to liberals, and treated conservatives as more in need of explanation than liberals, were any more likely to eventually appear in prestigious academic journals (Supplement 6).

3.1. Limitations and future directions
The present results represent initial empirical evidence of a political overtone to scientific research reports in social psychology, but are also open to interpretation. As noted earlier, evaluative differences in scientific reports could reflect liberal bias, or conservatism being objectively correlated with characteristics widely regarded as undesirable, such as racism and close-mindedness (the ‚Äúreality has a liberal bias‚Äù hypothesis). Explanatory differences, too, might have more benign instigators than viewing conservatives as abnormal and in need of explanation. 

Although we provide tests of one potential dimension of political bias ‚Äî how liberals and conservatives are portrayed in research ‚Äî this is merely one among many aspects of politicized research (Brandt & Proulx, 2015; Brandt & Sp√§lti, 2018; Jussim et al., 2016). Future metascientific investigations should code research topics at a more granular level to examine what is studied and how research questions are framed, characterizations of competition and incentives, and conclusions about intergroup bias, human rationality, and other topics.

Diverse methodological approaches should be employed to capture the various ways in which political values might intrude into scientific research. For instance, semantic analyses of large databases of scientific articles could be used to assess the valence of the words that appear near to ‚Äúconservative‚Äù and ‚Äúliberal‚Äù (Holtzman, Schott, Jones, Balota, & Yarkoni, 2011). Databases of academic citations (Uzzi, Mukherjee, Stringer, & Jones, 2013) could be leveraged to examine whether politically unpopular ideas and scholars who espouse them are excluded from the intellectual network over time. 

Given anecdotal cases of refuted science that continues to be cited (Collins, 2014; Jussim, 2015) and evidence that laypeople set different evidentiary thresholds for desired and undesired conclusions (Ditto & Lopez, 1992), future work should systematically examine citation rates over time for published studies whose findings are politically favorable to liberal or conservative ideology, and which are subsequently refuted or not. Disproven research whose conclusions favor liberal policies may enjoy a higher citation rate than invalidated work supporting conservative policies. The political implications of the finding may also affect willingness to accept the null hypothesis (Greenwald, 1975). In other words, null effects, typically difficult to publish and poorly cited, may be welcomed by the academic community when highly congenial to liberal sensibilities. For instance, an article showing a lack of gender differences on a specific dimension may be more cited (and less easily refuted) than an article reporting a lack of gender discrimination in a particular context.

Data analytic choices represent a potential entry point for the influence of political values on research. As there are typically multiple defensible ways to analyze the same dataset (Bakker, van Dijk, & Wicherts, 2012; Gelman & Loken, 2014; Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn, 2011), scientists may (perhaps unconsciously) choose an approach that leads to a politically appealing conclusion. If so, there should be a greater degree of publication bias, as reflected in a p-curve or p-uniform analysis (Simonsohn, Nelson, & Simmons, 2014; van Aert, Wicherts, & van Assen, 2016), evident in quantitative articles reporting conclusions favorable to liberalism. Research on politicized topics may also be more likely to use covariates to achieve significance (Lenz & Sahn, 2017), and scientists' political orientation may moderate their effect size estimates on politicized topics when many analysts use the same dataset to test the same hypothesis (Silberzahn et al., in press).

Our forecasting survey had some significant limitations that should be factored into the design of future studies. The use of social media to recruit participants online for a survey on ‚Äúpolitics in science‚Äù may have oversampled individuals who perceive academic research as politically biased. Future forecasting surveys should employ representative sampling to more accurately gauge scientific opinion both before and after key empirical investigations are conducted. Completion rates were also lower than hoped, with 65% of individuals who started the forecasting survey finishing it and 35% discontinuing. This could have been due to the challenging nature of the effect size estimation task, lack of clarity in the instructions, and/or the unexpected length of the survey. In addition, the belief updating observed could have been partly due to experimental demand, although the anonymous reporting conditions would arguably mitigate this problem to some extent. That some beliefs about politics in science (i.e., beliefs about the extent of bias) shifted in light of the evidence while others (i.e., beliefs about the underlying causes of bias) did not suggest that the belief updating that did occur was genuine. However, future work is needed to determine the degree to which belief change among scientists in light of new empirical evidence is genuine and durable. Future forecasting studies should also examine scientists' beliefs about the numerous potential aspects of politicized science described above.

3.2. Conclusion
The extent to which investigations of politically charged topics are affected by the generally liberal values of the scientists who carry out the research has been a topic of considerable debate inside and outside academia for some time. The present research informs this discussion by providing the first empirical evidence of systematic effects of political values on research reports in a scientific field. At the same time, a great deal of further meta-scientific work is needed to uncover when politics does (and does not) play a role in the scientific process, and what might potentially be done about it.

Scientific debates often prove intractable, even in the face of accumulating empirical evidence (Kahneman & Klein, 2009; Kuhn, 1962; Mellers, Hertwig, & Kahneman, 2001). We hope that our forecasting survey serves not only as a means of addressing the longstanding public debate over alleged liberal bias in academic research, but also as a model for future scientific exchanges more generally (Tetlock et al., 2014). A similar approach might be profitably applied to other prominent controversies, such as the extent to which measures of implicit associations predict relevant outcomes (Greenwald et al., 2015; Greenwald, Poehlman, Uhlmann, & Banaji, 2009; Oswald, Mitchell, Blanton, Jaccard, & Tetlock, 2015), whether unconsciously activated concepts exert a robust and reliable influence over human behavior (Bargh, 2012; Harris, Coburn, Rohrer, & Pashler, 2013), and other present and future questions that capture the attention of scientists.","The present investigation provides the first systematic empirical tests for the role of politics in academic research. In a large sample of scientific abstracts from the field of social psychology, we find both evaluative differences, such that conservatives are described more negatively than liberals, and explanatory differences, such that conservatism is more likely to be the focus of explanation than liberalism. In light of the ongoing debate about politicized science, a forecasting survey permitted scientists to state a priori empirical predictions about the results, and then change their beliefs in light of the evidence. Participating scientists accurately predicted the direction of both the evaluative and explanatory differences, but at the same time significantly overestimated both effect sizes. Scientists also updated their broader beliefs about political bias in response to the empirical results, providing a model for addressing divisive scientific controversies across fields.","6",0,"6","Political",4,1

Science, 365(6456), eaat7693. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aat7693","We identified genome-wide significant loci associated with same-sex sexual behavior and found evidence of a broader contribution of common genetic variation. We established that the underlying genetic architecture is highly complex; there is certainly no single genetic determinant (sometimes referred to as the ‚Äúgay gene‚Äù in the media). Rather, many loci with individually small effects, spread across the whole genome and partly overlapping in females and males, additively contribute to individual differences in predisposition to samesex sexual behavior. All measured common variants together explain only part of the genetic heritability at the population level and do not allow meaningful prediction of an individual‚Äôs sexual preference. 

The knowledge that the variants involved are numerous and spread across the genome enabled us to leverage whole-genome analytic techniques to explore human sexual behavior in ways previously impossible. We determined that the genetic effects that differentiate heterosexual from same-sex sexual behavior are not the same as those that differ among nonheterosexuals with lower versus higher proportions of same-sex partners. This finding suggests that on the genetic level, there is no single dimension from opposite-sex to same-sex preference. The existence of such a dimension, in which the more someone is attracted to the same-sex the less they are attracted to the opposite-sex, is the premise of the Kinsey scale (39), a research tool ubiquitously used to measure sexual orientation. Another measure, the Klein Grid (40), retains the same premise but separately measures sexual attraction, behavior, fantasies, and identification (as well as nonsexual preferences); however, we found that these sexual measures are influenced by similar genetic factors. Overall, our findings suggest that the most popular measures are based on a misconception of the underlying structure of sexual orientation and may need to be rethought. In particular, using separate measures of attraction to the opposite sex and attraction to the same sex, such as in the Sell Assessment of Sexual Orientation (41), would remove the assumption that these variables are perfectly inversely related and would enable more nuanced exploration of the full diversity of sexual orientation, including bisexuality and asexuality.

Although we emphasize the polygenicity of the genetic effects on same-sex sexual behavior, we identified five SNPs whose association with same-sex sexual behavior reached genomewide significance. Three of these replicated in other independent samples whose measures related to identity and attraction rather than behavior. These SNPs may serve to generate new lines of enquiry. In particular, the finding that one of the replicated SNPs (rs28371400‚Äì15q21.3) is linked to male pattern balding and is nearby a gene (TCF12) relevant to sexual differentiation strengthens the idea that sex-hormone regulation may be involved in the development of same-sex sexual behavior. Also, that another replicated SNP (rs34730029‚Äì11q12.1) is strongly linked to several genes involved in olfaction raises intriguing questions. Although the underlying mechanism at this locus is unclear, a link between olfaction and reproductive function has previously been established. Individuals with Kallmann syndrome exhibit both delayed or absent pubertal development and an impaired sense of smell because of the close developmental origin of fetal gonadotropinreleasing hormone and olfactory neurons (42).

Our study focused on the genetic basis of same-sex sexual behavior, but several of our results point to the importance of sociocultural context as well. We observed changes in prevalence of reported same-sex sexual behavior across time, raising questions about how genetic and sociocultural influences on sexual behavior might interact. We also observed partly different genetic influences on same-sex sexual behavior in females and males; this could reflect sex differences in hormonal influences on sexual behavior (for example, importance of testosterone versus estrogen) but could also relate to different sociocultural contexts of female and male same-sex behavior and different demographics of gay, lesbian, and bisexual groups (43). With these points in mind, we acknowledge the limitation that we only studied participants of European ancestry and from a few Western countries; research involving larger and more diverse samples will afford greater insight into how these findings fare across different sociocultural contexts.

Our findings provide insights into the biological underpinnings of same-sex sexual behavior but also underscore the importance of resisting simplistic conclusions (Box 2)‚Äîbecause the behavioral phenotypes are complex, because our genetic insights are rudimentary, and because there is a long history of misusing genetic results for social purposes.","Twin and family studies have shown that same-sex sexual behavior is partly genetically influenced, but previous searches for specific genes involved have been underpowered. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 477,522 individuals, revealing five loci significantly associated with same-sex sexual behavior. In aggregate, all tested genetic variants accounted for 8 to 25% of variation in same sex sexual behavior, only partially overlapped between males and females, and do not allow meaningful prediction of an individual‚Äôs sexual behavior. Comparing these GWAS results with those for the proportion of same-sex to total number of sexual partners among nonheterosexuals suggests that there is no single continuum from opposite-sex to same-sex sexual behavior. Overall, our findings provide insights into the genetics underlying same-sex sexual behavior and underscore the complexity of sexuality._x000D_","1",0,"1","Apolitical",4,0

Differences Between Lifelong Singles and Ever-Partnered Individuals in Big Five Personality Traits and Life Satisfaction. Psychological Science, 35(12), 1364-1381. https://doi-org.wake.idm.oclc.org/10.1177/09567976241286865","We investigated personality-trait differences between lifelong singles and ever-partnered individuals in middle and older adulthood. Specification-curve analyses indicated that lifelong singles are lower in extraversion, conscientiousness, and life satisfaction. Effects were strongest when defining lifelong singles as neverpartnered individuals, and they were weakest (but still evident) in never-married individuals. Results for openness depended on lifelong singlehood definitions. Exploratory analyses suggested that never-married individuals (with other lifelong singles excluded) were less agreeable than ever-married individuals, but results for agreeableness were mostly null. Country-level singlehood and gender ratios, as well as individuals‚Äô age and gender, were considerable factors moderating the size of group differences in neuroticism and life satisfaction. Higher income was associated with smaller differences in conscientiousness between groups.

Our findings are in line with previous studies investigating current or younger lifelong singles (e.g., Luhmann et al., 2012; Neyer & Lehnart, 2007). Group differences could be explained by selection effects; people higher in extraversion, conscientiousness, and life satisfaction are more likely to enter a relationship (B√ºhler et al., 2024; Chopik et al., 2023; Wagner et al., 2015) ‚Äîdifferences that may endure across the life span. There might also be socialization effects; group differences could be driven by personality change through relationship transitions. However, these socialization effects have been found to be rather rare, short-term, and dependent on individual relationship quality (B√ºhler et al., 2023, 2024; Lucas & Clark, 2006; Lucas et al., 2003). We found within-group differences between singles, because never-partnered individuals were lower in openness compared with ever-partnered individuals, but there were no differences for never-cohabitating or nevermarried individuals. These results show that the definition of singlehood matters, and differences in that definition could explain mixed findings in previous studies. People higher in openness are more likely to enter a relationship (B√ºhler et al., 2024), and they might be more open to less normative relationship forms, such as living apart together.

We did not find simple group differences between lifelong singles and ever-partnered individuals in neuroticism, as reported by studies focusing on current or younger lifelong singles (Hoan & MacDonald, 2024; Neyer & Lehnart, 2007). Sample characteristics might explain these discrepancies. Lifelong singles were more neurotic compared with ever-partnered individuals when they were younger, male, and in countries with higher proportions of singles or men. These effects might be explained by the normativity of being in a relationship that likely differs across the investigated variables (B√ºhler et al., 2024; Neyer et al., 2014), which future research should investigate. Our finding of no group differences in agreeableness is consistent with previous findings that agreeableness does not play a role in relationship formation and is not affected by relationship life events (B√ºhler et al., 2024). Nevertheless, the finding from distinct group analyses that never-married individuals (with never-cohabitating and never-partnered people excluded), are less agreeable is in contrast to previous research reporting that lower agreeableness predicts marriage (Asselmann & Specht, 2020).

Implications and directions for future research

Our findings indicate mean-level differences in life satisfaction and some Big Five traits between lifelong singles and ever-partnered individuals. Our study contributes to a foundation for future research on wellbeing and personality sequelae of lifelong singlehood. Future research should adopt a within-group perspective to understand individual differences among lifelong singles and their unique experiences (Girme et al., 2023; Park et  al., 2023). Longitudinal studies would enable investigation of the codevelopment of personality and well-being in lifelong singles, because personality explains substantial variance in well-being (Steel et al., 2008). Further, investigations of our results for younger cohorts are needed. More recent cohorts likely differ from older cohorts in norms and acceptance of singlehood, given that the importance of marriage for well-being is declining, that more people choose to stay single, and that younger cohorts report lower importance of partnership for happiness (Bellani et al., 2017; Scheling & Richter, 2021). This potential change in cultural norms may affect the relationship between lifelong singlehood and individual differences, especially in life satisfaction. 

Our findings suggest that lifelong singlehood definitions, as well as societal factors across countries, contribute to group differences. Differences between singles and ever-partnered individuals were largest in never-partnered individuals. Further, the effect of singles self-reporting lower life satisfaction was less robust for never-married and never-cohabitating singles (with never-partnered singles excluded). Thus, lower life satisfaction in (lifelong) singles might not be predominantly driven by separated people (as argued by DePaulo & Morris, 2005; Johnson & Wu, 2002). Experiencing the dynamics of past partnership could affect personality and life satisfaction (Lehnart et al., 2010; Wagner et  al., 2015). Still, not having experienced cohabitation or marriage (but having experienced a committed relationship) seems to also make a difference for life satisfaction in many singles. Future research should investigate the lasting effects of previous relationships or singlehood length.

Country-level religiosity did not show moderating effects, and the other country-level variables were only important for some traits (e.g., neuroticism), suggesting that lifelong singlehood might be a similar experience across most European countries. Nevertheless, effects could be different for countries with even stronger norms of cohabitation and marriage. Finally, as people age, they are more likely to face health issues, and social support becomes increasingly important. In never-partnered individuals, this support cannot stem from partners, but singles might be more connected to friends (Sarkisian & Gerstel, 2016). It is crucial to investigate whether this is evident for older, lifelong singles, or whether this growing group of individuals needs specific interventions. Future research should also examine how parenthood shapes singlehood.

Limitations
Limitations include the cross-sectional design, which constrains investigations of dynamics; it also makes it harder to disentangle selection from socialization effects, as well as age from cohort effects (B√ºhler & Nikitin, 2020). Further, we relied on specific assessments available in the panel study, including a short measure of the Big Five that did not include finergrained personality facets (Hoan & MacDonald, 2024). Such short-form measures of broad trait domains cannot assess the constructs‚Äô breadth, resulting in underrepresentation of some trait components (Cred√© et al., 2012). A combination of self- and other reports might have provided more accurate estimates of people‚Äôs traits. Further, well-being domains more structurally tied to relationship status (e.g., sexual satisfaction) appear more strongly related to singlehood versus partnership (Hoan & MacDonald, 2024). Please also note that the generalizability of our findings is potentially limited to people over 50 years of age from European countries. Finally, exact causal pathways and mechanisms‚Äîsuch as reasons for lower life satisfaction in lifelong singles and resulting possibilities for interventions‚Äîremain unclear.

Conclusion
In a large-scale panel study spanning 27 countries, we found robust evidence that lifelong singles in middle to older adulthood are less extraverted, conscientious, and satisfied with their lives compared with everpartnered individuals. Never-partnered individuals, but not never-cohabitating or never-married individuals, self-reported lower openness. Country-level and individual-level variables moderated differences in neuroticism. Our study is one step to understanding characteristics and needs of the growing group of lifelong singles, and it opens up new research questions. Future studies should capture a within-group perspective while developing knowledge about lifelong singles‚Äô social-support networks.","Being romantically partnered is widely seen as a societal norm, and it has been shown to be positively associated with important life outcomes, such as physical and mental health. However, the percentage of singles is steadily increasing, with more people staying single for life. We used the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE; N = 77,064, mainly ‚â• 50 years, 27 countries) to investigate Big Five personality traits and life satisfaction in lifelong singles compared with ever-partnered individuals. Specification-curve analyses suggested that lifelong singles were less extraverted, less conscientious, less open to experiences (dependent on singlehood definition), and less satisfied with their lives. Effects were stronger for never-partnered than for never-cohabitating or never-married individuals and were partly moderated by gender, age, country-level singlehood, and gender ratio. Our study provides insights into the characteristics of lifelong singles and has implications for understanding mental health and structures of social support in older individuals.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Political",4,0

A review and empirical comparison of motivation scoring methods: An application to self-determination theory. Motivation and Emotion, 44, 534-548.","This study reviewed and compared diferent scoring methods of motivational constructs proposed by SDT to determine which has greater statistical soundness including parsimony, and predictive validity. Beginning with model ft, B-ESEM ft the data best, followed by ESEM, CFA, and then higherorder models. Although more complex models such as B-ESEM and ESEM are expected to display greater model ft due to the increased parameterization, it is interesting to note that CFA out-performed higher-order models. Notably, the RAI is not a model-based estimation procedure and therefore cannot be compared to the other methods based on ft indices. Indicators of parsimony favored ESEM and B-ESEM measurement models, though more broadly, the amount of information captured by a model was approximately proportional to its complexity. This suggests that while simplifed models do exclude construct-relevant information, it is not beyond expectation. Finally, examination of variance in outcomes showed a clear division with multidimensional scoring methods (CFA, ESEM, and B-ESEM) capable of predicting approximately 30‚Äì40% more variance than more simplifed methods (i.e. higher-order models and RAI). In all, these results show that multidimensional scoring methods more accurately and fully represent motivation within SDT and should be preferred over simplifed models when theoretically relevant.

It is also worth noting that several instance of lost information can be seen when examining regression resultsclosely (Tables S3‚ÄìS14). Sample 2 demonstrates the potential positive influence of introjection with resulting indicating a positive efect of this motivation type on workplace adaptivity, proactivity, and intention to stay at the organization. Categorizing introjected regulation as a ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù form of motivation and weighting it negatively in the RAI calculation excluded these efects. We also show several instances in which identifed regulation appears a more important predictor than intrinsic motivation. For example, both Samples 3 and 6 indicate that the predictive capability of identifed regulation when predicting GPA and life satisfaction (Tables S8 and S14). Additionally, as demonstrated in Sample 3, external regulation may play an increasingly negative infuence when predicting GPA over the three measured timepoints, whereas intrinsic motivation appeared to become an increasingly less important predictor (Table S8). Each of these examples are theoretically consistent representations of information captured through multidimensional methods that is excluded by more simplifed methods.

Comparing CFA, ESEM and B-ESEM, it should be noted that ESEM has demonstrated the ability to reduce artifcially infated inter-factor correlations compared to CFA (Asparouhov and Muthen 2009; Guay et al. 2015), which directly reduces the degree of multicollinearity. ESEM thus results in more accurate partitioning of explained variance between predictors, which overcomes one of the main criticisms of traditional CFA approaches. B-ESEM fares even better in this respect as all factors in this model are uncorrelated (with commonalities absorbed into the G-factor), eliminating multicollinearity entirely. While this partitioning of variance into orthogonal units is a strength in reducing multicollinearity, it also has important implications for the interpretation of regulation factors. Specifcally, B-ESEM involve a diferent interpretation of motivation as it separates what is common across the motivational regulations into a general factor that has been interpreted as representing the degree of self-determination (as judged by the predictable pattern of factor loadings, Howard et al. 2018; Litalien et al. 2017) from the unique motivational characteristics that diferentiate the regulations. While in CFA and ESEM solutions, the intrinsic motivation factor, for example, represents both a high level of self-determined motivation as well as a regulation-specifc element (e.g. enjoyment), in B-ESEM, these characteristics are separated into a component representing the degree of self-determined (modeled by the G-factor) and a component purely representing ‚Äújoy‚Äù or ‚Äúinterest‚Äù (modeled in the S-factor).

A clear example of note relating to this method of partitioning variance is seen in the regression results of Sample 5 (Table S12). While the ESEM methodology indicates no signifcant relationship between external regulation and any outcomes, the B-ESEM solution ofers a more nuanced perspective in which external regulation signifcantly predicts need frustration, while the general factor of self-determination has a counteracting negative infuence. This clearly highlights that while self-determination reduces need frustration, external incentives increase it. When external regulation is defned as a combination of self determination and external contingencies, as it is in CFA and ESEM solutions, these efects are entirely obscured. We argue that this partitioning deserves further theoretical and empirical consideration in SDT research to verify initial results (Howard et al. 2018; Litalien et al. 2017), particularly in respect to distinguishing and interpreting the contribution of self-determined motivation versus other qualities of the regulations (e.g., self-esteem contingencies, meaningfulness, enjoyment) in predicting outcomes, and what antecedents are likely to afect each of them. However, both ESEM and B-ESEM solutions have the tendency to fail to converge in smaller data sets. This is noticed in two of the current samples and indicates that these methods will not be a viable option for all studies. Therefore, researchers may need to plan for larger sample sizes to use these methods or, alternatively, opt for CFA when necessary.

As such, it appears that simplifed methods such as the RAI and higher-order models are useful for examining specifc hypotheses regarding only the degree of self-determination, they will not capture regulation specifc efects. While CFA is a somewhat suitable solution, ESEM demonstrates some notable advantages and is therefore preferable to CFA when possible. B-ESEM is a statistically strong and theoretically consistent approach to modeling motivation which demonstrates further advantages over either ESEM or CFA, yet further validation work is strongly encourage to more clearly defne the nature and roles of the resulting factors.

Implications for theory, research and practice
First regarding theory, while each scoring method is supported in some way by SDT, application of these methods has notably diferent theoretical implications. For example, applying the RAI tells the researcher if greater (or lesser) levels of self-determination are signifcantly associated with a covariate. However, it does not consider the regulation factors themselves, excluding for example, the possibility to test whether identifed regulation (with its focus on meaningfulness) or introjection (with its focus on ego involvement) plays a role. Higher-order models sufer from this same issue. Multidimensional operationalizations, in contrast, contribute theoretical knowledge not available in simplifed scoring methods. Specifcally, they take into account the particularities of each regulation, which is important as these have shown to be signifcant in predicting outcomes in the health, education, and work domains (Burton et al. 2006; Gagn√© et al. 2015; Ng et al. 2012). B-ESEM is particularly noteworthy in this regard as it separates what is common versus specifc across the motivational regulations, and therefore may be the most theoretically consistent approach to modeling motivation. These more complex multidimensional scoring methods will be necessary for the future theoretical development of SDT. These issues are theoretically important because selection of a scoring method will dictate the necessary interpretation of results. As each scoring method conceptualizes diferent components of motivation, researchers must be aware of these implications, and utilize scoring method appropriately to align with research questions in order to be efective.

For empirical research and practice, our results indicate that multidimensional scoring methods should be favored when possible in terms of conforming to theoretical tenets of SDT, statistical soundness, and variance explained in outcomes. Applying these more complex methods may mean dealing with more motivation variables than would be required by simplifed methods and, in the case of CFA, additionally dealing with the multicollinearity that comes along with this. One method which largely resolves these issues is relative weights analysis (RWA), which is most easily conducted through a web-based interface which produces syntax based upon imputed information (Tonidandel and LeBreton 2015). This method was designed to remove multicollinearity from correlated predictors and estimate the proportion of explained variance each individual predictor is capable of accounting for (Tonidandel and LeBreton 2011, 2015). As such, using RWA, in conjunction with CFA-derived motivation factors, will clearly identify which regulation types are infuencing an outcome (and which are not) and indicate the relative contribution of each. Using a multidimensional approach accompanied by RWA may provide a relatively simple and yet highly efective way forward for many areas of motivation research. For example, among organizational scholars there has been ongoing disagreement concerning the role of external regulation and its ability to predict performance, with some arguing for a positive relationship (Gerhart and Fang 2014, 2015) and others arguing for a null or even negative infuence (Gagn√© and Forest 2008). While an undoubtedly complex topic of study, the role of multicollinearity in shrouding these results remains unclear. The procedures recommended here, specifcally, ESEM, CFA accompanied by RWA, or bifactor models will help in solving these issues. While complex, the advantages of not only increasing predictive capability but also modelling motivation more comprehensively (thereby capturing regulation specifc efects) is something to aspire to as SDT continues to develop.

In addition to being theoretically meaningful, understanding the contribution of each of the motivation types can have practical implications in the design of interventions, and may help practitioners decide whether they should, for example, direct their eforts towards making activities more interesting and enjoyable (i.e. intrinsically motivating), more meaningful (identifed regulation), or whether externally administered rewards (external regulation) are necessary in order to obtain desired outcomes such as continued efort and performance (Gagn√© et al. 2015; Ng et al. 2012).

Limitations and future directions
We frst acknowledge that the development and application of scoring methods is more complex than well-ftting models and increased amounts of explainable variance. Accordingly, we cannot give a universal recommendation as the scoring method selected will depend on theoretical alignment between method and the hypotheses to be tested. However, we highlight meaningful theoretical implications and show empirical diferences between various scoring methods and recommend future research account for these issues. Further practical considerations are also worth noting, for example, the expected sample size and potential restrictions on number of items measured (e.g. experience sampling methodologies and experimental research). While such considerations may result in the use of composite measures of motivation, it must however be acknowledged that such tests are incomplete representations of SDT (Howard et al. 2018; Litalien et al. 2017) and therefore carry demonstrable limitations.

A further possible limitation of the current study is the use of factor scores in the predictive models rather than fully latent models. The decision to use factor scores has moved the results one step away from typical research but has controlled for divergences between methods being either modelbased (i.e. SEM) or not (e.g., RAI), and thereby standardized one element of operationalization to enable more direct comparisons. While this ideally suited the current research questions, it is acknowledged that research using fully latent models could obtain slightly diferent results, likely favoring model-based methods that account for measurement error more fully.

Future study designs could also seek to more clearly distinguish ESEM and B-ESEM solutions and ofer more concrete examples of when one method would be considered ideal over the other. While recent evidence is mounting to support the B-ESEM solution (Howard et al. 2018; Litalien et al. 2017), several issues remain to be resolved including the potential meaning of a general factors shifting depending on included subscales, and greater understanding of factors which predict each element within bifactor models. Future research designed to validate this factor structure is recommended. Finally, the current examination of diferent scoring methods was limited to SDT. We would encourage future research to examine multidimensional constructs within other theoretical frameworks and the implications of using subscales compared to more parsimonious methods. Our expectations are that such endeavors would come to the same list of advantages and disadvantages which would lead to similar recommendations. However, future research is needed to test the generalizability of our results.

Conclusion
Through testing and comparing multiple computational methods for motivational scales derived from SDT, it is demonstrated that multidimensional scoring methods more accurately and comprehensively represent motivation as evidenced by the greater variance explained in outcomes. While we acknowledge that simplifed scoring methods will be suitable in some research contexts examining only the degree of self-determination, it is important to consider the implications of such practices and interpret results accordingly. It is recommended that multidimensional methods (in combination with relative weights analysis when necessary) be used when possible in order to maximize the accuracy and predictive power of SDT‚Äôs motivational conceptualization, and to capture important regulation-specifc efects.","Self-determination Theory differentiates various types of motivation, each of which have different consequences for well being and behavior. Despite broad agreement concerning the nature of different types of motivation, numerous scoring methods, each of which rely on different assumptions, are commonly practiced. These practices range from a relative autonomy index that collapses all types of motivation into a single index, higher-order models grouping subscales into a two-factor solution, to multi-factorial approaches examining all motivation types as separate constructs. Existing evidence has not empirically compared these methods or clearly favored the use of one over another. We review each method and further investigate the advantages and disadvantages of each approach by directly comparing a range of commonly utilized scoring methods, as well as recently developed methods across six independent samples from various life domains to determine their effectiveness. Results generally favor multidimensional methods (e.g., exploratory structural equation modeling, B-ESEM, and CFA) as more comprehensive scoring practices as they maximize construct relevant information. However, selection of an ideal method will rely on theoretical congruence between methodology and research questions.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,1

The Journal of Social Psychology, 162(3), 386-392.","There is considerable evidence showing that people at diferent ends of the ideological spectrum and with diferent overlapping social characteristics are more afectively polarized. In this paper, we asked whether the afectively polarized on diferent sides of the partisan divide may also have something in common: their personality. We show that to some extent this is the case. People high in narcissism are more afectively polarized. The more narcissistic the person, the greater their ingroup attachment, out group animosity and out-group prejudice. This suggests that there are certain similarities between people who are afectively polarized.

Our fndings also highlight the importance of separating out the two elements of afective polarization when looking at possible causes. Narcissism appears somewhat more important for out-group animosity than in-group afnity. There is no efect of narcissism on positive perceptions of one‚Äôs own in-group, just on negative perceptions of the out-group. Afective polarization is generated by liking the ingroup and disliking the out-group, but that does not mean that causes of afective polarization afect each aspect equally. Equally important is breaking down narcissism into its two aspects. We see that admiration, with its emphasis on self-importance and superiority, is, at most, weakly associated with a positive in-group identity. On the other hand, rivalry, with its emphasis on entitlement, and thus antagonistic self-defense, plays a role in both positive in-group identities and negative out-group identities.

One obvious implication that future research could further investigate is how different political contexts may matter for these relationships. For example, in a preliminary experimental test (see Online Appendix 11 for the full details and results), we find that an experimentally manipulated context has diferent efects on the impact of rivalry and admiration on afective polarization. To change this context, we asked subjects to list either positive words about their own party or negative words about the other party. In a context in which people were more focused on being cheerleaders for their own side, rather than critics of the other side, we see greater efects of admiration on in-group afnity. Self-promotion appears to spill-over into group admiration. The reverse also appears true: in situations in which people are more focused on the negative aspects of the out-group, it is rivalry, not admiration, which predicts in-group afnity. These results suggest that getting to grips with the nuances of how context interacts with personality to produce afective polarization is potentially an important next step for afective polarization researchers.

Leaving aside context, however, if we assume that narcissism is generally related to afective polarization, then these intrinsic personality similarities among the afectively polarized also have broader implications for how we understand both mass and elite afective polarization. At the mass level, there has been widespread debate about whether narcissism is increasing via generational replacement with newer cohorts argued to be more narcissistic due to changing child rearing methods and an increased emphasis on ‚Äòself-esteem‚Äô (see Twenge & Foster, 2010; Twenge et  al., 2008; Westerman et  al., 2012; but against this, see Donnellan et  al., 2009; Trzesniewski et al., 2008). While the evidence for this trend remains far from conclusive, it is possible that any increases in narcissism over time could be contributing to increasing rates of mass afective polarization. At the elite level, our fndings could also provide part of the explanation for why elites are typically more afectively polarized than the public. Competing for electoral ofce is attractive to certain types of people: those high in extraversion (Dynes et al., 2019), low in empathy (Cliford et al., 2021) and, crucially, high in narcissism (Blais & Pruysers, 2017; Hart et al., 2022; Peterson & Palmer, 2022; Watts et al., 2013). This greater narcissism makes political elites, even aside from their greater ideological polarization, potentially more intrinsically prone to afective polarization. It is also worth considering a wider notion of elite opinion formers beyond simply politicians. The views of journalists, business leaders and actors tend to be given greater precedence in public discourse, not least in the age of social media, yet these are precisely the professions which tend to attract people who are more narcissistic (Kowalski et al., 2017; Rothman & Lichter, 1985) and who are thus, on average, more likely to be afectively polarized. If political elites, or this wider elite, do cue voters then mass afective polarization is being partially generated by the fact that narcissists are more likely to enter these elite professions. Our fndings thus help us further understand the phenomenon of afective polarization from both above and below.

Nonetheless, there are, as always, caveats to our fndings. Perhaps most importantly, and as discussed earlier, our fndings can only show a correlation, not a causal relationship. While most personality research assumes that personality traits are fixed from early childhood and are thus causes of any political attitudes and behavior, it is increasingly clear that any relationship between political views and personality may be reciprocal. For example, using panel and experimental data, Bakker et al. (2021) show that there is a weak efect of political attitudes on the Big Five personality traits. Similarly Boston et al. (2018) fnd that the Big Five, especially openness to experience, are predicted by political variables such as presidential approval. These important fndings should make us cautious about not over interpreting our results in a strictly causal manner.

Indeed, there is an argument that strong group identifcation could produce narcissism. Certainly there is evidence that children who are told they are superior become more narcissistic and there is an analogy there with being in a (political) group which tells each other they are superior (Brummelman et al., 2015). Nonetheless, this evidence for change is from early years‚Äô socialization, not adult life. It is also the case that the mechanisms generally suggested for a causal path from politics to personality seem less likely to produce a causal relationship from polarization to personality than from ideology to personality. We show that strong identifers on both sides are similar. This does not suggest a process whereby people view their personality traits through a prism of their political outlook, nor that people necessarily adopt the traits of people similar to them politically. Equally, our data are partially helpful in resolving worries about causal direction. We take the advice of Boston et al. (2018, p. 862) and employ ‚Äòa more comprehensive battery than TIPI for the main trait of interest‚Äô. Our measurement of personality is not the ten item standard battery for the Big Five, but rather 18 items that separately measure narcissism and then 50 items that measure the Big Five. Equally, our personality questions are measured three months earlier than the political questions, so we might expect that ‚Äòpolitical salience in the survey context‚Äô (Bakker et al., 2021, p. 32) is less of an issue for our study.

That is not to say that we can rule out a reciprocal relationship between narcissism, or personality more generally, and polarization, but it seems likely that even if polarization causes narcissism, narcissism also causes polarization. If so, the challenges for a less polarized polity may be two-fold. First, at the mass level there is the matter of engaging not just more narcissistic people intrinsically attracted to political strife, but also interesting those who are more reluctant to join political groups. Second, at the elite level, there is the difculty of recruiting less narcissistic people who may be less intrinsically enthusiastic about a political career. Neither challenge has obvious solutions. Nonetheless, by enhancing our understanding of the kind of people who are more likely to become afectively polarized, we may be able to develop more efective interventions to reduce the potentially harmful efects of such polarization.","There are increasing concerns about afective polarization between political groups in the US and elsewhere. While most work explaining afective polarization focuses on a combination of social and ideological sorting, we ask whether people‚Äôs personalities are associated with friendliness to their political in-group and hostility to their political out-group. We argue that the personality trait of narcissism (entitled selfimportance) is an important correlate of afective polarization. We test this claim in Britain using nationally representative survey data, examining both long-standing party identities and new Brexit identities. Our fndings reveal that narcissism, and particularly the ‚Äòrivalry‚Äô aspect of narcissism, is associated with both positive and negative partisanship. This potentially not only explains why some people are more susceptible to afective polarization, but also has implications for elite polarization given that narcissism is an important predictor of elite entry.","3",0,"3","Political",4,1

Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice, 27(2), e12312.","There are multiple benefits to include ideological diversity within psychology (APA, 2005). First and foremost, a core principle of professional psychology (APA, 2017a) is that all individuals should be treated fairly and equally. Presumably, this would include individuals with nonliberal ideological beliefs, so including conservatively oriented psychologists would be a sign of compliance with APA's ethical standards.

Achieving a multicultural community has been one of the major goals of the APA (2017b), and the polarization between liberal and conservative ideologies can certainly be viewed as resulting in different cultures. There are obvious advantages to having a community of scholars with diverse perspectives working synergistically to solve problems. Furthermore, as Fowers and Richardson (1996) noted, ‚ÄúThe nurturance of diversity is expected to enrich all of us through understanding and interacting with the multiple sources of meaning and the vastly expanded cultural resources available in a truly multicultural society‚Äù (p. 611). Aside from viewpoint diversity in-group problem-solving and increased creativity, diversity broadens the scope of any community. 

The social sciences have received much criticism for abandoning scientific principles for social advocacy (Redding, 2001; Tetlock, 1994a) both in media and from within the profession. By fostering and disseminating diverse perspectives on social issues, psychology can maintain its scientific credibility and avoid being considered as yet another political special interest group. In addition, having a diversity in viewpoints would help to reduce confirmation bias (Lilienfeld, 2010) and theoretical rigidity, support adversarial collaboration (Duarte et al., 2015) in research, and offer a more balanced perspective on social advocacy issues.

The problems associated with neglecting, or even excluding ideological diversity from psychology are, for the most part, a converse of its advantages. First, excluding psychologists because of their ideological orientation may be unethical. Oppression was defined by the APA (2018) as ‚Äúdiscrimination against and/or denial of resources to members of groups who are identified as inferior or less deserving than others‚Äù (p. 3). Yet data by Inbar and Lammers (2012) suggest that considerable proportions of liberal psychologists would be willing to discriminate and deny resources to psychologists perceived as conservative in paper reviews, grant reviews, symposium invitations, and hiring decision.

Second, multiculturalism is one of the core tenets of professional psychology (APA, 2017b). APA and the profession as a whole have made strenuous efforts to increase and value the representation and input of various minorities. Yet, there is evidence that within their own profession, psychologists may fail to practice the ideals that they espouse with respect to tolerating, let alone welcoming differing cultural views (Duarte et al., 2015; Gartner, 1986; Redding, 2001).

Third, the goals of politically focused advocacy and science may be diametrically opposed in method and aim. Scientific errors and biases can be corrected through further experimentation. Political process errors and biases frequently cannot be corrected because some decisions are irreversible. For example, bias-based rejection of a manuscript for publication that took years to complete can never be reversed as if the rejection never happened. Historically, the scientific method has entailed support of free discussion, exploration of alternative views, and tolerance for dissenting opinions. Ideologically driven scientific agendas exclude competing views and would therefore impair scientific progress.

Aside from the issues mentioned above, ideological hegemony within psychology, or any other scientific discipline, can have other deleterious consequences. The overt domination of psychology by any ideology can lead to a cohesive moral community (Duarte et al., 2015) that binds its members and the profession as a whole into narrow and unproductive pursuits. Furthermore, theoretical rigidity can lead to a distorted set of values in which the aim of scientific research is to provide support for a given theoretical model rather than to seriously test whether it is falsifiable. If such theoretical rigidity is combined with an active and strident social agenda, the profession faces the danger that it will lose its scientific credibility and become just one of many ideological movements (Tetlock, 1994a).

An even more disturbing problem is that many psychologists are becoming afraid of expressing minority views due to concerns over being persecuted for their ideological orientation (Inbar & Lammers, 2012). The entire professional career path of psychologists (e.g., selection to graduate school, indoctrination into the profession in graduate school, selection to internship and residency, selection for a job, job promotion, promotion for tenure, access to research grants, selection to be on a journal review board, selection of a manuscript for publication) is dominated by adherents to a liberal ideology and likely with little cause or impetus to diversify.

Perceptions and accusations of bias in others combined with a denial of bias in the self are common (Pronin, Linn, & Ross, 2002), and many forms of discrimination and bias may develop because in-groups give preference to their own members, not because they wish harm to members of an out-group (Greenwald & Pettigrew, 2014). Behavioral techniques that promote bias can range from the highly overt, such as ad hominem arguments (Harris, 2009), to more subtle forms that are almost impossible to prove in a court of law or administrative hearing. For example, there is evidence that research unsupportive of the liberal ideology is suppressed (Lilienfeld, 2002a, 2002b; Redding, 2001, 2013), while research of dubious quality but supportive of the liberal ideology is published (Duarte et al., 2015; Tetlock, 1994a). As Inbar and Lammers (2012) noted, conservatively oriented psychologists and students have good reasons to fear revealing their political beliefs to their colleagues.

There is scant doubt that liberal ideology pervades professional psychology, and that, at least for the present, some minority ideologies are disenfranchised. According to Haidt (2011), there is a barely believable lack of ideological diversity in the field. The authors' view is that for a scientific community to flourish the members must have a shared set of values that fosters fairness and stability. At the same time, there must be enough freedom to disagree so that new ideas can emerge and can be seriously considered. Furthermore, equilibrium must be maintained between the two extremes of total conformity and total chaos. The equilibrium is always tenuous as new issues and conflicts emerge, and they must be constantly tended to maintain equality among the competing views.

7 | POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS TO IDEOLOGICAL BIAS IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
After having outlined a range of concerns regarding ideological bias and lack of ideological diversity that can affect the practice of clinical psychology, several different principles and approaches are presented below in hopes of remedying these problems. We suggest also that partisan politicking at the organizational level of the APA be addressed via the solutions outlined by O'Donohue and Dyslin (2005), which include limiting political activity to matters in which psychologists have legitimate expertise, ensuring strict adherence to ethical standards pertaining to public statements and explanations of research results, ensuring honest and balanced reviews of contentious topics, and encouraging psychologists' participation in civic and political endeavors in entirely separate organizations devoted to such tasks.

Clinical psychology already demonstrates a concerted effort to reduce the effects of bias through a range of strategies, primarily stemming from the call to adhere to professional ethics, which includes the principle of doing no harm and the recommendation of continuously seeking out multicultural competency (APA, 2017a, 2017b). Stuart (2004) proposes twelve suggestions for achieving multicultural competence, such as, ‚Äúdevelop skill in discovering each person's unique cultural outlook‚Äù and ‚Äúcritically evaluate the methods used to collect culturally relevant data before applying the findings in psychological services‚Äù (p. 6). Stuart suggests that clinicians may consider attempting to change a client's beliefs if deemed necessary. Meanwhile, Wright and Cummings (2005) suggest that the best psychologist:

nonjudgmentally treats a broad spectrum of patients and is not compelled to visibly demonstrate identification with any philosophy, movement, or ideology. This, coupled with experience and effectiveness, helps ensure that psychotherapy will focus on patient needs, not the therapist's agenda.
(p. xxx)

Clearly any effort to shift client beliefs or values should be clinically indicated, ethically consistent, and pursued only following a sensitive and comprehensive understanding of the client's background, presenting problems, needs, and goals, while simultaneously attending to one's own ideological worldview, values, biases, and motivations.

Haidt's (Graham, Haidt, & Nosek, 2009; Haidt, 2013; Haidt & Graham, 2007) research on five core foundational moral values also provides a framework from which muchneeded cultural humility can be fostered. These moral foundations, harm/care, fairness/reciprocity, in-group/ loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity (Graham et al., 2009; Haidt, 2013; Haidt & Graham, 2007) are valued differentially between liberals and conservatives and result in contrasting perspectives on a range of social, economic, and civic topics. Liberals value the first two, harm/care and fairness/reciprocity, relatively more than the others, whereas conservatives value all five moral domains nearly equally (Graham et al., 2009). The ability to understand and accurately, rather than prejudiciously, articulate another's worldview, values, and needs, from a client or colleague to a research study sample, is particularly meaningful given the current political climate. Attention to these foundational moral values provides important insight into the interplay between culture and ideology as well. Ideally, such consideration in conceptualization would be meaningful for professional development and therapeutically enriching for clients. 

Structures (e.g., education, training, supervision) are already in place to foster multicultural competence and humility with regard to many other aspects of diversity. To include ideology as yet another element of cultural and worldview diversity, like religion, would ensure a comparable level of professional service widely expected for other aspects of diversity (APA, 2017b). Conversely, to not account for and accurately comprehend sociopolitical and cultural differences in clients may risk multicultural incompetence. Consideration of ideological diversity is particularly important, for instance, given research indicating that groups tend to split more across ideological lines than ethnic/racial ones and with partisan discrimination topping racial discrimination (Iyengar & Westwood, 2014; Pew Research Center, 2017).

The purpose of this article is to review a specific problem occurring in the broader social sciences and make a case for concern within the practice of clinical psychology. First of all, the extent and ways in which ideological bias affects clinical psychologists and the recipients of their services require significant further exploration. This ought to include ascertaining the present ideological makeup of clinical psychologists, and other mental health professionals, determining the salience of ideological viewpoints held given the increasingly monolithic makeup of the profession, and exploring the myriad ways these viewpoints might influence training/supervision, education, and clinical research, as well as across a range of topics (e.g., Gottfredson, 2005; Josephson v. Postel et al., 2018; Jussim, Stevens, & Honeycutt, 2018; Rubinstein, Jussim, & Stevens, 2018; Schneider, Smith, & Hibbing, 2018). Additionally, further research is needed to understand the potential influence of clinical psychologists' ideological viewpoints on working relationships with clients, including in light of client ideological characteristics and on psychotherapeutic outcomes. 

After identifying the types of problems existing due to lack of ideological diversity on clinical practice, it would be of significant value to determine the practical ways in which clinical psychologists might develop approaches for reducing bias, as discussed earlier. Likely, these would parallel the strategies used to improve multicultural competence and foster humility and sensitivity around other diversity factors. Future research could evaluate the extent of these strategies' success while simultaneously promoting education and resources that could be adopted in graduate-level training settings and educational programs. 

9 | CONCLUSION
The broader social and psychological sciences are characterized by a severe lack of ideological diversity, resulting in a steady and unilateral ideological bias that affects a range of professional activities and relationships. Clinical psychologists as consumers, and co-producers, of research must consider the impact of bias on their clinical research and practice. Failing to effectively monitor the influence of ideological bias in research and practice, in the midst of an ever-polarizing political climate, may continue to threaten the legitimacy of social and psychological sciences and alienate those otherwise in need of psychological services. The most admirable qualities of clinical psychologists (e.g., self-reflection, empathy, and dedication, etc.) may very well be the qualities that allow consideration of the ideological bias problem and foster motivation to develop the knowledge, skills, and desire to approach the provision of clinical services in a nonpartisan and sociopolitically sensitive manner. Not only do clinical psychologists have the foundational skills to accomplish this but also a professional Ethics Code (APA, 2017a) that implicitly and fundamentally requires it through multicultural competence and scientifically informed practice.
","Ideological bias is a worsening but often neglected concern for social and psychological sciences, affecting a range of professional activities and relationships, from self-reported willingness to discriminate to the promotion of ideologically saturated and scientifically questionable research constructs. Though clinical psychologists co-produce and apply social psychological research, little is known about its impact on the profession of clinical psychology. Following a brief review of relevant topics, such as ‚Äúconcept creep‚Äù and the significance of the psychotherapeutic relationship, the relevance of ideological bias to clinical psychology, counterarguments and a rebuttal, clinical applications, and potential solutions are presented. For providing empathic and multiculturally competent clinical services, in accordance with professional ethics, psychologists would benefit from treating ideological diversity as another professionally recognized diversity area.","5",0,"5","Political",5,0

Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 41(6), 631-658.","In this study, we analyzed speeches and tweets delivered by Joe Biden and Donald Trump during the 2020 U.S. presidential election, and tested whether their linguistic styles can be matched with different forms of power. On the basis of their personal history, news reports, and empirical studies, we found converging evidence that Trump would portray coercive power, dominance, naked and revolutionary power, and that Biden would portray collaborative power, prestige, and traditional power. 

For tweets, differences in word frequencies were in the expected direction for 15 out of 20 variables. On the remaining variables, we found no relevant differences. Though Hypothesis 1 called for differences in the use of positive and negative emotion words, barely any difference was observed between the candidates. In contrast, the remaining 6 hypotheses were supported: In line with our reasoning, we found that Biden used more words related to cognitive and social processes and achievement. Thus, Biden‚Äôs word choice in tweets represents cognitive differentiation and emphasis of social bonds, as we would expect from a politician who represents collaborative power (Cheng et al., 2010; ten Brike & Keltner, 2020). Biden‚Äôs tweets used more language typical for a president and a truth teller, and he more often referred to moral values. 

In speeches, with respect to total numbers, 8 out of 20 categories showed the expected differences, whereas 3 categories were contrary to our hypotheses. The remaining categories showed no relevant differences between the two candidates. The three hypotheses concerning achievement, morality, and presidentiality were supported. Biden‚Äôs language resembled that of past presidents, and often used references to achievements and moral virtues, particularly ingroup virtue. This is what we would expect from a leader who celebrates collaborative power because in self-reports this form of power has been linked to values (ten Brinke & Keltner, 2022) as well as high performance-based self-esteem and excellent performance (Cheng et al., 2010). Moreover, with an emphasis on solidarity and ingroup virtue, Biden‚Äôs language is typical of the reliance on prestige as a pathway to power. 

For the hypotheses about emotional, cognitive, and social words, the results were mixed: Contrary to our expectation, Trump had a more positive emotional tone in his speeches than Biden, and the two presidents did not differ in their word usage regarding negative emotions. Further, Biden‚Äôs language was more analytical but Trump‚Äôs language was more cognitively complex. Finally, contrary to Hypothesis 7, Trump used more words related to honesty. These characteristics (i.e., truthful language, positive tone, using social words) may reflect advice from campaign managers or scripted speeches. Furthermore, even though fact-checking has often pointed out that Trump‚Äôs arguments do not hold (Kessler et al., 2021) and many liberals accuse him of being dishonest, millions of people see him as a real ‚Äútruth teller.‚Äù Perhaps one reason for that is that he (and/or his advisers) knows how to prepare speeches in ways that signal truth telling, consistent with his reality TV experience and with other examples of his success in inverting consensus meaning (e.g., ‚Äúfake news‚Äù: Mitchell, 2017).

Another possibility is that Trump feels authentic despite his lies, because his statements reflect his own, if not others‚Äô, view of reality (or, to quote George Costanza: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a lie if you believe it‚Äù, 1989). Deceptive language is characterized by low cognitive complexity because lying requires cognitive resources. Furthermore, lying often produces guilt that is reflected in using more negative emotion words. Finally, liars less often than others use first-person pronouns and the low usage of these pronouns has been associated with discomfort (Newman et al., 2003). Trump was repeatedly reported to be dishonest (Kessler et al., 2021) and prevaricate, but our LIWC analysis indicates that his language is authentic. A possible interpretation is that he feels neither guilt nor discomfort when lying, identifies strongly with what he is saying, and does not worry whether his speeches are consistent. This reasoning would be in line with the assumption that he does not experience increased cognitive load and thus would be able to tell relatively complex stories. 

Results differed somewhat between speeches and tweets. Consistent findings pertained to achievements, presidentiality, and morality (in particular ingroup value): On these categories, which are associated with collaborative power, Biden consistently had higher word usage than Trump. In contrast, language that signals honesty differed between tweets and speeches: In speeches, Trump scored higher than Biden in that category. Overall, the findings regarding the tweets largely supported the predicted connection between power forms and speech styles because 6 out of 7 hypotheses were supported. By contrast, the results of the speeches provided only partial support for the assumption that the language used by the two candidates reflects different forms of power because only 3 out of 7 hypotheses were clearly supported. 

A reason for the difference between the speeches and tweets may be authorship or spontaneity. Speeches are often written by speechwriters, and may thus represent goals and values of both the candidate and the party. By contrast, tweets are often more spontaneous and often written by the candidate himself, who can thus more strongly express his personality and approach to power in that form of communication (Marwick & Boyd, 2011). Thus, the forms of power that characterize the two candidates may be more pronounced in tweets, and indeed the results in tweets were more in line with the results that we had expected on the basis of power theories. (Note, however, that a good staff will generally strive to capture a politician‚Äôs own values and worldview; Pazzanese, 2017. Thus, speeches do remain a useful indicator.) 

Results of the context analysis for tweets were partly in line with our hypothesizing. For example, in Biden‚Äôs tweets the words that co-occured with his own name were related to trustworthiness, achievements, and social processes. By contrast, the words that co-occurred with Biden‚Äôs name in Trump‚Äôs tweets were negative and hostile, as is typical in dominance. Trump tended to self-praise in his tweets, but also to pair his own name with words that may be related to revolutionary power (e.g., ‚Äúderangement‚Äù). 

The exploratory results of the context analysis for speeches support our hypothesizing because, in referring to his own name, Biden also refers to credibility and presidentiality‚Äîterms that represent traditional power. When speaking about Trump, Biden often linked the name to dominance-related words; this raises the intriguing possibility that Biden had some degree of awareness of the difference between his and Trump‚Äôs approaches to power, and perhaps a desire to highlight that difference. Trump, on the other hand, often used negative words in combination with Biden‚Äôs name, which is typical of a leader high in dominance (Cheng et al., 2010). The words that Trump used in co-occurrence with his own name are representative of a high power motive coupled with derogation of competitors. Credibility and presidentiality did not seem to be central. In any case, the interpretation of the results from the context analysis is highly exploratory and should be treated cautiously. Nevertheless, we consider it remarkable to find patterns that resemble the previously identified patterns in linguistic word count on the basis of mere associations with automatic language processing. 

To our knowledge, these findings are the first to compare the linguistic styles of Biden and Trump and to show how these correspond to distinct approaches to using power. The forms of power that we described in the introduction‚Äîcoercive and collaborative power, as reflected in Russell‚Äôs lifecycle of power systems, the dominanceprestige framework as strategies to obtain power, and lay theories of the fundamental nature of power‚Äî were useful in describing the language of the two top politicians. As expected, we found Biden‚Äôs language to be typical of a person who values and projects collaborative power, whereas Trump‚Äôs language was typical of a person who values and projects coercive power. Our empirical approach provides a novel avenue to understand Trump‚Äôs and Biden‚Äôs thinking and behavior because word choice across several contexts and time points is a reliable predictor of individual characteristics, such as beliefs or personality (Slatcher et al., 2007; Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010). In fact, natural language has been suggested to be a more sensitive measure of personality than self-reports (Sterling et al., 2020). As Ng and Bradac (1993) stated, ‚Äúlanguage does more than neutrally inform hearers or readers. It is inevitably an instrument for enacting, recreating, or subverting power‚Äù (p. 1). Our research supports this statement and goes further: Different forms of power can be discerned from different language styles (cf. Fragale, 2006). 

Moreover, supposing Trump and Biden might run for president in 2024, it remains to be shown whether they use the same distinct language styles as they did in their 2020 election battle. Further, as our language analysis provides initial support for viewing Trump as leader who relies on coercive power and Biden as one who relies on collaborative power, we may speculate about voters‚Äô preferences. For example, dominant leaders are favored over prestige leaders in situations of economic uncertainty (e.g., high poverty and unemployment rate; Kakkar and Sivanathan, 2017) and thus people in difficult economic circumstances may prefer a candidate who shows dominance. Should the U.S. economy be in poor shape during the 2024 campaign, this might privilege Trump. On the other hand, U.S. Democrats strive to build a coalition that includes and respects people from diverse demographic, geographic, and political backgrounds; a more collaborative and inclusive style is appropriate for leading in these circumstances (Miller, 2019), giving Biden some advantage. In short, prevailing circumstances that heighten the perceived value of coercive versus collaborative leadership will likely determine which candidate‚Äôs approach to power will succeed.

Limitations and Future Research 
A possible factor contributing to distinct linguistic patterns between Biden and Trump may be party affiliation. Recent research suggests that Republicans differ from Democrats in their language (Jost & Sterling, 2020; Okdie & Rempala, 2019; Robinson et al., 2017). More substantively, research on social dominance theory (Pratto et al., 1994) and authoritarianism suggests that fundamental approaches to power may differ between more liberal and conservative individuals. The notion that party affiliation may account for some of the observed differences represents a potential explanation for, rather than a challenge to, our findings. 

That said, our results for the morality categories may tentatively speak against a partybased explanation. Graham et al. (2009) reported that liberals more often refer to the harm and fairness foundations as compared with binding foundations (ingroup, authority, purity), whereas conservatives refer to all 5 foundations in an equal manner. We found that Biden most often referred to the ingroup and authority foundations, and this cannot be explained by party affiliation. This finding is in line with other research suggesting that language differences between Democratic and Republican elites do not reflect differences in morality or values (Neiman et al., 2016). Thus, power forms or personality may actually be a better predictor of the two politicians‚Äô language for explaining differences in moral word choice. 

Beyond differences in power forms, the position of incumbent versus challenger might contribute to different word choices of the two candidates. Initial evidence suggests that incumbents have a different linguistic style than challengers (Leuprecht & Skillicorn, 2016). For example, we found Trump‚Äôs speeches to be significantly more positive than Biden‚Äôs, although we had expected the opposite based on power theories. It makes sense for an incumbent to stress the positive state of the nation as a reason to support the status quo, whereas challengers must make dissatisfaction more salient to motivate voters to make a change (e.g., Beer & Walton, 1987). 

Further, we do not know whether Biden and Trump actually wrote their speeches or tweets themselves. Probably, tweets are more spontaneous and self-authored; and, indeed, the findings on tweets were more in line with our predictions. Some speeches may be written by others and may pursue specific self-presentational goals (Savoy, 2016; Sch√ºtz, 1993, 1995). This may explain why Trump‚Äôs language in speeches was more cognitively complex than Biden‚Äôs was. Moreover, Trump‚Äôs tweets contained misspelled words, which are not automatically identified by LIWC. Therefore, a small amount of text was not identified with the software.5

Finally, LIWC does not analyze the context in which words were used. To remedy this constraint, we did a context analysis with neighbor words. However, a discourse analysis might offer even more information. That said, qualitative text analysis techniques are somewhat limited in the amount of text that can be analyzed (Kangas, 2014). Thus, we used LIWC as established text analysis software in psychology to detect stable communication differences between the two candidates over time in an objective fashion, and added the context analysis to provide more information regarding word choice. Nevertheless, additional techniques to analyze these communications will provide additional valuable information.

Upcoming studies may benefit from using the theoretical framework suggested here to compare politicians who may use prestige strategies to achieve collaborative power in a traditional system (e.g., Angela Merkel) with those who use dominant strategies to grab coercive power for relatively naked or revolutionary political action (e.g., Jair Bolsonaro). Such analyses would allow for generalization of the associations between forms of power and word usage across leaders and countries. Further, combining linguistic analyses with self-report studies on power may help to identify the speech style of a person with high (or low) forms of collaborative or coercive power. Finally, it is relevant to study whether people who value coercive power and think dominance is necessary for an effective leader are more likely to vote for a politician who projects that form of power than one who projects collaborative power. 

Conclusion 
Joe Biden and Donald Trump differ remarkably in their language styles. This difference can partly explained by the different forms of power they value and project. The quote ‚ÄúLanguage is power‚Äù (1983, p. 77) by writer Angela Carter is more topical than ever; however, a more nuanced view seems necessary. Different forms of power are characterized by different language. Thus, individuals representing collaborative power differ from those who represent coercive power in their specific linguistic style. The present study shows that power theories bear a considerable potential to better understand politicians‚Äô communications and interpret language usage in general.","Can theories of power be used to explain differences in the linguistic styles of Donald Trump and Joe Biden? We argue that the two candidates possess and use different forms of power‚Äîand that this is associated with typical language patterns. Based on their personal history, news reports, and empirical studies, we expect that Trump‚Äôs approach to power is characterized by coercive power forms and Biden‚Äôs by collaborative power forms. Using several LIWC categories and the moral foundations dictionary, we analyzed over 500 speeches and 15,000 tweets made during the 2020 election battle. Biden‚Äôs speeches can be described as analytical and frequently relating to moral values, whereas Trump‚Äôs speeches were characterized by a positive emotional tone. In tweets, Biden used more social words and words related to virtue, honesty, and achievement than Trump did. Trump‚Äôs coercive power and Biden‚Äôs collaborative power were more observable in tweets than speeches, which may reflect the fact that tweets are more spontaneous than speeches.","4",0,"4","Political",3,0

PloS one, 13(7), e0200103.","Two surveys, weighted to be nationally representative (total N = 2,821), found that nearly twothirds of Americans believe that they are more intelligent than average. The survey methods (telephone, online) yielded similar overall agreement rates after weighting responses to match the U.S. population in sex, age, and race/ethnicity. In both surveys, men were more likely to express confidence in their intelligence than were women, and younger people were somewhat more likely to agree with the claim than older people._x000D_
_x000D_
These beliefs about relative intelligence appeared to be somewhat calibrated: Highly educated individuals were more likely to agree that they are more intelligent than the average person, whereas relatively uneducated individuals were less likely to agree [21, 31, 32]. Still, even among the least educated group of respondents, 50% or more agreed that they were above average in intelligence. These findings are consistent with several major theories of overconfidence: that the least intelligent are the most overconfident [30]; that self-perceptions are somewhat calibrated to reality [33]; and that comparative self-judgments regress toward the mean when collected from groups of educated and uneducated individuals [34, 35]. _x000D_
_x000D_
Our results do not explain why 65% of Americans agree that they are more intelligent than average. Several explanations are plausible [36]. First, although one-item, self-report measures of global intelligence correlate positively with IQ scores [37], participants may conceive of intelligence more broadly [38] and select that aspect of intelligence where they believe they outperform others. If so, more than 50% of people might actually be above average in some aspect of intelligence even if only 50% can be above average on IQ. Still, our finding that more educated people are more likely to agree suggests that participants are thinking to at least some extent about general intelligence. _x000D_
_x000D_
Second, people may choose different baselines when comparing themselves to ‚Äúthe average person.‚Äù If people define ‚Äúaverage‚Äù differently, perhaps based on who they encounter regularly [39], then more than 50% of respondents might report greater than average intelligence. Note that for this possibility to hold true and to be inconsistent with overly optimistic beliefs, people would need to systematically calibrate their notion of average downward (less intelligent people would need to choose a lower ‚Äúaverage‚Äù than more intelligent people). Finally, it may simply be the case that people are somewhat calibrated, though overly optimistic on average, in their beliefs about their own intelligence [35]. _x000D_
_x000D_
Because these results were collected from and weighted based on the United States population, we caution against generalizing our findings before they are replicated in other cultures and regions. Our methodology was limited by the static question order presented to participants. Although we had no a priori reason to expect an order effect in this context, future research should consider this possibility. In a nationally representative study of Americans‚Äô beliefs about competency in handling firearms, overconfidence was measured using a similar one-item, direct comparison measure [40]. The authors reported no difference in overconfidence regardless of whether or not there was a neutral scale midpoint. These results were similar across 2-, 3-, 5-, and 13-point rating scales. Thus, we have no reason to believe that including a neutral midpoint would have meaningfully affected our results. The education-based analysis was limited to comparisons based on population characteristics, not objectively measured individual performance. _x000D_
_x000D_
Despite these limitations, we conclude that Americans‚Äô self-flattering beliefs about intelligence are alive and well several decades after their discovery was first reported. Our results update the textbook phenomenon of intelligence overconfidence by (1) replicating the effect using large, representative, contemporary samples and two distinct survey methods, (2) demonstrating a degree of calibration across levels of education, and (3) showing moderation based on sex and age. The endurance of the smarter-than-average effect is consistent with the possibility that a tendency to overrate one‚Äôs own abilities is a stable feature of human psychology._x000D_","Psychologists often note that most people think they are above average in intelligence. We sought robust, contemporary evidence for this ‚Äúsmarter than average‚Äù effect by asking Americans in two independent samples (total N = 2,821) whether they agreed with the statement, ‚ÄúI am more intelligent than the average person.‚Äù After weighting each sample to match the demographics of U.S. census data, we found that 65% of Americans believe they are smarter than average, with men more likely to agree than women. However, overconfident beliefs about one‚Äôs intelligence are not always unrealistic: more educated people were more likely to think their intelligence is above average. We suggest that a tendency to overrate one‚Äôs cognitive abilities may be a stable feature of human psychology.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,1

Arslan et al. asserted that they could not replicate previously reported moderators. Yet, as reported in their online materials, they found ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù effects at the conventional Œ± criterion of .05 as established in their preregistration, and even when using the more stringent Œ± of .01 they adopted in their paper, with œÅ as low as .003. In the present commentary, we report additional analyses consistent with the existence of moderator effects of substantial and meaningful size, including analyses using a corrected measure of partner ST attractiveness and analyses using a more valid five-component measure of partner sexual attractiveness. Thus, based on Arslan et al.‚Äôs own analyses, and buttressed by our additional analyses, we find that Arslan et al.‚Äôs conclusion of no evidence for moderator effects is unwarranted. _x000D_
_x000D_
That said, we do not claim that Arslan et al.‚Äôs data provide definitive evidence for meaningful moderator effects on the relation between fertility and women‚Äôs EP sexual interests or male partners‚Äô mate retention tactics. Indeed, a major thrust of our commentary is that mere binary data interpretation‚Äîinterpreting findings as being either in favor or not in favor of true effects‚Äîis insufficient. In the present instance, point estimates are consistent with substantial and theoretically meaningful moderator effects. At the same time, confidence intervals cannot rule out small true effects (or, naturally, effects much larger than point estimates). Rarely can a single study pinpoint true effect sizes (Maxwell et al., 2015). _x000D_
_x000D_
One might argue that, despite robust effects in the larger robustness sample, we must abide by (largely but not totally) null findings in preregistered analyses. Preregistration constrains researchers‚Äô analytic degrees of freedom. However, it should not prevent us from thinking through the implications of analyses, both preregistered and nonpreregistered. Arslan et al.‚Äôs preregistered analyses had two major limitations that attenuated power: the sample size was far short of the target, and the use of discrete fertility windows is known to underperform the continuous fertility measure. Nevertheless, analyses we performed on a preregistered sample of 123 and Arslan et al.‚Äôs primary sample of 143 yielded effect size estimates that slightly exceeded those in the robustness analyses. _x000D_
_x000D_
One could fairly argue that, because two sets of outcomes concerning sexual interests‚ÄîEP and IP‚Äîwere examined and only one set yielded effects, those effect size estimates may be overestimated. However, this point does not justify complete dismissal of findings, particularly when the prior literature offers more support for effects on EP interests (Larson et al., 2012). _x000D_
_x000D_
The Implications of Detailed and Nuanced Reports of Findings _x000D_
Amrhein et al. (2019) call for more ‚Äúdetailed and nuanced‚Äù reports of results, beyond reports of significance tests (p. 307). More detailed and nuanced description of the results in Arslan et al.‚Äôs data may fundamentally affect how readers and scholars in the field regard the current state of the evidence. As Arslan et al. rightly note, prior studies purporting to show evidence for moderation effects have involved small samples, were underpowered, were not preregistered, and could have yielded results influenced by researcher degrees of freedom. Individually, these prior studies hardly constitute strong evidence for moderation._x000D_
_x000D_
Yet, Arslan et al. conducted their study with the expressed aim of evaluating the robustness of prior effects, including moderation. They claim that, ‚Äú[i]n contrast to previous reports‚Äù (p. 428), they ‚Äúcould not replicate previously reported moderators,‚Äù (p. 426). From this conclusion, it would be reasonable for readers to surmise that Arslan et al.‚Äôs results cast doubt on previous reports. However, as our analyses (as well as Arslan et al.‚Äôs own analyses) of their data show, it is a mistake to believe that their findings markedly contrast with those of prior studies. A more detailed and nuanced reporting of Arslan et al.‚Äôs findings makes a notable difference in the message readers may take away from this study. Indeed, in light of its strengths, Arslan et al.‚Äôs study may be the single study offering the best evidence to date for meaningful moderation effects. _x000D_
_x000D_
Additional future studies are needed to further inform effect size estimations for moderated fertility effects. Yet, conclusions should not be drawn from single studies in isolation of others, as effect size estimates should be based on an aggregation of pertinent studies (Cumming, 2014; Gelman, 2018). _x000D_
_x000D_
Conclusions _x000D_
As we noted at the outset, Arslan et al.‚Äôs study possesses several impressive qualities: Large sample size in the robustness sample relative to previous studies; dense behavioral sampling; preregistered hypotheses; and an array of robustness analyses. Preregistration of hypotheses and methods increases transparency and should make clear to readers which methodological decisions were preplanned and which were post hoc. Preregistration and related open science practices, however, do not ensure that replication reports yield correct inferences. ‚ÄúDichotomania‚Äù (Amrhein et al., 2019, p. 306)‚Äî binning results as significant or nonsignificant‚Äî can lead researchers to conclude that they failed to replicate findings in the literature when results are actually compatible with meaningful true effects (Maxwell et al., 2015). Though there should be no ‚Äúbright red line‚Äù between significant and nonsignificant effects, aversion to Type I errors may inadvertently lead replication researchers to emphasize binary decisions and not entertain the possibility that true effects exist, absent unadulterated support for them. _x000D_
_x000D_
These concerns pertain not to research methodology broadly, but rather to reporting standards. Although rampant misinterpretation of null results is clearly undesirable, the attention that these issues have garnered and solutions proposed are encouraging (Amrhein et al., 2019; Cumming, 2014; Gelman, 2018; Maxwell et al., 2015). Thus, we end on a positive note. At times, solutions to a problem are prompted by apparent emergencies, such as a lack of replication of key effects within a literature. Arslan et al.‚Äôs treatment of their moderator analyses is one such demonstration‚Äîan attempt to shed light on a seemingly murky area of science through preregistration and an ambitious replication effort. As we have shown, however, their reporting of results was incomplete and, hence, did not accurately characterize their findings. In light of more detailed and nuanced reporting of their results, Arslan et al.‚Äôs assertions that their analyses yielded no evidence for moderation effects, in contrast to past studies, are unwarranted. Indeed, Arslan et al.‚Äôs study may offer the most compelling evidence for moderation effects to date. Better reporting standards, the outlines of which are at hand, could prevent similar reporting problems in the future. We look forward to their widespread adoption._x000D_","Arslan et al. (2020) conducted a large-scale, preregistered daily diary study on over 400 normally ovulating women. Of core interest were hypotheses that women‚Äôs ratings of their partner‚Äôs sexual attractiveness moderate associations of fertility status with women‚Äôs own extrapair sexual desires, their own interest in in-pair sex, and their partners‚Äô mate retention tactics. The authors claim that ‚Äúno evidence for moderator effects‚Äù (p. 426) was found. In fact, their own analyses reported in their supplementary material show robust evidence for moderation effects. Moreover, a new reanalysis using a more comprehensive composite measure of male partner sexual attractiveness yielded even stronger results. Effect size estimates are consistent with the existence of large, meaningful moderation effects, revealing that this study actually does show evidence of moderation effects. Additional analyses show similarly strong moderator effects on male proprietariness. We discuss the findings in the context of reliance on binary (significant vs. nonsignificant) labels and the pitfalls of underreporting effects.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,1

Dominance motivated delusions: Whites with high social dominance orientation perceive equal amounts of institutional racism between Blacks and Whites. Group Processes & Intergroup Relations, 26(6), 1244-1270.","The current study found evidence that SDO, victim race (Black vs. White), and discrimination type (institutional vs. individual) influence whether Whites will consider racial discrimination evidence of racism. Research suggests Whites tend to perceive discrimination when a White actor harms a Black target, but they are less likely to perceive discrimination when a Black actor harms a White target (Corning & Bucchianeri, 2010; O‚ÄôBrien et al., 2008). Although we expected victim race and discrimination type to reverse this asymmetry for Whites with higher SDO (i.e., White victims yielding more labels of racism than Black victims), the patterns did not achieve full reversal. Results from all studies, however, demonstrated consistent patterns of a previously identified asymmetry for Whites with lower SDO and the disappearance of this pattern for Whites with higher SDO. This suggests the observed effects are robust. Moreover, these findings align with research demonstrating higher SDO reduces perceptions of disparities between racial groups (Kteily et al., 2017), which might explain why the expected asymmetry did not emerge for Whites with higher SDO.

The findings regarding RLS do suggest important differences between Whites with higher and lower SDO, however. Whites with lower SDO consistently labeled incidents racist when victims were Black regardless of the type of discrimination. This is surprising, particularly for the institutional instances, given Whites rely on intent when determining whether an outcome is racist (Simon et al., 2017) and intent is often masked for institutional discrimination, which can make it difficult for Whites to detect (Bonam et al., 2019; Nelson et al., 2013). Perhaps Whites with lower SDO were driven to rely on prototypical information when making judgments because they were uncertain and wanted to avoid giving the impression of being racist themselves (Bergsieker et al., 2010). Another explanation comes from research suggesting Whites with lower SDO accurately detect inequality directed toward disadvantaged but not advantaged groups (Waldfogel et al., 2021). Relatedly, Whites with low prejudice are sometimes biased in favor of Blacks (Norton et al., 2006), which may mean participants overcorrected when making judgments to ensure minimal harm against Blacks. Alternatively, and more hopeful however, our findings might also suggest Whites with lower SDO account for power and historical inequalities when assessing discrimination (Bonam et al., 2019; Nelson et al., 2013). That is, some Whites might understand the historical and systematic disadvantages Blacks face, and how individual and institutional factors work in concert to produce and perpetuate anti-Black racism (Bonilla-Silva, 2006).

Like Whites with lower SDO, it is possible those with higher SDO were also driven by a desire to avoid appearing racist. For Whites with lower SDO, this drive may have manifested as labeling any incident involving a Black victim as evidence of racism (Corning & Bucchianeri, 2010; Inman & Baron, 1996). For Whites with higher SDO, however, perhaps offering noncommittal responses (i.e., around the scale midpoint; 4 = maybe an example of racism) regardless of victim race was an attempt to escape being labeled a racist (Apfelbaum et al., 2008). Given institutional racism is difficult for Whites to identify (Bonam et al., 2019; Nelson et al., 2013), Whites with higher SDO may not have felt confident in their ability to accurately recognize instances of racism, which led them to give similar (i.e., colorblind) racism ratings for Black and White victims.

Another interpretation is Whites with higher SDO might apply a colorblind approach when evaluating institutional forms of discrimination. Not distinguishing between Black and White victims suggests they could believe any negative action based on race constitutes racism. Although ignoring race when making judgments is sometimes done to protect Blacks (Goff et al., 2013), research finds such motivations are not likely driving Whites with higher SDO. Moreover, this colorblind approach aligns with findings demonstrating Whites with higher SDO sometimes construe colorblindness as a procedural mandate, such that people should not be treated differently on the basis of race regardless of whether the differential treatment is to correct for historical racial injustice (Knowles et al., 2009). However, we did not find evidence that colorblind attitudes (or meritocracy) were related to RLS. We also did not find evidence that White privilege or zero-sum beliefs were related to RLS.

Nevertheless, the overall pattern of our findings is consistent with tactics Whites with higher SDO use to maintain their dominance. That is, in the absence of any real change to the racial social order (i.e., intergroup threat), labeling institutional instances of discrimination as equally racist regardless of victim race could be advantageous because it subtly maintains the status quo. For instance, research finds when Whites with higher SDO perceive their dominant position to be stable, they do not evaluate Black and White victims of discrimination differently (Unzueta et al., 2014). Given Whites‚Äîeven those who view themselves as egalitarian‚Äîrarely support policies that would remediate racial inequality (Smith, 2020), Whites with higher SDO might not have felt threatened because of the low likelihood that wide-sweeping institutional reform that would upset the racial hierarchy will ever take place.

Altogether, our results demonstrate high-SDO Whites‚Äô perceptions of racism are dynamic and shift depending on the victim‚Äôs race (Black vs. White) and the type of discrimination (institutional vs. individual)‚Äîall in service of ensuring the racial hierarchy remains intact. Because Whites with higher SDO conceive of individual racism as the result of racist individuals‚Äîand not evidence of systemic bias (O‚ÄôBrien et al., 2009)‚Äîoverclaiming White victimhood relative to Blacks is not necessarily advantageous. However, claiming equal victimhood with Blacks for institutional forms of racism allows Whites with higher SDO to promote race-neutral policies (e.g., colorblindness), which ultimately maintain White societal dominance (Knowles et al., 2009; Kolber, 2017).

Limitations and Future Research
It is important to note some limitations of the current research. As alluded to previously, we measured but did not manipulate intergroup threat. Given previous research has found Whites with higher SDO change their attitudes depending on perceived threats to their position (e.g., Knowles et al., 2009; Unzueta et al., 2014), future research should manipulate intergroup threat when examining whether Whites with higher SDO view discrimination as evidence of racism. It is also important to note our samples demonstrated relatively low SDO. On a 7-point scale, the SDO means were well below the scale midpoint (all Ms < 2.45, all SDs < 1.06). This may explain why patterns for Whites with higher SDO were relatively flat between White and Black victims. Future research should test these questions in samples with higher SDO, as it may be that Whites with higher SDO (i.e., above the scale midpoint) would demonstrate a full reversal of the pattern shown by Whites with lower SDO.

Future research should also explore interventions that might help Whites with higher SDO perceive disparities in racial discrimination more accurately. Previous research demonstrates self-affirmations help buffer Whites‚Äô identity against racially threatening information (Lowery et al., 2006; Unzueta & Lowery, 2008). Such interventions may also allow Whites with higher SDO to properly process information about racial inequality.

Implications
To return to the BLM protests and the Capitol siege comparison, Whites‚Äô reactions illustrate how dominance motives can explain the paradoxical logic some Whites employ. White Republicans are less likely to support protests by Black people, only 19% of White Republicans (compared to 85% of White Democrats) supported the BLM protests, and SDO predicts White opposition to BLM (Holt & Sweitzer, 2018; Pew Research Center, 2020; PRRI, 2020). However, half of Republican voters supported the Capitol siege (Sanders et al., 2021). One explanation 82% of White Republicans offered for their (non)support of BLM was that BLM protests were comprised of people who were ‚Äútaking advantage of the situation to engage in criminal behavior‚Äù (Parker et al., 2020). Yet, destruction of property and criminal behavior by Whites storming the Capitol did not seem meaningful factors for White Republicans‚Äô support of the siege.

Beyond perceptions of these two events, we also see evidence of some Whites‚Äô warped perceptions of racism. For instance, 57% of Republicans think Whites face a lot of discrimination, which almost matches the amount (52%) who believe Blacks experience a lot of discrimination (PRRI, 2020). However, only 17% of Republicans believe racial inequality (presumably against Blacks) is a critical issue (PRRI, 2020). These strategic shifts in logic to justify their positions are consistent with tactics Whites with higher SDO use to maintain dominance (Knowles et al., 2009; Unzueta et al., 2012, 2014). Moreover, these distorted perceptions and seemingly SDO-motivated beliefs directly map on to the results of the current study; some Whites believe they experience similar amounts of racism as Blacks.

Such blatant bias in perceptions and judgments regarding the extent of racism against Blacks is crucial to identify if societies ever truly hope to strive for racial justice. In line with this sentiment, it is important to be clear that the 2020 BLM protests were not identical to the Capitol siege. One was a legitimate response (even if it had been violent) from a social group plagued by historical and contemporary racial bias and violent oppression (Bonilla-Silva, 2006; Pager & Shepherd, 2008). The other was an attempted insurrection fueled by authoritarianism and a refusal to cede political power‚Äîall of which have only been justified by unfounded claims of voter fraud in the 2020 U.S. presidential election (Seitz, 2021). The distinguishing factor between the BLM protests and the Capitol siege is perceived versus actual oppression; the violence used by the oppressed to get free is not identical to the violence used by the oppressor to control (Freire, 1921/2000).

Remediating racial inequality has always been an important goal for societies, and the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated racial disparities in employment and health care access, put a spotlight on racial disparities in policing, and created a context that has galvanized newfound support for racial justice movements (Marshburn et al., 2021). These conditions highlight the increasing importance for research to identify when resistance to achieving racial inequality is nothing more than strategic dominance-fueled manifestations of denial. However, researchers must also avoid investigating only the perpetrators of anti-Black racism denial. As recent work notes, race research, including the current study, overrelies on White participants‚Äô perceptions of race-related issues (Roberts et al., 2020). Ultimately, although it is crucial to filter out perspectives that only serve to perpetuate inequality for the sake of maintaining intergroup dominance, in the fight for racial justice, it is critical we include‚Äîand prioritize‚Äîperspectives and voices from the primary victims of racism.","Whites display an asymmetry when detecting discrimination‚Äîdisparate treatment from high-status groups directed toward low-status groups constitutes discrimination but not the opposite. Whites also believe they experience just as much racial discrimination as Blacks. This latter pattern could be especially true for Whites with higher social dominance orientation (SDO)‚Äîpreference for intergroup dominance and inequality. Three studies (including one pilot study) investigated whether Whites with higher (vs. lower) SDO perceived examples of institutional and individual instances of racial discrimination as evidence of racism when happening to White (vs. Black) victims. Results revealed partial support for our prediction that the asymmetry in discrimination detection for Whites with higher (vs. lower) SDO would be opposite to the previously identified asymmetry, especially for examples of institutional (vs. individual) discrimination. Implications are discussed in the context of the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests and 2021 Capitol siege.","1",0,"1","Political",2,0

Journal of Social and Political Psychology, 5(1), 244-259.","Taken in total, these results provide support for a connection between the salience of restrictive communication norms and support for Donald Trump. Participants primed to think about restrictive communication norms showed more support for Trump than participants who were not so primed. Further, participants who felt chronic reactance to communication norms were especially likely to express support for Trump (above and beyond their political ideology), and were further especially likely to respond to the prime by increasing Trump support. In the main, these results either did not hold ‚Äì or were reversed ‚Äì for supporting Clinton. 

These results are not without their limitations and interpretational ambiguities, however. We first address those limitations and then discuss, in larger perspective, what we can learn from these results.

Interpretation Obstacles 

Lack of Mediation by Chronic Concern Measurements 
One of the interpretational ambiguities in the present results involves the fact that, although chronic concern measurements largely predicted support for Trump (and opposition to Clinton) across the whole sample, these measurements did not also mediate the relationship between the Restrictive Communication Prime and Trump Support. If the Prime operates by heightening the salience of restrictive communication norms, why would these measurements not partially account for the effect of the prime on candidate preference? 

A few points suggest that this lack of mediation was likely the result of our reactance and informational contamination measurements being too stable to effectively serve as the mediator for the effect of a temporary prime. First, at face value, the questions were written at a very general level to apply to any political group, norm, or politician. Prior work that showed the mediation of emotional reactance and informational contamination on PC norm priming was written specifically for a very clearly identified scenario ‚Äì thus the overall psychological distance between the prime, proposed mediator, and dependent measure was far less in that work than in the present study (see Conway et al., 2009). As an initial test of the possibility that this helps account for our results, we took the three questions from the trait positivity rating that were most related to scenario-specific concern with communication norms and combined them into a single measurement of scenario-specific concern with communication norms (all reverse-scored; alpha = .87). The three items were: ‚ÄúI appreciate that Donald Trump seems to say whatever is on his mind, even if it upsets people,‚Äù ‚ÄúFor the most part, I trust Donald Trump to speak truthfully,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDonald Trump goes against cultural norms that restrict free speech, and that‚Äôs a good thing.‚Äù We then used this measurement as the mediator an A(Prime)‚ÜíB(Mediator)‚ÜíC(Outcome) analysis of indirect effects. (To avoid too much overlap between related measurements, we used only voting preference as the outcome measurement. Results are identical if we use the overall Trump Support measurement). Results suggested a significant indirect effect of the newly-constructed, Trump-specific communication norms measurement (beta = .50; lower CI = .04; upper CI = .96; Sobel test z = 2.16; p =.03). We recognize that this measurement has some method overlap (and that is one of the reasons why we did not use it as the primary measurement of the construct in the first place) and it should be interpreted cautiously. However, it is at least consistent with the notion that there was a more transient communication-relevant mediator of the present results. 

Second, the chronic measurements of emotional reactance and informational contamination did interface with the prime; however, they interfaced as one would expect a measurement that is more chronic and thus less subject to direct temporal fluctuations. Specifically, these measurements served as fairly consistent moderators of the prime‚Üísupport relationship. 

Third, these chronic measurements were predictive overall of support for Trump (and especially, opposition to Clinton) in ways that are generally consistent with predictions (with some caveats we return to later in the discussion). This is again consistent with their status as a more stable measurement that is relevant to the proposed outcomes at a larger, more stable level. 

Finally, these results do not stand alone. Although they are unique in their application of political correctness priming to Trump support, other work shows the potential backfiring of communication norms and artificial consensus in other domains (Conway & Schaller, 2005; Conway et al., 2009). As a result, in the larger theoretical landscape, there is reason to believe that concern with restrictive communication norms may have an impact in the present work. Taken together, this evidence suggests that while the lack of direct mediation by those measurements is a weakness in the present results, we feel there is ample reason to nonetheless trust that the larger picture emerging here is one best captured by a theoretical angle focusing on concern with restrictive communication. Inconsistency of Chronic Concern With Communication Norms? Another interpretational ambiguity lies in the fact that Trump Support was predicted by chronic emotional reactance but not chronic informational contamination. What are we to make of this inconsistency? One possibility is that Trump simply evokes more emotional deviance than cognitive deviance. Reactance is more purely emotive (see Knowles & Linn, 2004); informational contamination is more purely cognitive (see Conway & Schaller, 2005; Conway et al., 2009). Recall that in prior research and theory these two types of deviance are independent predictors of cultural norms backfiring. Every theoretically sound predictor cannot predict every phenomenon ‚Äì and in this case, it may be rather instructive that it is emotional reactance, and not informational contamination, that predicts Trump support. To the degree this is true, it suggests that it is more of a guttural emotive dislike of restriction than a cognitive erosion of information that is behind Donald Trump‚Äôs support. 

Indeed, it is noteworthy that these results actually show an interesting set of consistencies across analyses that partially support this conclusion. (1) First, not only was emotional reactance a significant predictor of Trump support overall, it (and not informational contamination) was a significant moderator of the effect of the prime on Trump support. This suggests the prime is having its effect on people who have a chronic emotional dislike of restrictive communication norms, more so than people who are cognitively concerned with informational contamination. (2) Equally as interestingly, informational contamination had much more of an impact on support for Clinton (compared to support for Trump) in the opposite direction, both as a direct predictor and as a moderator of the prime‚ÜíClinton support relationship. While it is difficult to fully know how to interpret this and any interpretation must remain speculative, it is at least consistent with the notion that support for Clinton is more of a function of cognitive concerns than is support for Trump.

What Can We Learn? 
At a minimum, these results provide evidence that (a) priming restrictive communication norms and (b) chronic emotional reactance against those norms both increased support for Donald Trump during the general election. These results help us in our theoretical understanding of culture in multiple ways. First, they provide for the first time to the authors‚Äô knowledge an experimentally-manipulated example of a cultural norm‚Äôs ironic effect on a realworld political example. Indeed, a reasonable criticism of much of the past work on the backfiring effect of cultural norms is that it focuses on hypothetical scenarios that are removed from the real world (see, e.g., Conway et al., 2009). While this prior work has value, it is important to establish any set of effects in real contexts that truly matter to people, and the present study does just that. 

Second, these results also contribute to the larger theoretical discussion about how cultures emerge, change, and have influence. It is noteworthy that, unlike in prior research on the backfiring of communication norms, the prime in this study bore little direct linguistic overlap with the outcome measurement (support for Donald Trump). As a result, it suggests the pervasive value of understanding the eventual emergence of controversial political figures through the lens of communication-based theories of cultural norms and cultural deviance. 

Cultures emerge and change for many reasons. These can be considered in two basic categories: (1) Top-down ecological or political pressures ‚Äì such as frontier topography or dictatorial political systems ‚Äì may directly constrain how culture emerges (e.g., Conway et al., 2014; Kitayama, Conway, Pietromonaco, Park, & Plaut, 2010; Murray & Schaller, 2014; Van de Vliert, 2013). (2) However, often communication processes operate independent of these top-down pressures to shape the emergence and influence of culture (e.g., Conway, 2004; Conway & Schaller, 2007; Conway, Sexton, & Tweed, 2006; Schaller, Conway, & Tanchuk, 2002). The present study falls squarely at the intersection of these two categories. It suggests that the top-down pressures that often shape culture are themselves subject to communication and psychological processes that direct their influence. If the top-down communication norms are too heavy-handed, they may indeed create a forced consensus; but that consensus is psychologically fragile and prone to break. The present results thus complement prior work on hypothetical scenarios, providing a very important bellwether test for the degree that large-scale cultural norms might ironically rebound. They suggest that instead of producing the niceness that they are intended to produce, these norms instead might lead to more nasty political discourse in the long-term.

Third, these results contribute to the larger literature on the importance of the immediate context to political decisions. Consider, for example, work on framing that demonstrates the specific way a particular finding is discussed ‚Äì or framed ‚Äì can have a great deal of impact on political attitudes and behaviors (Bizer, Larsen, & Petty, 2011; Bizer & Petty, 2005; Brewer & Gross, 2005; de Vreese, Boomgaarden, & Semetko, 2011). Some of this works suggests that positive framing of news articles can increase the likelihood of endorsement of a specific opinion (e.g., de Vreese et al., 2011). Other work shows that framing an attitude as an ‚Äúopposition‚Äù to something increases the subsequent longevity of the opinion and its strength (Bizer & Petty, 2005; Bizer et al., 2011).ix 

Like this prior work on framing, our work also suggests a mechanism by which the immediate context can influence political attitudes. Specifically, our work suggests that the immediate salience of chronic communication norms may aid candidates who appear to violate those norms. Thus, communication norms can function psychologically in much the same way that frames can by focusing persons on a part of the context that ultimately shapes their attitudes and decisions. 

Finally, these results also demonstrate the value of applying both existing social psychological theory and experimental methods to understand puzzles in the modern world. A descriptive illustration of this power can be seen in Figure 1. Looking at the raw mean scores for voting preference ‚Äì the clearest marker in our study of the likelihood of potential cultural change ‚Äì reveals a powerful pattern: In control conditions, Clinton was soundly preferred to Trump (Clinton M = 3.66, SD = 2.41; Trump M = 2.63, SD = 2.28), but when Political Correctness norms were made salient, this gap virtually disappeared (Clinton M = 3.48, SD = 2.51; Trump M = 3.32, SD = 2.51).

Concluding Thoughts
Although Donald Trump presents an interesting paradox of sorts to modern political pundits, his emergence is precisely what a theory focusing on the backfiring of social norms would expect. It is a paradox, but a theoretically expected one: As restrictive norms become ever more salient and heavy-handed, the more they will work in the short-term. But in the long-term, this salient heavy-handedness increases the likelihood that they will ultimately backfire. And this backfiring doesn‚Äôt just occur for norms that are genuinely repressive to political freedom ‚Äì it also occurs for norms that have a clearly good and noble aim.

The present study suggests that communication norms that are designed to increase the amount of positive communication may ultimately backfire in political figures like Donald Trump ‚Äì figures who do anything but increase the amount of positive communication. His emergence should serve as a lesson for students of cultural change and deviance. He is not the first and will certainly not be the last example of popular figures emerging in response to restrictive norms‚Äìand the present work illustrates specific psychological processes that help us better understand why that occurs and when it will occur.","Donald Trump has consistently performed better politically than his negative polling indicators suggested he would. Although there is a tendency to think of Trump support as reflecting ideological conservatism, we argue that part of his support during the election came from a non-ideological source: The preponderant salience of norms restricting communication (Political Correctness ‚Äì or PC ‚Äì norms). This perspective suggests that these norms, while successfully reducing the amount of negative communication in the short term, may produce more support for negative communication in the long term. In this framework, support for Donald Trump was in part the result of over-exposure to PC norms. Consistent with this, on a sample of largely politically moderate Americans taken during the General Election in the Fall of 2016, we show that temporarily priming PC norms significantly increased support for Donald Trump (but not Hillary Clinton). We further show that chronic emotional reactance towards restrictive communication norms positively predicted support for Trump (but not Clinton), and that this effect remains significant even when controlling for political ideology. In total, this work provides evidence that norms that are designed to increase the overall amount of positive communication can actually backfire by increasing support for a politician who uses extremely negative language that explicitly violates the norm.","5",0,"5","Political",4,1

Personality and Individual Differences, 215, 112393.","Our results provide relatively consistent evidence for men‚Äôs upper body strength being a heuristic for specific coalitional status and related motivations. Participants viewed strong men to espouse more conservative viewpoints, providing a perceptual corollary for work showing how social bargaining power through strength shapes endorsement of social rules (e.g., Petersen et al., 2013; Price et al., 2011, 2017). Coalitional inferences could facilitate recognizing social affordances related to the costs and opportunities of formidable male conspecifics in group living. Formidable men could be viewed a threatening due to their reliance on aggressive social bargaining (Brown, Tracy, & Boykin, 2022), which could threaten resource acquisition goals of opposing coalition members, particularly coalitions favoring more equalitarian social systems (Price et al., 2017). Conversely, formidability could represent an opportunity to ensure group access to resources through increased protection in competitive environments and opportunities to generate wealth for other group members (Brown et al., 2022, g). 

Interestingly, as indexed by our one-sample t-tests in Study 1, physically weak men appeared neither conservative nor liberal. The basis of affordance judgments for liberal ideologies through physical features could be unrelated to formidability. Inferences of liberal ide ologies could be rooted in perceptions of warmth, which could be less salient to perceivers in male targets. Liberals prefer warm leaders (Laustsen & Petersen, 2016), which could be rooted in selecting coalitions averse to antagonism. Future research could present faces varying in levels of warmth for participants to assess their ideology. 

Perceptions of conservatism were not specific to any domain of conservatism. This could suggest considerable overlap between the ancestral goals of formidable men that manifest as modern conservatism (Sinn & Hayes, 2018). The fiscal dimension may represent interest in resource allocation from formidable men‚Äôs advantage in direct competition. The social dimension could represent interest in instilling rigid social hierarchies to facilitate increased aggressive intergroup contact favored by formidable men (Price et al., 2017; Sell et al., 2017). Study 3 provides converging evidence that formidability connotes endorsement of more conservative ideologies by demonstrating perceptions of strong men‚Äôs endorsement of liberty that could represent both social and fiscal domains (Malka et al., 2019). Namely, endorsement of liberty could reflect an interest in maintaining social rules that codify aggressive competition (social domains), whereas continued interest in competition would ensure greater access to resources without having to rely on additional rules (fiscal domains). This confluence of perceptions could reflect an understanding of formidability reflecting ‚Äúprincipled conservatism,‚Äù which emphasizes personal responsibility (for a discussion, see Reyna et al., 2006). 

It should be noted that some of our effects were relatively small in these studies. However, the consistency of these small effects could reflect the presence of a relatively subtle effect that is nonetheless interesting (Prentice & Miller, 2016). Formidability is certainly associated with perceptions of men‚Äôs interest in various aggressive bargaining tactics (e.g., Brown et al., 2022, e). However, the latent variable of conservatism is an imperfect conceptualization of ancestral social rule endorsements in a modern setting. For example, conservatism is stereotyped as being the orientation of mature adults who may be less prone to physical competition than younger adults (Richardson, 2021). Future research would benefit from identifying specific facets of conservatism that track formidability in younger members of conservative movements (e.g., First and Second Amendment). 

6.1. Limitations and future directions
Several limitations exist in this research. Our findings merely indicate the presence of a stereotype for formidable men but not whether demonstrating formidability is a veridical cue to ideology. These stimuli were not pre-tested to identify targets‚Äô affiliations. Conservatism can be accurately inferred through dominant facial features (Rule & Ambady, 2010; Samochowiec et al., 2010), although facial formidability is not associated with conservatism (Saribay & Kleisner, 2018). Future research would benefit from generating stimuli normed for both formidability and conservatism to identify whether these inferences are rooted in a kernel of truth. 

Given that facial dominance is a veridical cue of upper body strength (Holzleitner & Perrett, 2016; Sell et al., 2009) and formidable men feel more entitled to resources (Sell et al., 2012), inferences of conservatism may be possible through other bodily indices of formidability. Future research could consider concomitant features that contribute to formidability inferences beyond indices of grip strength for the stimuli in Studies 1‚Äì3. For example, previous research suggests that height and self-reported formidability are associated with endorsement of ostensibly more conservative viewpoints (e.g., Brown et al., 2021; Sell et al., 2017; Urbatsch, 2021; Richardson, 2021). Alternatively, it could be possible that these heuristic associations between conservatism and formidability track fitness-enhancing efforts from men. A noticeable portion of the variance for the association between formidability and ideology can be explained by time in the gym (Price et al., 2017). In other words, effort to increase one‚Äôs formidability could be driven by an implicit understanding of the social capital of upper body strength in men‚Äôs psychology that motivates men to increase their formidability. 

Another future direction includes identifying the cues of political affiliation in women. Although a growing body of evidence indicates women‚Äôs strength is predictive of individual differences in interpersonal bargaining strategies within certain ecologies (Kerry & Murray, 2019; von Rueden and Van Vugt, 2015), the sexual dimorphism for engaging in physical conflict and its resulting size asymmetry could limit the diagnosticity of women‚Äôs upper body strength (Palmer-Hague et al., 2018). Accurate inferences of conservatism in female faces are highest in tar gets with heightened female facial typicality connoting less formidability (Carpinella & Johnson, 2013). Attractive women‚Äôs bargaining power from femininity positions them to prefer competition (Lukaszewski, 2013). Future studies could identify which physical features deemed attractive in women (e.g., low waist-to-hip ratio) are most associated with perceptions of conservatism to determine whether attractiveness-based bargaining power heightens favorability. 

The interest in allocating status to strong men could provide impetus to consider whether the formidability preference is specific to certain coalitions. Cues to interpersonal dominance are preferred among conservative voters seeking to address outgroup threats and punish free riders (Laustsen & Petersen, 2015, 2017; Lukaszewski et al., 2016). Future research could determine the extent to which strength shapes electoral preferences. These preferences could further be shaped by ecological factors. Our use of samples in the Southeastern U.S. could reflect awareness of what men appear most effective at maintaining social policies that facilitate historically prevalent honor cultures (see Cohen & Nisbett, 1994). Future studies could consider regional differences in preferences for formidable men whom perceivers recognize as conservative while identifying which aspects of these ecologies are predictive of these preferences. 

7. Conclusion
Formidability is associated with endorsement of aggressive social bargaining strategies typifying modern conservatism. Our research identified a potential evolved psychological calculus in identifying conspecifics‚Äô ideology through physical affordance judgments through upper body strength, with formidability heightening perceptions of conservatism. Our findings represent an ancestral basis to coalitional inferences of men‚Äôs intragroup status.
","Physically formidable men are motivated to pursue strategies to acquire resources and status through direct competition and the promotion of hierarchical social organization. In service of these priorities, these men support social policies favoring the use of aggressive bargaining and hierarchy-maintenance strategies. Given these associations, we hypothesized physical strength may function as a heuristic cue of political conservatism. Participants in four unique U.S. samples assessed the political orientation of men who varied in physical strength and musculature, considering various facets of what constitutes conservatism. Physically strong men appeared more conservative to perceivers (Study 1; N = 203). Neither type of conservatism (social versus fiscal) nor presence of wealth cues moderated effects (Study 2; N = 302). Perceivers further regarded liberty as most central to strong men‚Äôs morality (Study 3; N = 179). Similar perceptions emerged for muscularity as cue to upper body strength (Study 4; N = 210). We frame results from an affordance management framework, wherein perceivers identify the potential social opportunities and costs of social targets based on physical features that inform trait inferences.","4",0,"4","Political",4,0

The Structure, Correlates, and Nature of LWA_x000D_
Authoritarianism among rightists has generally been understood to involve two broad dimensions: RWA and SDO, which reflect authoritarian submission and dominance, respectively (Duckitt & Sibley, 2007). RWA describes support for coercive social control, obsequiousness to established authorities, and conformity to traditional norms, whereas SDO describes support for hierarchy and the dominance of powerful groups over weaker groups. Other scholars have conceptualized authoritarianism as intolerance of difference and/or need for social uniformity (e.g., Feldman & Stenner, 1997). At the outset of this investigation, we did not have reason to suspect that LWA would necessarily mirror these conceptualizations due to their being tailored to right-wing populations. At the same time, we expected that LWA would dovetail with some core elements of previous conceptualizations, and in so doing, provide conceptual clarity concerning the nature of authoritarianism writ large. _x000D_
_x000D_
Our results point to the fruitfulness of a tripartite conceptualization of LWA comprising three correlated dimensions‚Äîantihierarchical aggression, top-down censorship, and anticonventionalism‚Äîthat broadly and inexactly reflect authoritarian dominance (e.g., SDO), authoritarian submission (e.g., RWA), and morally absolutist and intolerant desires for coercive forms of social organization, respectively. Antihierarchical aggression reflects motivations to forcefully overthrow the established hierarchy and punish those in power, perhaps mirroring SDO‚Äôs definitional core. Moreover, antihierarchical aggression‚Äôs nomological network was extremely similar to SDO‚Äôs nomological network, especially in the personality domain (i.e., low agreeableness, low honesty-humility, low conscientiousness, and psychopathic disinhibition and meanness), further suggesting that both constructs reflect authoritarianism‚Äôs power- and dominance-related features (Altemeyer, 1998), even as they differ in their orientation toward the established social hierarchy (i.e., challenging vs. upholding). _x000D_
_x000D_
Similarly, top-down censorship reflects motivations to wield group authority (e.g., governmental limitations on speech) as a means of regulating characteristically right-wing beliefs and behaviors, mirroring RWA‚Äôs definitional core. Fittingly, top-down censorship‚Äôs nomological network was more similar to RWA‚Äôs nomological network (i.e., low openness, cognitive rigidity, political intolerance, and dangerous worldview) than it was SDO‚Äôs. Thus, despite their manifest ideological differences, top-down censorship and RWA may similarly reflect authoritarian submission. Nevertheless, the parallels between antihierarchical aggression and SDO and top-down censorship and RWA are far from perfect. In Sample 5, for instance, antihierarchical aggression demonstrated greater similarity to both RWA and SDO than did top-down censorship, raising the possibility that antihierarchical aggression is simply a more direct analogue of rightist forms of authoritarianism than is top-down censorship. _x000D_
_x000D_
Anticonventionalism, the final LWA dimension, reflects a moral absolutism concerning progressive values and concomitant dismissal of conservatives as inherently immoral, an intolerant desire for coercively imposing left-wing beliefs and values on others, and a need for social and ideological homogeneity in one‚Äôs environment. As such, anticonventionalism does not clearly map onto authoritarian dominance or submission yet still reflects openly authoritarian sentiments and can be subsumed by the LWA construct. Consistent with this interpretation, before controlling for ideology, anticonventionalism manifested a pattern of correlations with external criteria that was not consistent with SDO or RWA, notwithstanding anticonventionalism‚Äôs large positive relations with free-speech suppression, social vigilantism, and lethal partisanship. Nevertheless, anticonventionalism‚Äôs pattern of relations was more consistent with RWA and SDO after controlling for political ideology. Moreover, in exploratory interaction analyses, anticonventionalism often potentiated the relation between antihierarchical aggression or top-down censorship, on the one hand, and outcome variables, on the other, with large effect sizes.21 These findings raise the possibility of multiplicative relations among LWA dimensions, such that LWA Index total scores are more than the sum of their parts. _x000D_
_x000D_
Thus, recognizable analogs of authoritarian dominance and submission were present in the LWA Index, situating LWA in parallel to longstanding accounts of authoritarianism on the right. By the same token, our investigation also revealed substantive differences between LWA and rightist forms of authoritarianism‚Äîmost consistently found in the anticonventionalism factor‚Äîunderscoring the need for a more expansive conception of authoritarianism (see Duckitt, 2020). Exploring the similarities and differences between LWA and RWA/SDO may offer a great deal of conceptual clarity in this regard. _x000D_
_x000D_
LWA and RWA/SDO: Similarities and Differences_x000D_
By and large, LWA and RWA/SDO seem to reflect a shared constellation of traits that might be considered the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of authoritarianism. These traits include preference for social uniformity, prejudice toward different others, willingness to wield group authority to coerce behavior, cognitive rigidity, aggression and punitiveness toward perceived enemies, outsized concern for hierarchy, and moral absolutism. Nevertheless, several notable differences between LWA and RWA/SDO also emerged. These differences can be broadly characterized as personological (i.e., variables reflecting a stable pattern of affect, cognition, and desires/motives that manifest in behavior), ideological (i.e., beliefs, attitudes, worldviews), and both personological and ideological (e.g., partisan violence). _x000D_
_x000D_
On the personological front, the most pronounced differences between LWA and RWA were negative affect (larger for LWA), confirmatory thinking (larger for RWA), and unjustified belief certainty. (larger for RWA).22 Further, RWA was more strongly related to cognitive rigidity and low openness than was LWA (prior to controlling for political ideology). This finding is consistent with the possibility that cognitive rigidity is functionally related to social conservatism in WEIRD samples (Van Hiel et al., 2016). Personological differences for LWA and SDO included coldheartedness (positive for SDO, null for LWA) and need for closure (positive for LWA, negative for SDO). Moreover, although authoritarianism has long been understood to centrally involve dispositional needs for control, certainty, and reduction of threats (either to the social order or status threats; e.g., Adorno et al., 1950; Jost, 2017; Wilson, 1973), critics of this position have observed that neither RWA nor SDO is associated with neuroticism, a personality trait characterized by the perception that the world is a dangerous place, along with the tendency to experience intense negative emotions and a sense of uncontrollability in response to stress (Barlow et al., 2014; Feldman & Huddy, 2014). LWA, in contrast, consistently predicted neuroticism in our data. This finding preliminarily suggests that left-wing authoritarians may be more sensitive to certain facets of threat and uncertainty than are right-wing authoritarians. By and large, though, LWA and RWA/SDO demonstrated far more personological similarities than differences. For instance, after controlling for political ideology, personological point estimates for LWA and RWA were within r = .05 for psychopathic meanness, cognitive reflectivity, the Dogmatism Scale, conscientiousness, need for closure, disinhibition, and psychopathic boldness. For SDO, point estimates were within r = .05 for antagonism, the DOG Scale, openness, extraversion, disinhibition, and psychoticism._x000D_
_x000D_
On the ideological front, LWA‚Äôs and RWA‚Äôs most pronounced differences were belief in science (null for LWA and negative for RWA), SVSS Conformity (negative for LWA and positive for RWA), and SVSS Self-direction (both negative, larger for RWA). For SDO, ideological differences were state control preferences (positive for LWA, null for SDO), determinism beliefs (larger for LWA), belief in science (null for LWA, negative for SDO), and belief in a dangerous world (larger for LWA). Point estimates for LWA and RWA were within r = .05 for fatalistic determinism beliefs, belief in conspiracy theories, and belief in a dangerous world. For LWA and SDO, these similarities were belief in conspiracy theories, SVSS Power, and SVSS Conformity. _x000D_
_x000D_
We also assessed several variables that capture both personological and ideological features, such as affective polarization and political intolerance. LWA and RWA were most dissimilar for partisan schadenfreude (positive for LWA, null for RWA), political social media use (positive for LWA, null for RWA), willingness to ban opposing views (larger for LWA), partisan violence (larger for LWA), and moral disengagement (larger for LWA). For SDO, the most pronounced differences were political intolerance (larger for LWA), willingness to ban public expression of opposing views (larger for LWA), partisan schadenfreude (positive for LWA, null for RWA), and moral disengagement (larger for LWA). LWA‚Äôs seemingly superior performance in this domain can likely be explained, at least in part, by the partisan skew of our samples (i.e., there were more leftists than rightists). If our samples had included more rightists than leftists, RWA and SDO would likely have been better predictors than LWA prior to controlling for ideology. _x000D_
_x000D_
What is more, political violence, a key component of folk and historical theories of authoritarianism (Wintrobe, 2006), is well-represented in the LWA Index and RWA Scale. Political violence can be directed either against the system (e.g., violent protests, terrorism) or to support the system (e.g., police brutality, support for war, state sanctioned torture of prisoners). LWA emphasizes antistate violence, whereas RWA/SDO emphasize prostate violence (Webber et al., 2020). Consistent with this possibility, LWA uniquely predicted participation in use of force for a political cause within the last five years, as well as support for, and participation in, antistate violence during the summer of 2020. The fact that antistate political violence has heretofore been largely excluded from the authoritarianism construct exemplifies the shortcomings of an exclusively right-wing account of authoritarianism. _x000D_
_x000D_
Authoritarianism and Political Ideology_x000D_
Having raised the possibility that a shared psychological core underlies different manifestations of authoritarianism, it is important to note that what authoritarianism fundamentally is, in psychological terms, remains a matter of ongoing debate (see Duckitt, 2020). Indeed, the chimerical construct has variously been conceptualized as a personality trait or disposition (e.g., Ludeke & Krueger, 2013), a rigid and absolutist style of thinking (e.g., Rokeach, 1960), an ideological attitude that satisfies discrete cognitive-motivational goals (e.g., Duckitt, 2001), and an index of political conservatism driven by needs to reduce and manage threat and uncertainty (e.g., Jost et al., 2003). These (at times) radically different conceptualizations complicate attempts to understand and discriminate between authoritarianism‚Äôs antecedents, authoritarianism‚Äôs consequents, and authoritarianism itself. Given these complexities, understanding the role that political ideology plays in measuring and conceptualizing authoritarianism represents an important avenue for future work. _x000D_
_x000D_
To understand whether and how authoritarianism and political ideology are related to one another, it should be acknowledged that various definitions of ideology have been advanced in the literature, and these are even more divergent and contradictory than those of authoritarianism (e.g., Gerring, 1997).23 Nevertheless, when psychologists have investigated political ideology, they have typically sought to understand why people are drawn to specific ideological beliefs (e.g., free-market capitalism), emphasizing the content of ideological claims (Zmigrod et al., 2020). Yet how someone holds their beliefs may be of equal or greater psychological relevance to authoritarianism than specific ideological content (Rokeach, 1960, pp. 14‚Äì15). Far-left and far-right ideologies (e.g., communism and fascism) are similarly authoritarian in their structure‚Äîboth exert powerful pressures to maintain discipline among members, advocate aggressive and censorious means of stifling opposition, believe in top-down, absolutist leadership, and so on. The content of communism, however, is arguably humanitarian and antiauthoritarian (e.g., the ideological aim is to remove economic inequities and take care of individuals per the doctrine, ‚Äúfrom each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs‚Äù). In contrast, the content of fascism is wholly authoritarian. If this is so, individuals may initially be drawn to far-left and far-right authoritarianism for different reasons (e.g., with the hopes of eliminating injustices vs. exacerbating them), even if they ultimately act in similarly authoritarian manners (Rokeach, 1960; see also Conway et al., 2020). _x000D_
_x000D_
Following this point, if authoritarianism is, indeed, a personality trait or disposition, it remains plausible that authoritarianism can be measured in a ‚ÄúPlatonic‚Äù form independent of one‚Äôs ideology. Hence, future research should attempt to tease apart LWA and RWA‚Äôs structure and content. Nevertheless, if authoritarianism is fundamentally or partially motivational, as others have argued, then measures of authoritarianism that are ideologically neutral may be of limited utility and/or not yield a coherent score. Moreover, even if LWA and RWA share many or most of their psychological substrates, left-wing ideology and right-wing ideology may interact with authoritarianism in different ways, rendering LWA and RWA both (a) more than the sum of their parts and (b) relatively unique ‚Äúflavors‚Äù of authoritarianism. Were this the case, attempting to measure authoritarianism in an ideologically neutral manner would obscure not only the unique contours of LWA and RWA but also their areas of substantive overlap. _x000D_
_x000D_
Until these competing possibilities can be resolved, it is necessary to measure and conceptualize LWA and RWA separately. For this reason, we chose to retain items in the LWA Index with leftwing content (but which were not highly correlated with ideology). In so doing, we ensured that our instrument measures authoritarianism in service of fundamentally left-wing motives and outcomes, thereby preserving future researchers‚Äô ability to compare and contrast LWA and RWA. Still, we were also quite careful to avoid creating a measure of left-wing ideology. Factors 1 and 3 of the LWA Index (as well as the measure‚Äôs total score) were consistently correlated, .45 with left-wing ideology and accounted for variance over and above ideology across dozens of criterion-related outcomes. LWA Factor 2, Anticonventionalism, tended to manifest larger correlations with ideology, but also accounted for variance in numerous criterion-related outcomes following statistical control for political ideology.24 The magnitude of these correlations is comparable with those commonly found among complementary but conceptually and empirically distinct pairs of psychological constructs, such as self-esteem and narcissism (Orth et al., 2016), shame and guilt (Paulhus et al., 2004), and affective empathy and cognitive empathy (Murphy et al., 2020). Moreover, the ACT Scale (i.e., an RWA measure with little explicit left vs. right political content; Duckitt et al., 2010) manifests correlations with political conservatism of a similar or larger magnitude than does the LWA Index (e.g., rs .60; Dunwoody & Plane, 2019). Thus, despite the presence of political content in some LWA items, the LWA Index successfully discriminates between political ideology and authoritarianism. _x000D_
_x000D_
Limitations and Future Directions_x000D_
To our knowledge, the present studies represent the most comprehensive investigation of LWA to-date. Nevertheless, we wish to delineate what can and cannot be concluded from our results. For instance, our results cannot directly speak to whether and to what extent the political right is more authoritarian than the political left, or vice versa, in part because it is unlikely that scores on the LWA Index and RWA Scale can be used and interpreted interchangeably in left- and right-wing samples. IRT scaling/ equating procedures may be useful in addressing this problem (i.e., by placing IRT parameter estimates from different test forms and populations on a common scale; Lee & Lee, 2018), although whether LWA and RWA can be distilled into a unidimensional, value-neutral authoritarianism construct remains an open empirical question. _x000D_
_x000D_
Further, the LWA Index comprises many more positively keyed items than it does negatively keyed items. This was done intentionally, because reverse-coded items frequently produce an artifactual ‚Äúkeying factor‚Äù that obscures the dimensionality of a latent construct (e.g., Netemeyer et al., 2003). Nevertheless, our nomological network analyses involving measures that also favor positivelykeyed items, such as the Personality Inventory for DSM‚Äì5 (Krueger et al., 2012), may have been distorted at least in part by shared method variance (e.g., owing to respondents who tend to respond positively to positively-keyed items, regardless of item content). Developing a relatively balanced pool of protrait and con-trait LWA items would be a worthy aim for future research. Granting this limitation, the LWA Index displayed dramatically different relations with a range of external criteria, including behavioral aggression, suggesting at least some substantive variance rising above method-covariance. _x000D_
_x000D_
An additional limitation concerns ‚Äújingle-jangle‚Äù fallacies (Block, 1995). Jingle fallacies entail the erroneous assumption that two measures with the same or similar names (e.g., Rokeach‚Äôs Dogmatism Scale and Altemeyer‚Äôs DOG Scale) reflect the same construct. In contrast, jangle fallacies entail the erroneous assumption that two measures with different names reflect different constructs. It could be argued that ‚Äúauthoritarianism‚Äù may not be an appropriate term for describing the shared core of LWA and RWA/SDO, at least insofar as authoritarianism is understood to entail deference to established authority (but see Conway et al., 2020). Future research could evaluate the psychological appropriateness of the term authoritarianism by using a version of Meehl et al.‚Äôs (1971) recaptured item technique, whereby one group of raters independently generates candidate factor names, based on a subset of items, and then a second group of raters attempts to ‚Äúrecapture‚Äù items by assigning them to their appropriate factor name, using a second subset of items. Combining measures of LWA, RWA, and SDO into a single item pool and drawing on this approach may be especially informative. Relatedly, recent evidence suggests that both left- and right-wing individuals report knowing many left-wing authoritarians (as well as right-wing authoritarians) in their everyday lives (Conway et al., 2020). Similarly, future work drawing on lexical approaches, which have been extensively used to clarify the structure and nature of personality traits and have even been adapted to the study of values (e.g., De Raad et al., 2016), may be a useful means of better understanding authoritarianism. _x000D_
_x000D_
Nevertheless, describing LWA and RWA using the same terminology without also clearly addressing the core ways they differ arguably risks blurring potentially important distinctions between them. As we have noted, communism and socialism, unlike fascism, propose humanitarian, egalitarian solutions to social injustices, which may attract individuals who hope to alleviate these injustices (Rokeach, 1960). Accordingly, left-wing authoritarians may come to believe that authoritarianism is ‚Äúa necessary evil‚Äù rather than an end unto itself. Some individuals who score highly on the LWA Index may be well-intentioned idealists seeking to build a better and a more equitable society by tearing down the establishment. Thus, any psychological similarities across LWA and RWA notwithstanding, we endorse no claims of motivational or moral equivalence (or a lack thereof) across the two constructs at present. _x000D_
_x000D_
Left-wing authoritarian ideologies may also appeal to individuals with greater cognitive complexity, because endorsing both authoritarianism and egalitarianism arguably involves reconciling two (seemingly) mutually contradictory beliefs. Indeed, embrace of contradiction is a key element of Marxist dialects (i.e., the ideological foundation of the Soviet Union and other left-wing authoritarian regimes; Hanson, 1997). Future research designed to find and clarify any differences between LWA and RWA is sorely needed to provide a more well-rounded view of the two constructs. _x000D_
_x000D_
Toward a More Comprehensive Science of Authoritarianism _x000D_
We have argued that a movement away from the conceptualization and measurement of exclusively rightist forms of authoritarianism may be required to crystalize authoritarianism‚Äôs definitional core. Having documented LWA, we now outline several additional new directions for future research in service of advancing the science of authoritarianism. _x000D_
_x000D_
One natural next step may be to construct a measure and conceptualization of authoritarianism that reflect the general properties held in common by left- and right-wing authoritarianism, drawing from the psychological commonalities revealed in the present investigation. Any such conceptualization would, in theory, apply to all positions on the ideological spectrum. Although past attempts to capture general authoritarianism have not succeeded (e.g., Rokeach, 1960), modern methods of scale development, such as those used in the present studies, may be cause for optimism. Further, the LWA Index and RWA Scale offer clear benchmarks for criterion-related validity that were not available to previous researchers. Success in this domain would offer enormous theoretical and practical advantages. For instance, a general measure could be fruitfully applied to new or yet-unstudied forms of authoritarianism, including authoritarianism in nations with politics that aren‚Äôt easily classified along the traditional left-right spectrum or authoritarianism in nonpolitical domains. _x000D_
_x000D_
Another natural progression of the present research involves exploring questions that might be more easily addressed by measuring authoritarianism in both leftist and rightist individuals. One such question concerns authoritarianism‚Äôs psychological and environmental antecedents. If the causes of RWA and LWA are highly similar, such a finding would support the hypothesis that a ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù authoritarianism underlies both constructs. In contrast, if LWA and RWA appear to stem from separate processes, such a finding would indicate that they are analogous but distinct phenomena, akin to organisms of separate species that develop functionally similar features via convergent evolution. _x000D_
_x000D_
Despite LWA‚Äôs and RWA‚Äôs marked similarities, it remains to be seen whether left-wing authoritarians who successfully overthrow the establishment tend to turn around and defend the new status-quo, thereby mirroring the right-wing authoritarians who came before them.25 Individuals high in LWA may instead tend to push back against any current power structure, even those born of revolutionary action, in which case there may be important psychological differences between LWA and RWA. Longitudinal research would be informative in this respect as it might hold the potential to arbitrate between these competing possibilities. _x000D_
_x000D_
Further, given that a third of the global population live in nations with autocratic or authoritarian governments (Repucci, 2020), yet another avenue for future research concerns exploring the diversity and complexity of the authoritarian phenomenon, which straddles sociopolitics, culture, and personality psychology, in non-WEIRD cultures, and especially in nations with authoritarian governments. Clarifying the psychology of authoritarianism among individuals who have first-hand knowledge of such systems of government, using measures explicitly tailored to their circumstances, would better allow researchers to triangulate the general properties held in common by all forms of authoritarianism. Even if LWA and RWA cannot ultimately be distilled into ‚Äúgeneral authoritarianism,‚Äù creating nuanced psychological portraits of individuals who exhibit authoritarian traits in diverse ideological and cultural contexts should provide substantial heuristic and functional value to the scientific research community and to public knowledge. _x000D_
_x000D_
Conclusions _x000D_
The dominant view of RWA as the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù of authoritarianism writ large is not merely an influential theoretical framework or a historical quirk‚Äîit limits the questions we ask as scientists, the methods we employ to answer those questions, and the types of theories we use to interpret our results. As such, the nearly universal exclusion of left-wing features from conceptualizations of authoritarianism, with little consideration of LWA‚Äôs and RWA‚Äôs psychological commonalities, has limited the kinds of knowledge we can produce as psychological scientists. Our intention in the present study has been to advance a new means of conceptualizing authoritarianism. Specifically, we have demonstrated the utility of conceptualizing and measuring leftist forms of authoritarianism, challenging longstanding portrayals of LWA as the ‚ÄúLoch Ness Monster‚Äù of political psychology. In light of authoritarianism‚Äôs enduring relevance to global politics and human behavior, we anticipate and hope that our work will allow researchers to better understand authoritarianism in all of its forms._x000D_","Authoritarianism has been the subject of scientific inquiry for nearly a century, yet the vast majority of authoritarianism research has focused on right-wing authoritarianism. In the present studies, we investigate the nature, structure, and nomological network of left-wing authoritarianism (LWA), a construct famously known as ‚Äúthe Loch Ness Monster‚Äù of political psychology. We iteratively construct a measure and data-driven conceptualization of LWA across six samples (N = 7,258) and conduct quantitative tests of LWA‚Äôs relations with more than 60 authoritarianism related variables. We find that LWA, right-wing authoritarianism, and social dominance orientation reflect a shared constellation of personality traits, cognitive features, beliefs, and motivational values that might be considered the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of authoritarianism. Relative to right-wing authoritarians, left-wing authoritarians were lower in dogmatism and cognitive rigidity, higher in negative emotionality, and expressed stronger support for a political system with substantial centralized state control. Our results also indicate that LWA powerfully predicts behavioral aggression and is strongly correlated with participation in political violence. We conclude that a movement away from exclusively right-wing conceptualizations of authoritarianism may be required to illuminate authoritarianism‚Äôs central features, conceptual breadth, and psychological appeal.","4",0,"4","Political",4,0

The ancestral logic of politics: Upper-body strength regulates men‚Äôs assertion of self-interest over economic redistribution. Psychological science, 24(7), 1098-1103.","The AWA model of animal conflict predicts that animals use advantages in fighting ability to bargain for increased access to resources. Equally, it predicts that attempts to self-interestedly increase resource shares should not be initiated when at a competitive disadvantage. The findings reported here show that this model generalizes to humans and successfully predicts the distribution of support for, and opposition to, economic redistribution in three different nations._x000D_
_x000D_
We tested a key prediction derived from animal-conflict theory: Individuals with greater fighting ability (here, upper-body strength) should seek larger shares of contested resources. We showed that upper-body strength in modern adult men influences their willingness to bargain in their own self-interest over income and wealth redistribution. These effects were replicated across cultures and, as expected, found only among males. The effects in the Danish sample were especially informative because it was a large and representative national sample._x000D_
_x000D_
These findings also offer a solution to one of social science‚Äôs key puzzles: Despite the fact that rational-choice theory is a dominant theory in social science, many empirical studies have found that self-interest has only small effects on political attitudes (Kumlin, 2007). On this basis, critics have argued that political attitudes are divorced from self-interest and are instead derived from abstract political principles (Sears & Funk, 1991; Sears, Lau, Tyler, & Allen, 1980). The present findings show, however, that the assertion of interest in mass politics is reliably calibrated by physical strength, a factor relevant to ancestral bargaining in men. It is not that self-interest is irrelevant‚Äîrather, decision-making systems for bargaining are simply designed to reflect self-interest in a cost-effective way, assuming evolutionarily recurrent small-scale social conditions._x000D_
_x000D_
Although individual differences in upper-body strength were consequential in ancestral conflicts of interest and continue to be relevant in many interpersonal disputes today, physical strength is objectively irrelevant to the personal payoffs of particular distributional schemes at the national level: National policies on issues such as economic redistribution are determined by anonymous voting, electoral representation, and the numerical power of the factions in the legislature. Furthermore, they are enforced by the state rather that by the individual. Yet our results demonstrate that physically weak males are more reluctant than physically strong males to assert their self-interest‚Äîjust as if disputes over national policies were a matter of direct physical confrontation among small numbers of individuals, rather than abstract electoral dynamics among millions._x000D_
_x000D_
It should be noted that it remains possible that individuals partially recognize the irrelevance of individual fighting ability in the domain of mass social dynamics. It may be that the weighing of physical strength in decision making negatively covaries with the number of individuals involved in a conflict, such that strength influences processing about abstract large-scale political conflict less than processing about small-scale interpersonal disputes. Future research that directly compares the influence of fighting ability on parallel decisions in small- and large-scale settings would be able to determine whether increasing the number of individuals involved down-regulates the strength effect._x000D_
_x000D_
Furthermore, the findings of this study are silent with regard to the precise proximate variables that mediate between upper-body strength and psychological traits. One candidate is testosterone, which previous research has linked to both strength (Isidori et al., 2005) and aggression (Archer, 2004). If valid, endogenous endocrine release of testosterone would be regulated by mechanisms designed to monitor upper-body muscle mass in the self and others. At the same time, it should be noted that the association in men between upper-body strength and aggression is unlikely to be just the product of testosterone, as the effects of strength on aggression are substantially greater than the established effect of testosterone on aggression (Archer, 2004; Sell, Tooby, & Cosmides, 2009)._x000D_
_x000D_
Humans are undeniably complex and unusual animals, and other more traditionally accepted factors certainly play a role in determining how individuals approach mass politics. Nevertheless, modern mass political conflict appears to be another important domain of human behavior in which decision making bears the stamp of our species‚Äô hunter-gatherer past.","Over human evolutionary history, upper-body strength has been a major component of fighting ability. Evolutionary models of animal conflict predict that actors with greater fighting ability will more actively attempt to acquire or defend resources than less formidable contestants will. Here, we applied these models to political decision making about redistribution of income and wealth among modern humans. In studies conducted in Argentina, Denmark, and the United States, men with greater upper-body strength more strongly endorsed the self-beneficial position: Among men of lower socioeconomic status (SES), strength predicted increased support for redistribution; among men of higher SES, strength predicted increased opposition to redistribution. Because personal upper-body strength is irrelevant to payoffs from economic policies in modern mass democracies, the continuing role of strength suggests that modern political decision making is shaped by an evolved psychology designed for small-scale groups.","3",1,"4","Political",4,1
17,3,"Ferguson, C. J., & Smith, S. (2023). Race, class, and criminal adjudication: Is the US criminal justice system as biased as is often assumed? A meta-analytic review. Aggression and Violent Behavior, 101905.","The issue of racial and class justice as it relates to criminal adjudication is an important one. The social contract depends on faith in the criminal justice system as a neutral arbiter. Perceptions and experiences of bias in the criminal justice system reduce public confidence and lead to social discord. In recent years it has become common belief within the scholarly community as well as the general public that the criminal justice system is biased due to race and class issues. We sought to examine this with meta-analysis. Our results suggest that for most crimes, criminal adjudication in the US is not substantially biased on race or class lines. For drug crimes there appear to be very small race differences, though confidence in these effects is reduced somewhat due to the quality of many of the studies involved. Overall, perceptions of bias in US criminal adjudications do not seem proportionate to the available evidence. This does not mean there is not potential for bias in other areas such as police treatment, arrests, or other outcomes., as our analysis is limited to adjudications.

In our research, observable effect sizes were congruent with the previous meta-analysis on studies prior to 2005 (Mitchell, 2005), which supports the conclusion that these disparities might not be as abundant as scholars previously assumed. Effect sizes in studies from 2005 on are relatively minimal. These effect sizes are about Œ≤ = 0.06, but evidence suggests that effect sizes below Œ≤ = 0.10 are indistinguishable from statistical noise. This is due to lack of precision in social science research as well as researcher expectancy effects. An earlier meta-analysis (Travis, 1998) likewise concluded that race did not determine sentencing, though methodological differences in the conceptualization of race might be a factor. We express the concern that evidence for racial bias in the US criminal justice system has been consistently weak, and that scholarly narratives have too often ignored this in favor of the systemic racism narrative.

One of the issues that appears to have led to miscommunication in this realm is that most studies of race and class disparities are conducted on massive samples, often hundreds of thousands of defendants. In such studies ‚Äúnoise‚Äù effects often become statistically significant (Ferguson & Heene, 2021). Big sample studies can actually amplify many errors, increasing Type I error rates (Kaplan et al., 2014). Scholars may not have been cautious in carefully interpreting trivially small effect sizes. This is a common issue in social science, wherein ‚Äústatistical significance‚Äù is often treated as a binary outcome with little concern for critical evaluation of effect sizes. This has been a known problem for decades (e.g., Carver, 1993), yet it persists in social science. To be fair, many studies did acknowledge that effects were small or inconsistent. Nonetheless, these words of caution do not appear to have adequately been translated to either policy makers, the general public, or scholars teaching students about criminal justice.

Our results are consistent with other data which suggests that overrepresentation among perpetrators of crime explains incarceration disparities to a greater degree than does racism in the criminal justice system (e.g., Harris et al., 2009). Policy, as such, may do better to understand the causes for disparities in the perpetration of crime. These are unlikely to relate to race per se, but rather community factors associated with poverty (Smith et al., 2022). We believe it likely that improvements in the criminal justice system may benefit from greater focus on class rather than race issues.

Our exploratory analyses did suggest some differences in outcome. Only departures, not imprisonment decisions nor sentence length crossed our evidentiary threshold and, at that, only just barely. It's possible too that departures and other discretionary issues may be more common for drug cases than other types of crime, creating some overlap in these outcomes. This possibility was partially confirmed in our analyses.

4.1. Drug crimes
Our findings for drug crimes were the one exception to our observations. Here, evidence did exceed our evidentiary standards. Nonetheless, effect sizes are still very weak, with race/ethnicity explaining only 1.3 to 2.2 % in the adjudication of drug crimes. Once again, it is both important to investigate these disparities while honestly communicating that these disparities are very small.

US penalties for drug crimes tend to be particularly severe. It may also be the case that drugs that are more commonly used by ethnic minorities (crack cocaine for instance) may be associated with harsher penalties. Thus, the issue may be less that disparities are due to any intentional racism or bias, but an unintended consequence of differential laws for different substances preferred by users of different ethnic groups. In general, we believe that a careful evaluation of draconian drug penalties would be of benefit.

4.2. Best practices/quality of studies issues
We note that methodological limitations of extant studies were significant, and likely still upwardly bias effect sizes. Most studies do control for age and prior criminal history which we regard as essential. Studies were less consistent in controlling for class if race was the main predictor variable or vice versa. Furthermore, other control variables such as attorney status (i.e., whether a public defender or private attorney was employed), employment history or presence of a cooperative victim were rarely employed. As such, more sophisticated regression models would likely be of benefit.

There are also few controls on researcher expectancy effects. This would be particularly important to consider for a research field with such obvious moral and political valence. More scholars should consider preregistration of their studies as well as making their data files openly available. This would aid in the transparency and replicability of this research field.

4.3. Citation bias issues
We note that studies with citation bias tended to produce higher effect sizes than those without. This suggests that researcher expectancy effects may have a deleterious effect on our understanding of this field and true population effects may, in fact, be smaller than what is being published in empirical studies. Efforts to use preregistration in future studies may reduce, though likely not eliminate, this effect.

4.4. Important qualifiers in the current data
Although the overall data in evidence for systemic disparities in sentencing are weaker than many may assume, the current evidence comes with several important qualifiers. First, the evidence base for class effects is very small and fairly crude. Most studies included this as a control variable for studies of race, and measures of class were often fairly rudimentary. As such, we do not believe that the evidence for potential class issues is very clear at this time. It may also be the issue that individuals of higher economic status either are not charged with crimes in the first place, or commit certain types of crimes (e.g., white collar crimes) that are less likely to see prosecution. Thus, we would like to see more and better designed studies, particularly with preregistration, that examine class in more comprehensive ways, while remaining alert to potential noise effects from large sample studies. This issue appears similar in this field as to studies of police violence wherein using proper controls can lead to better model specification (Fryer, 2016). For criminal adjudication, better measures of class, as well as other variables such as gang affiliation, lawyer quality, and such, would be worth considering in multivariate models.

Second, we observe that racial categories used in most studies are very broad (White, Black, Hispanic, etc.) and assume a homogeneity of experience within these groups that may mask differences within these groups. For instance, the experience of more recent Black immigrants from Africa or the Caribbean may not resemble those of African American descendants of slaves. Similarly, the experiences of poor, less educated Whites may differ from their highly educated counterparts. It may be helpful to examine more narrowly defined ethnic and cultural groups for specific differences.

It is also plausible that race effects may be geographically limited. For instance, on the issue of police shootings Hemenway et al. (2020) found the data to be nuanced, with White Americans more often than Black Americans shot by police in rural areas, but Black Americans shot more often by police in urban areas. It's possible that some kind of geographic specific disparities may exist that aggregate out across larger geographic areas.

With these issues in mind, there is room for scholars to bear down more specifically on this issue across smaller cultural groups and regions. Once again, preregistered designs are particularly welcome as are those alert to the potential for false positive noise effects originating from large samples.

4.5. Implications for theory
Generally speaking, evidence from this study does not support theoretical perspectives arising from racial resentment, Critical Race Theory or narratives regarding ‚Äúsystemic racism‚Äù as relates to criminal adjudication. Overall, the criminal justice system appears to be remarkably neutral, at least as relates to these issues, either when compared to the historical US criminal justice system, or criminal justice systems throughout history in other cultures.

We do call upon theorists in this area to be more explicit about falsification guidelines for such theories. Must theories do not have clear lines for falsification, which we suspect leads scholars into confirmation mode wherein weak or contradictory evidence can be interpreted as hypothesis supportive. We also suspect that negativity bias is leading scholars to interpret inconclusive evidence as hypothesis supportive as relates to the ""systemic racism"" narrative. A more robust and rigorous framework for theory testing and support would likely increase clarity in these areas.

4.6. Recommendations for the Communication of Criminal Adjudication Issues
We believe that there remain excellent reasons to advocate for many criminal justice reforms. The US incarceration rate remains uniquely high, and support for community integration of former inmates is low. Nonetheless, miscommunication of extant evidence can also do harm. At present, we believe that the evidence on racial bias in criminal justice adjudication has been poorly communicated to the general public and policymakers. In many cases, it appears that data calling into question beliefs in structural racism in the criminal justice system are simply being ignored, both by scholars in the field and by policy makers. Specifically, it is likely that many people overestimate the racial bias of the criminal justice system.

We note that this may, in part, be due to biases within the field and throughout academia. For instance, in a meta-analysis of juvenile waivers Zane et al. (2016) find no statistically significant race effect but appear reluctant to acknowledge race may have less impact than is often assumed. It has been observed that social science is liberal/progressive leaning for decades (Redding, 2001) and to the extent that progressive worldviews on race have become status-signaling in academic communities and critical evaluation of such beliefs taboo, this may result in significant miscommunication of research data to the general public. Evidence suggests that sincerely held beliefs and attitudes influence decision making in the most august circumstances where objectivity is valued (Segal & Spaeth, 1993). Generally, academics have been reluctant to examine authoritarian influences on knowledge on the political left (Costello et al., 2022), but such influences may help explain gaps between rhetoric and knowledge on issues of race.

We suggest that scholars be more cautious when covering this field, whether talking to students, policy makers or the general public. We note the possibility that overstating the case for sentencing disparities may itself cause harm to minority communities through increasing racial discord, creating fear and mistrust, and reducing community cooperation with criminal justice authorities, which may lead to the experiencing of more crime. Certainly, the US criminal justice system has a history of systemic racism. However, current evidence suggests that the criminal justice system is a much more neutral arbiter than many assume, at least on race issues. We do note that this doesn't mean this will always be the case. Just as things have shifted for the better, they could always shift again and it's critical that the criminal justice system be continually monitored for potential biases.

However, communicating to the public or students that the criminal justice system is systemically racist or classist simply isn't supported by current evidence. Miscommunicating this issue may actually lead to social discord, declines in race relations and other foreseeable negative outcomes. As such, we suggest that scholars have an ethical obligation to be cautious in their discussions of this issue.
We further offer several specific practical suggestions for researchers namely:
‚Ä¢        1) Preregistering study hypotheses, methods and analysis plan prior to data collection may cut down on false positive results.
‚Ä¢        2) Results with an effect size below Œ≤ = 0.10 (approximately OR = 1.44) should no longer be interpreted as hypothesis supportive even if ‚Äústatistically significant‚Äù (Ferguson & Heene, 2021). Results between Œ≤ = 0.10 and Œ≤ = 0.20 (approximately OR = 2.10) should be interpreted with caution as weak evidence. We observe this tendency to vastly miscommunicate weak effect sizes in related areas such as prosecutorial decisions (e.g., Wu, 2016)7 and worry such miscommunication is doing more harm than good.
‚Ä¢        3) Studies with mixed results (significance for some outcomes but not others, significance for some ethnicities but not others) should no longer be selectively interpreted as hypothesis supportive.
‚Ä¢        4) Regression models need to consider and implement further controls, whether for class, lawyer type, prior criminal history, gang affiliation, urban density, or other factors, than is often the case presently.

4.7. Limitations
As with all studies, this one has limitations that are worth considering. First, our measure of citation bias is generous and binary. In reality, citation bias likely works according to degrees‚Ä¶the study that cites a single article varying from its narrative differs from one that comprehensively and fairly covers both sides of an academic debate. It would be interesting to see further evaluations of the citation bias concept explore how ordinal systems of citation bias might influence results.

Second, further research might seek to explore the explanatory power of certain control variables such as urban density. The current analysis, relying largely on published effect sizes, is unable to quantify the impact of specific control variables, but understanding which control variables are more valuable and those which are not may help future researchers in building better specified regression models.

Third our preregistered search strategy involved using subject searches. It is possible that this may have narrowed the field of found articles somewhat, and we may have thus missed some articles with related data. However, given the generally low effect sizes found in both the current pool of data, as well as prior meta-analyses from previous decades, it is unlikely that this issue would have greatly influenced observed effect sizes.

Fourth, our analyses included only the years since Mitchell (2005). This was done so as not to overlap with prior analyses. It is possible that changes in methodology, changes in researcher expectations, or real changes in the criminal justice system could all produce differences in effect sizes that would be obscured by overlapping datasets. As it turns out, exploratory analyses suggests that effect sizes were, in fact, fairly similar across these time points. However, conducting an analysis of more recent data allowed us to more clearly come to this conclusion. Thus, the issue appears to be not that disparities have disappeared, but the evidence to suggest they exist has been much poorer than often assumed for some time.

4.8. Concluding thoughts
Concerns about the potential for race and class bias in the criminal justice system persist. Our analysis suggests that, at least in recent decades, racial and class bias in criminal adjudication may not be as distinct as once believed. With regard to most crimes, the criminal justice system seems to be effectively neutral, albeit very small effects are seen for drug crimes. In addition, nothing in our results comment on other literature's strong themes explaining disproportionate arrest rates, as may relate to differences in contact with police. Overall, this is a cause for optimism even if we must remain vigilant for negative shifts in the future. Continuing portrayals of judicial sentencing within the US as discriminatory are misleading and most likely doing more harm than good.","It is widely reported that the US criminal justice system is systematically biased in regard to criminal adjudication based on race and class. Specifically, there is concern that Black and Latino defendants as well as poorer defendants receive harsher sentences than Whites or Asians or wealthier defendants. We tested this in a meta-analytic review of 51 studies including 120 effect sizes. Several databases in psychology, criminal justice and medicine were searched for relevant articles. Overall results suggested that neither class nor race biases for criminal adjudications for either violent or property crimes could be reliably detected. For all crimes, effect sizes (in terms of r) for Black vs White comparisons were.054, for Latinos vs Whites, 0.057 and for Asians vs Whites ‚àí0.028. There was significant heterogeneity between studies, particularly for Asian vs White comparisons. Effect sizes were smaller than our evidentiary threshold, indicating they are indistinguishable from statistical noise. For drug crimes, evidentiary standards were met, although effect sizes were very small. Better quality studies were less likely to produce results supportive of disparities. Studies with citation bias produced higher effect sizes than did studies without citation bias suggesting that researcher expectancy effects may be driving some outcomes in this field, resulting in an overestimation of true effects. Taken together, these results do not support beliefs that the US criminal justice system is systemically biased at current. Negativity bias and the overinterpretation of statistically significant ‚Äúnoise‚Äù from large sample studies appear to have allowed the perception or bias to be maintained among scholars, despite a weak evidentiary base. Suggestions for improvement in this field are offered. Narratives of ‚Äúsystemic racism‚Äù as relates to the criminal justice system do not appear to be a constructive framework from which to understand this nuanced issue.","4",0,"4","Political",6,1

Clinical Psychological Science, 12(4), 751-771.","Advocates of trigger warnings claim that they help people to emotionally prepare for or completely avoid distressing material (e.g., Gust, 2016). Critics argue that warnings contribute to a culture of avoidance at odds with evidence-based treatment practices or instill fear about upcoming content (e.g., Lukianoff & Haidt, 2015). Overall, we found that trigger warnings had no meaningful effect on response affect, avoidance, or educational outcomes (i.e., comprehension). However, trigger warnings reliably increased anticipatory distress before viewing material. We now turn to a discussion of how our findings for each outcome reflect on the body of trigger-warning research to date, as well as limitations and implications for policy and therapeutic practice._x000D_
_x000D_
Response affect_x000D_
Most clinical discussion of trigger warnings has focused on response affect. Advocates assume that trigger warnings help people control or cope with their negative emotional reactions to material, whereas critics claim that warnings will only exacerbate negative reactions. Contrary to both views, we found that warnings had no effect on emotional reactions to material. That is, existing published research almost unanimously suggests that trigger warnings do not mitigate distress._x000D_
_x000D_
Why do trigger warnings fail to change emotional reactions? One explanation might be that individuals simply ignore the warnings altogether. However, this explanation is contradicted by the strong consensus, discussed later, that trigger warnings generate negative emotions during the anticipatory period. Thus, trigger warnings do initially affect emotional experience, but once presented with the actual material in question, emotional experiences equalize between those who were warned and those who were not._x000D_
_x000D_
One possibility is that most people are not skilled at emotional preparation (e.g., reappraising emotional content or using coping strategies). Thus, the uncomfortable anticipatory period is unlikely to reflect any form of helpful action. This conclusion is supported by Bridgland et al. (2022), who asked participants to explain what they would do when they came across a trigger warning; only a minority of participants mentioned some form of approach coping strategy (e.g., reappraisal strategies, such as reminding themselves to focus on nonemotional aspects of the situation; Shiota & Levenson, 2009). Indeed, trigger warnings (including those used in the current studies) typically warn people about the distressing reactions they may have but do not explain how to reduce these reactions._x000D_
_x000D_
This pattern of results is consistent with a Bayesian cognitive framework. The warning provides individuals with a weak, negative prior expectation of the content. In the anticipatory period, individuals‚Äô response closely mirrors this prior because it represents their only source of information. After exposure to the stimulus itself, participants gain complete information that makes the prior information mostly irrelevant. Indeed, this same pattern is consistent with how humans apply many biases and heuristics‚Äîthese biases are relevant in situations in which information is sparse but become irrelevant as soon as more complete information becomes available (e.g., Jussim, 2017)._x000D_
_x000D_
Avoidance_x000D_
In contrast to the claims of both advocates and critics, we found that trigger warnings did not seem to increase the avoidance of warned-of material. This fits with research showing that participants are extraordinarily unlikely to avoid distressing study stimuli. For instance, in a study by Kimble and colleagues (2021), when participants were given the option to avoid reading ‚Äútriggering‚Äù text, less than 6% took the option. Similarly, when given the option, many people deliberately and repeatedly uncover potentially distressing graphic photographs marked with a trigger warning (Bridgland et al., 2023). In fact, our results suggest that in studies in which individuals are given a direct choice between options with and without warnings, options with warnings may garner more engagement. These findings likely reflect the Pandora effect, which suggests that people have a general tendency to approach rather than avoid stimuli that has been marked aversive and uncertain (Hsee & Ruan, 2016; Oosterwijk, 2017). Furthermore, these results also raise the possibility that trigger warnings foster a forbidden-fruit effect in which warnings actually increase rather than decrease attraction to potentially negative material. In fact, the possibility that trigger warnings might increase rather than decrease attraction has already been used by advertisers to draw attention toward unhealthy food products such as fast food and alcohol (the ‚Äúteasing effect‚Äù; Ruan et al., 2018). Furthermore, there is some evidence that these types of effects are stronger among those who are most vulnerable (Bellet et al., 2020; Bridgland et al., 2023). Taken together, the current study and other research suggest that trigger warnings do not seem to be an effective method of preventing vulnerable populations from engaging with distressing stimuli._x000D_
_x000D_
Anticipatory anxiety_x000D_
We found that trigger warnings reliably increased anticipatory anxiety about upcoming content, consistent with the concerns of critics. This finding is supported by both subjective (e.g., rating scales) and objective (e.g., psychophysiological measures) markers of distress. Moreover, this finding appears to be consistent across the different trigger warning types used across studies, attesting to the robustness of this effect._x000D_
_x000D_
To reduce the disconnect between standardized effect sizes and practical implications (Otgaar et al., 2022), it may be useful to note the raw mean differences in anticipatory affect between warned and unwarned groups. First, it is necessary to establish what we might consider to be the smallest effect of interest or practical significance within this context. Anvari and Lakens (2021) asked participants to complete the PANAS twice (2‚Äì5 days apart)‚Äîat Time 2, they were asked to rate how much more/less negative/positive they felt at Time 1. For PANAS negative affect, they found that there was a mean difference of ‚àí0.11 for participants who said they felt ‚Äúthe same‚Äù as Time 1, 0.22 for participants who felt ‚Äúa little more‚Äù negative, and 0.88 for participants who felt ‚Äúmuch more‚Äù negative. In another example, studies that have used the PANAS to assess responses to highly distressing stimuli such as the trauma‚Äìfilm paradigm have found mean differences in negative affect from before to after viewing between 0.31 and 0.98 (Ehring et al., 2009; Guzey et al., 2021; Morina et al., 2013; Nagulendran et al., 2020; Stirling et al., 2023). Using Bridgland et al. (2019) and Boysen et al. (2021) as examples that also used the PANAS to measure negative affect, we can see that the mean difference in negative affect between warned and unwarned groups ranges from 0.09 (Boysen et al., 2021) to 0.14 (Bridgland et al., 2019). Therefore, we can see that seeing a trigger warning does not elicit ‚Äúmuch more‚Äù negative affect‚Äîor anything akin to viewing a trauma stimulus. However, it does appear to lead to small increases in negative affect that are not completely trivial in nature._x000D_
_x000D_
In theory, this anticipatory period could indicate that forewarned individuals are bracing themselves for a negative emotional experience. However, as discussed in the section on response affect, whatever bracing might occur during this anticipatory period is apparently completely ineffective. In other words, according to the current literature, this small increase in negative emotions induced by trigger warnings serves no productive purpose._x000D_
_x000D_
Comprehension_x000D_
Last, we found that warnings had little to no effect on the comprehension of warned material. These findings have implications for debates surrounding the potential benefits and harms of trigger warnings used in educational spaces. Advocates claim that warnings in the classroom help to foster a safe environment for trauma survivors, allowing them to prepare for distressing material and therefore enhancing their learning outcomes (DeBonis, 2019; George & Hovey, 2020). However, we found that, at best, warnings have no effect on the comprehension of material. At worst‚Äîbecause trigger warnings seem to reliably increase anticipatory anxiety responses‚Äîtrigger warnings have the potential to increase apprehension and anxiousness about attending class. Indeed, this idea is supported anecdotally in interviews with students about the use of trigger warnings in the college classroom (Bentley, 2017)._x000D_
_x000D_
Limitations_x000D_
With few exceptions, the extant work on trigger warnings uses single-timepoint designs and focuses on the short-term reactions immediately following stimuli (see Bridgland et al., 2022). It is possible that, over time, small effects accumulate and have more potent emotional consequences (Funder & Ozer, 2019). This consideration may be especially important for warnings that are becoming increasingly prevalent in everyday life across both formal (e.g., educational) and casual (e.g., entertainment) contexts. This possibility thus presents an important avenue for future research efforts. First, it would be useful to conduct a field or diary study to track the frequency of encountering trigger warnings in daily life. Second, more trigger-warning research should measure participants‚Äô emotional responses to warned-of material over more than one experimental session._x000D_
_x000D_
Although the current study provides evidence that trigger warnings are broadly inert as applied writ large, it does not provide information on whether trigger warnings have differing effects in specific subpopulations, contexts, or cultures. For example, some might argue that trigger warnings are most helpful for individuals with a past traumatic event that matches the content presented (e.g., a survivor of sexual assault reading a passage about sexual assault). Still others might contend that trigger warnings are truly helpful only for those with psychological vulnerabilities (e.g., those with more pronounced symptoms of PTSD). The current literature suggests otherwise, however. Trigger warnings do not attenuate anxiety responses, even when participants‚Äô traumatic events are similar to presented content, and may increase anxiety for those with more severe symptoms of PTSD (Jones et al., 2020). Further meta-analytic research is needed to substantiate the function of trigger warnings in psychologically vulnerable populations. Future research should also focus on the cross-cultural validation of these results to examine how these findings may or may not apply to other non-Western populations._x000D_
_x000D_
Because of their ambiguous usage, we defined trigger warnings by their intent: to help individuals prepare for or avoid content likely to trigger memories or emotions relevant to past experiences. This decision reflects the reality that trigger warnings are not a static intervention but rather a shared cultural concept that can meaningfully shift over time. The effects of trigger warnings‚Äîespecially minimal warnings (e.g., CW)‚Äîdepend on that shared cultural understanding. Thus, there may be benefits or costs of using trigger warnings that are completely detached from the original clinical motivation. For instance, trigger warnings might helpfully signal that an instructor is part of the same sociocultural clique as their students (Suk Gersen, 2021). Conversely, offering trigger warnings may signal the validity of a broader cultural narrative that is ultimately harmful (‚Äúsafetyism‚Äù; Lukianoff & Haidt, 2015)._x000D_
_x000D_
Notably, our definition of trigger-warning messages also excluded other content-warning systems such as the Motion Picture Association ratings, which are by design intended to help parents make informed viewing choices for their children and are based on age appropriacy of material (e.g., ‚ÄúPG-13: Parents are urged to be cautious. Some material may be inappropriate to pre-teenagers‚Äù; Motion Picture Association, Inc., 2023). Accordingly, available research about these labels typically focuses on parents‚Äô perceptions of the film-rating system (e.g., Longacre et al., 2009) or children‚Äôs desire to engage with material with age-restrictive labels (i.e., explorations of the forbidden-fruit effect; Gosselt et al., 2012). Although these research interests were beyond the scope of the current investigation, it is nevertheless worthwhile acknowledging the exclusion of these other related warning types as a limitation of the current review._x000D_
_x000D_
Conclusion_x000D_
Existing research on content warnings, content notes, and trigger warnings suggests that they are fruitless, although they do reliably induce a period of uncomfortable anticipation. Although many questions warrant further investigation, trigger warnings should not be used as a mental-health tool._x000D_","Trigger warnings, content warnings, or content notes are alerts about upcoming content that may contain themes related to past negative experiences. Advocates claim that warnings help people to emotionally prepare for or completely avoid distressing material. Critics argue that warnings both contribute to a culture of avoidance at odds with evidence-based treatment practices and instill fear about upcoming content. A body of psychological research has recently begun to empirically investigate these claims. We present the results of a meta-analysis of all empirical studies on the effects of these warnings. Overall, we found that warnings had no effect on affective responses to negative material or on educational outcomes. However, warnings reliably increased anticipatory affect. Findings on avoidance were mixed, suggesting either that warnings have no effect on engagement with material or that they increased engagement with negative material under specific circumstances. Limitations and implications for policy and therapeutic practice are discussed.","5",0,"5","Political",4,0

Humor, 34(3), 375-391.","The results of this study suggest that the tendency to appreciate stereotypical jokes perceived as targeting high- versus low-status groups is associated with individual differences in system justification. Specifically, we obtained consistent evidence that high system-justifiers found jokes disparaging low-status groups such as women, poor people, African Americans, Muslims, and Mexicans to be funnier than did low system-justifiers. To a much lesser extent, we also observed‚Äîin at least a few cases‚Äîthat low system-justifiers were more likely than high system-justifiers to appreciate jokes targeting high-status groups such as European Americans and rich people._x000D_
_x000D_
Interpreting these results through the lens of benign violation theory, we propose that high and low system-justifiers are likely to differ in terms of which violations of normative expectations are considered to be ‚Äúbenign.‚Äù Although we did not measure perceptions of benevolence, our findings are consistent with the notion that high system-justifiers found jokes disparaging low-status groups to be less harmful than did low system-justifiers. Future research would do well to measure directly the perceived the harmfulness of jokes disparaging high- versus low-status group members._x000D_
_x000D_
These findings comport with other demonstrations that specific types of humor appreciation may be linked to relatively stable ideological dispositions. Much as previous studies highlighted the role of individual differences in hostile sexism (Ford et al. 2001, 2008; Prusaczyk and Hodson 2020), right-wing authoritarianism (Hodson et al. 2010a), and social dominance orientation (Hodson et al. 2010b) when it comes to the appreciation of sexist and racist humor, the present investigation suggests that system justification plays a role in shaping reactions to jokes targeting a variety of high- and low-status groups. Thus, the results we have obtained are consistent with the notion that group-based humor can serve to legitimize the social standing of some social groups while delegitimizing others, as proposed by Hodson and MacInnis (2016)._x000D_
_x000D_
There are several advantages and disadvantages associated with the methodology we adopted that should be taken into account when evaluating findings and interpretations. Although most studies in this research area have focused on responses to just one or two humorous statements‚Äîoften one-liners‚Äîtargeting a single racial or gender group, we presented research participants with 37 different jokes targeting a wide variety of high- and low-status groups. Many of the jokes, which were told by a number of mainstream comedians, were relatively complex and operated at multiple levels of interpretation. This means that our study was reasonably strong in terms of external validity, because we exposed people to precisely the type of stereotypical humor they are likely to encounter in American popular culture. Another advantage of our research program is that we presented people with jokes disparaging high-status as well as low-status groups. To our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on the role of ideology in responding to jokes targeting those who are advantaged versus disadvantaged in society._x000D_
_x000D_
At the same time, this methodical decision introduced certain ambiguities of joke interpretation. In nearly one-third of the cases, participants disagreed about which group was in fact the butt of the joke. We found that how one interpreted the joke was associated with humor appreciation as a function of one‚Äôs level of system justification: high system-justifiers were more likely to find jokes funny when they perceived the joke as targeting low-status groups, whereas low system-justifiers were more likely to find jokes funny when they perceived them as targeting high-status groups. Another limitation of our study is that participants were not asked explicitly about which groups they considered to be high and low in social status. It is possible that some respondents perceived a given target group as higher (or lower) in status than other respondents, but it is doubtful‚Äîgiven the degree of consensus that surrounds most cultural stereotypes (Jost and Banaji 1994)‚Äîthat our classifications of high and low-status groups in American society would have been rejected by many participants (see supplemental material for group classifications)._x000D_
_x000D_
Furthermore, we acknowledge that our sample was limited in terms of demographic and ideological diversity. In general, MTurk samples are more statistically representative of the national population than other types of convenience samples‚Äîsuch as college students‚Äîfrequently used in psychological research. Still, nearly 80% of our respondents were European Americans. No doubt this constrains the generalizability of the findings, especially given that people respond differently to jokes targeting their own versus other social groups (Hodson et al. 2010b). Future studies aimed at understanding the role of system justification processes in humor appreciation would do well to make use of larger and more diverse samples to consider higher order interaction effects involving the group membership of the receiver and that of the joke-teller as well._x000D_
_x000D_
5 Concluding remarks_x000D_
Despite a number of weaknesses, the present study opens the door to a wide range of potential contributions moving forward. It would be especially useful to explore the multiple, possibly conflicting ways in which stereotypic humor encourages people to turn a blind eye toward social injustice and inequality in society while, at the same time, relying upon an implicit recognition of injustice or inequality. For instance, Dave Chappelle‚Äôs joke about the dramatic contrast in socio-economic environments and quality of life that one encounters when crossing the Bay Bridge from San Francisco to Oakland depends upon the audience members‚Äô acknowledgment of harsh realities, even as he appears to make light of them:_x000D_

And I always admired San-Fran for that and today I realize how you did it. Put all the n****rs on the other side of that bridge. There‚Äôs nothing ‚Ä¶ shit ain‚Äôt happy on that side.

_x000D_
If participants laugh at the joke, they are in some way adopting a critical ideological stance toward society, even as they find congenial ways of tolerating, if not altogether excusing, vast inequality._x000D_
_x000D_
Thus, a promising direction for future research would be to first expose people to various types of humorous messages and then measure their subsequent levels of system justification, perhaps indirectly or unobtrusively. It seems likely that some jokes‚Äîespecially those that reinforce victim-blaming myths in which members of disadvantaged groups are mocked and made to seem responsible for their plight‚Äîwould increase at least some respondents‚Äô sense that inequality in society is fair, legitimate, and desirable. Other jokes‚Äîsuch as those that draw attention to illegitimate features of our social, economic, and political systems‚Äîmight have the opposite effect, reducing system justification tendencies, at least temporarily. Because of the ostensibly benign nature of many humorous interventions, jokes that criticize mainstream society may, in a sense, fly ‚Äúunder the radar‚Äù and may therefore be less likely to trigger system-defensive backlash. In this sense, the subversive potential of humor is great, for it can, at least in principle, be used to undermine ideological support for the status quo, much as it is used so often by self-conscious enemies of ‚Äúpolitical correctness‚Äù to bolster existing inequalities._x000D_","Many popular comedians tell complicated jokes that involve multiple levels of interpretation. The same joke may be perceived as criticizing or reinforcing the societal status quo, depending on perceivers‚Äô assumptions about the target of the punchline (e.g., whether the joke is at the expense of high- or low-status groups). We focused on how such jokes are experienced by listeners who are psychologically prone to justifying (vs. challenging) the status quo. In a sample of Mechanical Turk workers (N = 179), we explored whether individual differences in system justification would be associated with the appreciation of group-based (stereotypical) humor, depending on the perceived target of the joke. As hypothesized, high system-justifiers found jokes targeting low-status groups (e.g., women, poor people, racial/ethnic minorities) to be funnier than low system-justifiers did. In some cases, low system-justifiers found jokes targeting high-status groups (rich people, European Americans) to be funnier than high system-justifiers did. These results expand upon previous demonstrations that humor appreciation is linked to relatively stable ideological dispositions and suggest that different individuals may perceive complex group-based humor in divergent ways.","1",0,"1","Political",3,1

Journal of Academic Ethics, 1-16.","Results in both studies provide continued evidence for considerable unpopularity of retractions due to information hazards, relative to more conventional reasons for retraction. This suggests that participants viewed retraction primarily as a tool to preserve an accurate scientific record while mostly viewing retraction due to information hazards as relatively inappropriate (see Namuth et al., 2023). This general understanding of the intentions of retraction across different samples suggests a consensus between a segment of the public, specifically university students, and those involved in scientific research on when retraction is most appropriate (Edlund et al., 2022). Those involved in science could harness this information as a means of fostering dialog with the public and prevent further erosion of public trust (Contessa, 2022). Such initiatives could further develop a more institutional understanding of retraction across different sectors of society that would buffer scientific research from the nonscientific underpinnings of many attacks against perceived hazards in the dissemination controversial findings that are unlikely to present actual dangers (Clark et al., 2023a; Kennedy et al., 2022)._x000D_
_x000D_
Unsurprisingly, students demonstrated greater receptivity toward retractions based on information hazards (i.e., MStudent=4.07 versus MResearcher=2.62). This receptivity could reflect a less awareness of the implications of this form of retraction for objective scientific inquiry, or a greater belief that moral concerns constitute a legitimate reason for retraction. Conversely, researchers may view similar reasons for retraction as less appropriate due to what could represent a subversion of the scientific process that values critical debate and evidence (Resnik & Stewart, 2012). Thus, lay individuals and scientists differentially consider the roles of moral and scientific values as impetuses behind retraction._x000D_
_x000D_
Opportunities for educational modules could exist for lay individuals to develop an understanding of the scientific method, research, and retractions, and perhaps see benefits of placing greater emphasis on scientific relative to moral values when evaluating scientific findings. More formal training modules for undergraduate and graduate students could focus on the recognition of one‚Äôs potential biases that promotes an interest in limiting retraction for these instances. Increased understanding for the utility of retraction could have a downstream consequence of ameliorating pervasive concerns on university campuses about self-censorship to prevent sanctions (Ekins, 2017; Vogels et al., 2021). This could be facilitated by broader discussion of how moral biases, or distortions created by self-interest, can affect strategic decision-making to help people better understand when they are being guided by objective principles versus personal preferences (Croson & Konow, 2009)._x000D_
_x000D_
Researchers‚Äô engagement in activism was not predictive of their receptivity toward retraction. This lack of association is further evidence for how extensive scientific training can effectively reduce an interest in dubious reasons for retraction. However, high-risk activism engagement predicted greater support for retractions based on information hazards among male students. Men‚Äôs dispositional proclivity toward risk-taking could influence them to take more hardline social or political stances against information hazards that could serve to demonstrate their coalitional value (Fessler et al., 2014). Specifically, men are more motivated by ascending status hierarchies than women (e.g., Van Vugt & Tybur, 2015), which often requires them to engage in riskier behaviors to ensure their continued access to resources while signaling to group members their ability to incur potential costs of these risks. Thus, men‚Äôs motivation for high-risk social activism may be partially guided by status motives, which could manifest in greater support for information hazard-based retraction. Given that information hazard retraction is not primarily guided by scientific objectivity, supporting it could represent risky behavior as it could ultimately jeopardize one‚Äôs status in their scientific discipline._x000D_
_x000D_
Women are more receptive in both samples toward information hazard as the basis of retractions. This finding could reflect the centrality of harm reduction in women‚Äôs morality that could elicit greater conflict between personal and institutional values (Armstrong et al., 2019). Alternatively, women‚Äôs responses could reflect a greater risk aversion within the peer review process, given the generally heightened judiciousness of female researchers in the peer review process (Namuth et al., 2023). Future research would benefit from identifying motivational underpinnings of men and women‚Äôs decisions._x000D_
_x000D_
Limitations and Future Directions_x000D_
Several limitations emerged in the current research that warrant further studies. First, although we were deliberate in our sampling method to compare students to active research scientists, the latter sample was ultimately skewed toward a left-leaning ideology and the former heavily female. Despite the overall weariness toward retraction among individuals within these demographic categories toward information hazards (Namuth et al., 2023), the ostensibly more salient conflict between personal and institutional values could impede a fuller scope of understanding how a gender-balanced sample scientists may respond to these scenarios across the political spectrum. The predominantly left-leaning nature of large swaths of the academy could present a difficult task for future research (Honeycutt & Freberg, 2017; Honeycutt & Jussim, 2022; Inbar & Lammers, 2012). Nonetheless, the relative consistency between these findings and previous work leads us to have a measure of confidence in our results._x000D_
_x000D_
The scalar nature of our outcome variables presents a further limitation to our results‚Äô potential ecological validity. Future work could require participants to decide whether to retract a paper based on the provided scenario using an ipsative response (i.e., reject versus not reject). It could be possible that individuals are willing to support retractions due to information hazards if required to make the decision themselves. Individuals could signal their moral values specifically in the service of mitigating sanctions from other academics due to their association with a decision not to retract controversial research (see Jussim, 2022). Conversely, researchers could be hesitant toward retraction with a discrete decision when a scalar response could provide a degree of absolution from their participation in potential dubious editorial decisions._x000D_
_x000D_
Related to the above point, it is unlikely that our classification system captures all factors that underlie retraction, nor are other classification potentially less defensible. However, we note emerging empirical consistency across this factor structure (see Namuth et al., 2023) that can provide a reliable impetus for growth in this area of inquiry. It should also be noted that the task for participants in our study may not be a perfect analog for actual retraction contexts. For example, it is often the case that a paper meets standards for publication from a journal and has been vetted by an editor and multiple reviewers. However, backlash regarding the findings may result in post hoc cherry-picking of ‚Äúobjective‚Äù objections to justify retraction (Bailey, 2023, Savolainen, 2023). Because even ethical peer-review has a level of ambiguity (e.g., different reviewers differentially evaluate a manuscript‚Äôs suitability for publication), the ambiguity to couch information-hazard reasons for retraction in concerns compromised research rigor is not something our work can address. Rather, we find that when participants are given clear, specific reasons for retraction, they differentially valuate those reasons largely consistent with the tenets of scientific objectivity. Nonetheless, we suspect this can play out differently in real research settings._x000D_
_x000D_
Formally trained scientists had an especially tempered interest in retraction based on information hazards. Future work could include discussions of information hazard as a reason for retraction and the implications of such support in existing ethics training or develop self-contained ethics modules on this topic with the goal of best ensuring retraction decisions are guided by objection that are themselves based on objectivity. Indeed, such interventions have demonstrated long-term efficacy in heightening in graduate students, which could suggest a degree of efficacy in training scientists (Sacco & Brown, 2019)._x000D_
_x000D_
Conclusion_x000D_
The increasing conflict between various sets of values in the scientific endeavor necessitates an ongoing conversation on how to ensure the purpose of research is not undermined by unscientific influences. These data suggest that members of the scientific community have a degree of resistance to these pressures, which could be fostered through rigorous training. We suggest that science would benefit from further engagement with the public on the purpose of retraction and thus improve the prospects of the field._x000D_","Retractions have traditionally been reserved for correcting the scientific record and discouraging research misconduct. Nonetheless, the potential for actual societal harm resulting from accurately reported published scientific findings, so-called information hazards, has been the subject of several recent article retractions. As these instances increase, the extent of support for such decisions among the scientific community and lay public remains unclear. Undergraduates (Study 1) and federally funded researchers (Study 2) reported their support for retraction decisions described as due to misconduct, honest errors, or potential information hazards. Participants supported retraction on the former two grounds more than the latter. Despite limited support, women remained more receptive to retractions based on information hazards. Activist tendencies additionally predicted undergraduate men‚Äôs receptivity. Receptivity toward retraction due to information hazards was unrelated to scientists‚Äô engagement in activism, suggesting that formal scientific training affords researchers an ability to separate personal and professional values in scientific discourse. Findings could inform the development of educational materials that may aid less experienced scientists and the lay public in understanding retraction ethics.","4",0,"4","Political",5,1
21,4,"Erev, I., Plonsky, O., & Roth, Y. (2020). Complacency, panic, and the value of gentle rule enforcement in addressing pandemics. Nature Human Behaviour, 4(11), 1095-1097.","In many natural settings, panic or reckless behaviour by some individuals increase the incentives of others to exhibit similar behaviours. For example, observing grocery stockpiling by others leads people to worry about the availability of grocery products in the near future. Consequently, they will engage in what appears to be panic shopping as well. Similarly, reckless behaviour of others in one‚Äôs geographical vicinity or social group can lead to lockdowns in one‚Äôs location or to stereotypical treatment of all individuals in one‚Äôs group, reducing the benefits from adherence to the guidelines. Therefore, the existence of a minority of individuals who panic (or who are reckless) can make it more attractive for the majority to panic (or behave recklessly) as well. Such behavioural contagion has been well studied and validated in many other situations8,9,10,11. Additionally, it can be computationally shown to emerge in settings like those described in Fig. 1, even when some individuals in the population rely on large samples or are rational decision-makers._x000D_
_x000D_
The potential of gentle rule enforcement_x000D_
Our discussion above suggests that people may not naturally demonstrate optimal behaviours towards a pandemic, even if it is in their best interest to do so. Authoritarian governments may choose to enforce responsible behaviours. One example of such enforcement comes from a policy, implemented in China, to harshly enforce use of smartphone contact tracing applications to control the spread of COVID-19. People had to use the recommended applications (and display a green signal on the application‚Äôs screen) to enter stores and public facilities or to travel12. This policy helped break chains of transmission; when a user of the application was found to carry the virus, it was easy to identify users with whom the user recently interacted and isolate them to prevent secondary transmissions. Notice that the harsh enforcement solution can be abstracted as a modification of the Reckless or Responsible task described above, in which the utility from Reckless is vastly reduced._x000D_
_x000D_
Although harsh enforcement policies of this kind can be very effective, they violate the rights of individuals and are incompatible with democratic principles. Our analysis suggests that it may be possible to design policies that are effective with more gentle enforcement that respects the rights of individuals13,14,15. To see why gentle rule enforcement policies can work, note that if people rely on small samples, they will not be sufficiently sensitive to rare (low probability) risks and instead will tend to base their decisions mostly on the common (high probability) experiences. For example, in the original Reckless or Responsible task, individuals that rely on small samples tend to behave recklessly because the common outcome from being Reckless (+10) is better than the common outcome from being Responsible (+5), and most small samples include only these common outcomes (and no rare events). Thus, a gentle reduction of the common experience from reckless behaviour may be sufficient to eliminate the tendency to behave recklessly._x000D_
_x000D_
One way in which gentle rule enforcement can be implemented in natural settings involves interventions ensuring that, in most experiences, the responsible behaviour saves time and/or minimizes effort. In one demonstration of the value of this method, foremen in 11 Israeli factories were asked to encourage the use of safety devices by simply telling workers who did not use them to cease their current work and bring the missing safety devices. This gentle but frequent enforcement mechanism replaced a harsh one in which large fines were occasionally administered by the factories‚Äô safety inspectors. The results revealed a quick decrease, from 50% to 10%, in safety rule violations15. Similar approaches could be implemented in the context of a pandemic. For example, to encourage the use of contact tracing applications, it may be enough to ask individuals that do not want to use the applications to fill longer forms and go through longer checks upon entry to public facilities. The effectiveness of gentle enforcement of the use of tracing applications is likely to also depend, of course, on the quality of the applications. Maximal effectiveness is expected when the application‚Äôs false alarm rate is low and when the application is designed to respect individuals‚Äô privacy. Yet, insofar as these design aspects of the app do not contribute to the common outcomes of the decision to use or not use the application (i.e., if they only change the outcomes infrequently), their impact on these decisions may be smaller than one would expect._x000D_
_x000D_
The analysis of human reactions to experience leads to one discouraging and one encouraging prediction concerning the spread of pandemics. The discouraging prediction is that, without enforcement, many people may not behave optimally in response to the threat of a pandemic. The encouraging prediction is that enforcement does not have to be harsh: gentle reduction of the attractiveness of suboptimal behaviours can suffice._x000D_","The impact of pandemics is magnified by the coexistence of two contradicting reactions to rare dire risks: panic and the ‚Äòit won‚Äôt happen to me‚Äô effect that hastens spread of the disease. We review research that clarifies the conditions that trigger the two biases, and we highlight the potential of gentle rule enforcement policies that can address these problematic conditions.","4",0,"4","Political",4,0
22,4,"Erev, I., Gilboa Freedman, G., & Roth, Y. (2019). The impact of rewarding medium effort and the role of sample size. Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, 32(5), 507-520.","Bounded reward policy games are defined here as situations in which policy makers cannot reward the behavior they desire most and must decide if they want to reward a different behavior instead. Our analysis focuses on situations in which policy makers want to promote investment of High effort, but can only reward Medium effort. The theoretical part of the analysis shows that the impact of rewarding Medium effort is highly sensitive to an interaction between the probability of regret, on the one hand, and the amount of evidence used by agents to inform their decisions on the other. When Low effort maximizes average regret (i.e., impairs the agent's EV) but minimizes the probability of regret (i.e., is the better choice most of the time), as in the reckless shortcut game, the value of rewarding Medium effort decreases with the sample size; rewarding Medium effort is expected to be effective if agents rely on small samples, but counterproductive if they rely on large samples. In contrast, when Low effort minimizes average regret (maximizes the agent's EV) but maximizes the probability of regret, as in the treasure hunt shortcut game, the value of rewarding Medium effort increases with the sample size. In this case, rewarding Medium effort is expected to be effective if the agents rely on large samples, but counterproductive if they rely on small samples._x000D_
_x000D_
Our experimental studies show that participants behave as if they rely on small samples even when they can rely on large samples. This pattern was documented in repeated-choice tasks when subjects had to base their decision on their personal experience (Experiments 1 and 2), and is intensified when subjects rely on the experience of other agents (Experiment 3). Thus, the current analysis suggests that rewarding Medium effort is effective in situations that resemble the reckless shortcut game, but counterproductive in situations that resemble the treasure-hunt shortcut game._x000D_
_x000D_
6.1 Reliance on small samples_x000D_
The task used in the current experiment differs from natural settings in many ways. Nevertheless, we believe that the hypothesis that drives the current results, namely, reliance on small samples, is likely to hold in many natural settings._x000D_
_x000D_
Our belief rests on the observation that there are at least three factors which lead people to rely on small samples when making decisions. The best-known factor is laziness‚Äîpeople tend to collect a limited number of observations (Hertwig et al., 2004). This factor is likely to be important in low-stakes decisions, such as answering questions in an e-learning tool, but less important when the stakes are high._x000D_
_x000D_
The other two factors‚Äîobjective constraints and changing environments are likely to be more important in natural high-stakes decisions than in our experiments. The clearest contributor to reliance on small samples in high-stakes contexts such as career decisions is objective constraints. In such situations, the set of relevant experiences available to decision makers is small. Most workers do not have a long personal history of job hunting while employed in a given workplace, and although they can learn from the experiences of other agents, only a small fraction of those experiences are likely to be similar to the choice task of the acting agent. Moreover, as demonstrated in our analysis of the reckless shortcut game, in certain settings, most decision makers are predicted to deviate from maximization in the direction of the reliance on small sample hypothesis even when they follow the fictitious play rule based on hundreds of observations._x000D_
_x000D_
The third contributor to reliance on small samples is a belief‚Äîoften justified‚Äîthat the environment in which the decision must be made is dynamic. For example, when the state of nature is determined by an unknown Markov chain, sophisticated agents can approximate the decisions of a fully informed Bayesian decision maker (who is aware of the underlying chain and behaves in accordance with Bayes' theorem) by guessing the current state based on the sequence of recent outcomes. Such agents can then choose the action that led to the best outcomes in the small set of past experiences in that state (see Plonsky et al., 2015). Thus, reliance on small samples does not have to be a reflection of bounded rationality; it can be a reflection of sophisticated contingent analysis._x000D_
_x000D_
6.2 Learning from the experience of others_x000D_
The current results highlight two differences between decisions based on personal experience and based on the experience of others. The first involves a distinct recency pattern. The results suggest a wavy recency effect in decisions based on personal experience and an initial negative recency effect in decisions based on personal experience. This difference can be captured with the hypothesis that people tend to select the option that led to the best average payoff in a small set of similar past experiences, and the identity of the decision maker (me or others) affects the underlying similarity function._x000D_
_x000D_
The second difference involves the sample size that best fits the data. We must admit to being surprised by the finding that presenting agents with the experience of other agents intensifies the tendency to rely on small samples (reducing the sample size that best fit the data under the na√Øve sampler model). Indeed, we noticed this pattern only after being asked to consider it by a careful reviewer. Intuitively, it seems natural to assume that decisions based on observing the outcomes of others should be similar to decisions based on descriptions of the payoff distributions (as in Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), and should increase the weighting of rare events. This reasonable assumption is violated by the current data. One explanation of this result is based on an extension of the contingent analysis idea discussed above. The tendency to rely on small samples reflects, under this view, an effort to base choice behavior on the most similar past experiences (Hertwig & Erev, 2009; Plonsky et al., 2015). If the experience of others is regarded as less similar to the current choice task, this hypothesis implies that presenting the experiences of others should reduce the size of the samples used to inform choice behavior._x000D_
_x000D_
Yet there are at least three other reasonable alternative explanations for the more extreme results observed in Experiment 3. First, only in Experiment 3 could the participants see the choices made by other agents. Thus, part of the effect found there may reflect imitation. Second, the difference may reflect an order effect: Only in Experiment 3 did the participants face both games. Finally, because we did not predict this effect in advance and we cannot present a clean test of its significance, it is possible that it reflects the effect of chance. It is clear that this unpredicted pattern should be treated with caution until it is validated in future research._x000D_
_x000D_
6.3 Hospital hygiene and doctors' accessibility_x000D_
In order to clarify the practical implications of the current analysis it is convenient to return to the two hospital examples. As noted above, the ‚Äúhospital hygiene‚Äù example involves a reckless shortcut game. Our analysis predicts insufficient sensitivity to the rare risk of infection, and for that reason, the net effect of reinforcing medium effort (e.g., rewarding wearing gloves even without careful hand washing) is expected to be positive: Increasing the rate of medium effort and reducing the rate of low effort. Erev, Rodensky, Levi, Englard-Hershler, et al. (2010) present an intervention study that supports this prediction._x000D_
_x000D_
In contrast, the current ‚Äúdoctors' accessibility‚Äù example reflects a rare treasure shortcut game and our analysis predicts a negative effect of rewarding medium effort. Specifically, policies that reinforce doctors for distributing their private phone numbers (the medium effort shortcut in this example) are predicted to backfire: Their main impact will be to reduce high effort and increase the popularity of medium effort shortcut._x000D_
_x000D_
6.4 Populism, wider implications, and conclusions_x000D_
Notice that the implications of the current analysis to the hospital examples sound counterintuitive. It seems natural to assume that in contradiction to the current recommendations, patients are likely to prefer hospitals that encourage doctors to carefully wash their hands and share their private phone numbers. This contradiction between the implications of the reliance on small sample hypothesis and the common intuition is not unique to the current analysis. When people carefully think about a specific problem they tend to focus on the rare events, whereas the reliance on small samples hypothesis suggests that the actual behavior will exhibit the opposite pattern. In other words, the policies recommended here are not likely to be popular, but this fact does not imply that they will not be effective._x000D_
_x000D_
To further clarify this gap between the current analysis and the popular views we chose to conclude by discussing a (regretfully) topical decision: Whether to join a criminal or terrorist network. For people who hate their life in normative society, such organizations can provide a sense of value and belonging (Borum, 2011). Assuming that this is the most common outcome of joining such a network, it will tend to be reinforcing. Yet this choice also carries a high risk, as seen in the fate of potential ISIS recruits killed while trying to reach ISIS territory (e.g., De Peyer, 2017). Under these assumptions, joining an illegal organization is an example of a reckless shortcut game, and forgiveness for people who consider this option but then reject it is likely to be effective. A sexier example of a reckless shortcut game involves activities that can facilitate adultery._x000D_
_x000D_
We believe that the Talmud's statement, ‚ÄúIn a place in which repentant sinners stand, completely righteous people cannot stand,‚Äù focuses on similar reckless resign games. In the eyes of the Talmud, these sinners are likely to have been people who toyed with rejecting their religion and community. Such an act can even today involve high risk, even when most ‚Äúsins‚Äù are reinforcing. Thus, in this context, rewarding repentance is wise under our analysis too._x000D_
","We take the point-of-view of designers of incentive systems who cannot reward the behavior they most desire, and must decide whether to reward a less desired behavior. For example, when it is difficult to distinguish between the desired high-effort strategy from a low-effort ‚Äúmimicry‚Äù strategy, policy makers may choose instead to reward medium levels of effort. Experiments 1 and 2 examine situations in which participants (the subjects of the policy) base their decisions on personal experience obtained in 100 choices with immediate feedback. The results show that rewarding medium levels of effort is effective in ""reckless shortcut"" settings (where a low-effort strategy impairs participants' expected return but provides the best payoff in most cases), and is counterproductive in ""treasure-hunt shortcut"" settings (where a low-effort strategy maximizes the expected return, but provides the worst payoff in most cases). Experiment 3 suggests that this pattern is intensified when participants base their decisions on the experience of other agents. The aggregate choice rates can be captured with a two-stage na√Øve sampler model that assumes reliance on small samples of past experiences, and a decrease in the sample size when learning from the experience of others. Importantly, the descriptive value of the reliance on small samples hypothesis is not a result of a tendency to rely on the most recent experiences. These findings can be explained by assuming that people rely on those experiences, which seem most similar to the current task, and that the experiences of others seem less similar.","2",0,"2","Political",4,0

One of the characteristics of written Hebrew is its inconsistency in the use of vowel letters (known as matres lectionis). Words can be spelled without vowel letters (""defective spelling""), with them (""full spelling""), or in some mixture thereof. The earliest known Hebrew inscriptions, dating from the tenth century BC, use defective spelling almost exclusively. However, all versions of all books of the Hebrew Bible known to us today employ a complex mixture of full and defective spelling, not even consistently for the same words. The Babylonian Talmud (Kiddushin 30a), written around the fourth century AD, reports that full knowledge of the original spellings had by that time been lost. This evidence, and much other evidence, has led most scholars to believe that either one or more major revisions, or a long gradual process of slow revision, produced major changes in the letter-by-letter text between the original and the first historic editions (Cross and Freedman, 1952; Naveh, 1987; Zevit, 1980). _x000D_

The Dead Sea Scrolls date from the third century BC to the first century AD. There are many scrolls of Genesis among them, but they have survived only in small fragments. The rate of variation between the surviving fragments and the present text varies from about 1 letter in 1200 to about 1 letter in 20 (Tov, 1998; Ulrich et al., 1994). Because of the wide range of textual variants and for other reasons, the general consensus among experts is that the scrolls are representative of the textual situation throughout Palestine at the time (Cohen, 1998; Tov, 1992). The amount of variation that had already occurred during the many preceding centuries since Genesis was written is a matter of scholarly speculation, though the considerations of the previous paragraph suggest it was very great. _x000D_

Around the eighth to tenth centuries, there was a major process of standardization leading to the so-called Masoretic text, which displaced most other extant editions within the next few hundred years. Still, despite the exercise of very great care, the difficulty of exact copying by hand is so great that we do not have two identical scrolls from before the advent of printed editions in the sixteenth century. Differences between scrolls could amount to anything from a few letters to thousands of letters. _x000D_

In summary, there is hardly any chance that the Koren edition is close in letter-by-letter detail to the original text. In fact, if the text of Genesis were to be consistently spelled in the style of the inscriptions dated closest to the traditional year when Genesis was written, the differences would number in the thousands (even without any change of meaning). This conclusion has catastrophic consequences for any theory that ""codes"" in the original text have survived until today. Clearly an ELS is destroyed if any letter is inserted or deleted within its overall span. The ELSs giving the strongest contribution to the WRR94 result together span most of the text. Our experiments show that deletion of 10 letters in random places is enough to degrade the result by an average factor of 4000, and deleting 50 letters is enough to eliminate it completely. Of course, the effect has a very large variance, as it depends on which of a comparatively small number of important ELSs are ""hit"" by a deletion. The first list is even more sensitive to the effects of such corruption, as its important ELSs have greater skip. Ten letters deleted in random places are on average enough to eliminate its significance altogether. _x000D_
_x000D_
To further explore the effect of textual corruption, we performed WRR's experiment on a number of other exemplary Genesis texts, prepared for us by Jeffrey Tigay (Professor of Hebrew and Semitic Languages and Literatures at the University of Pennsylvania) using information provided by Menachem Cohen. These include the Yemenite edition, which is probably the best single representative we have today of the Masoretic text of Genesis, and the Leningrad Codex, which is the oldest complete text of the Hebrew Bible still in existence. For each text, Table 4 gives the number of letters by which it differs from the Koren edition (see Cohen, 1997a, for details) and the best permutation rank out of P1l4. Because it is believed by experts (Breuer, 1976; Cohen, 1997b) that the Yemenite edition is more likely to be correct than the Koren edition in each of the three places where they differ, we also show the effect of each of those differences separately. The rows labelled Koren-1 to Koren-3 show the Koren text with each of the three single changes applied. _x000D_
_x000D_
We can see that the Koren edition, the one used by WRR, is a clear winner for both lists. It is even true that each of the probable three errors in the Koren edition contribute to WRR's advantage in both lists._x000D_
_x000D_
It may be noticed that the values in Table 4 appear to contradict the experiments we did on random corruption. The explanation is partly that the variance of the effect is large (as the table shows clearly) and partly that our experiments used random deletions (because that is the reverse of the general historic trend). The differences counted in the table comprise a mixture of deletions and insertions, and these tend to cancel each other out somewhat. _x000D_
_x000D_
One rather ingenious argument that has been advanced to handle the problem of textual corruption runs as follows: the ""codes"" that we see today are merely a remnant of a much more perfect phenomenon that existed in the original text. The major problem with this argument is that the total amount of divergence from the original text has probably been enough to obliterate any perfect pattern several times over, not merely to dilute it. Moreover, there is a way to test the argument experimentally. If textual corruption occurred more or less in random places, it would have preferentially destroyed large-span ELSs more than short-span ELSs. However, this does not match the evidence. This is especially clear for the first list of rabbis: if the experiment of WRR is preserved in every way except that ELSs spanning more than 2000 letters (from the first to the last letters of the ELS) are ignored, the permutation ranks of P1l4 are all greater than 0.15. In other words, the ""phenomenon"" is based in large part on ELSs that present easy targets to the process of textual corruption. Similarly, for the same list without a span limit, there is no detectable correlation between c(w, w') and max(s(w), s(w')), where s(w) is the least span of an ELS of w. The Spearman rank correlation statistic is only 0.015. Thus, there is good evidence against the conjecture that the present ""codes"" are the remnants of earlier more perfect ""codes.""_x000D_

12. CONCLUSIONS _x000D_
In the words of editor Robert Kass, the paper of WRR was presented in this journal as a ""challenging puzzle."" The single most baffling part of the puzzle was the fact that WRR, ""[i]n order to avoid any conceivable appearance of having fitted the tests to the data,"" produced a ""fresh sample, without changing anything else"" (WRR94), but nevertheless obtained a remarkable result. The solution to the puzzle lies in considering, not fitting of the tests to the data, but ""tuning"" of the data to the tests. Not only did we identify the unacknowledged source of the flexibility (primarily the fact that the available set of appellations for the famous rabbis is more than twice as large as the set actually used), but we proved that this flexibility is enough to allow a similar result in a secular text. We supported this claim by observing that, when the many arbitrary parameters of WRR's experiment are varied, the result is usually weakened, and also by demonstrating traces of naive statistical expectations in WRR's experiment. Be that as it may, our most telling evidence against the ""codes"" is that we cannot find them. All of our many earnest experiments produced results in line with random chance. These included a re-enactment of the famous rabbis experiment with the help of independent experts, Emanuel and Assaf. In light of these findings, we believe that Kass' ""challenging puzzle"" has been solved._x000D_","A paper of Witztum, Rips and Rosenberg in this journal in 1994 made the extraordinary claim that the Hebrew text of the Book of Genesis encodes events which did not occur until millennia after the text was written. In reply, we argue that Witztum, Rips and Rosenberg's case is fatally defective, indeed that their result merely reflects on the choices made in designing their experiment and collecting the data for it. We present extensive evidence in support of that conclusion. We also report on many new experiments of our own, all of which failed to detect the alleged phenomenon.","1",0,"1","Apolitical",4,0
25,4,"Roth, Y., & Yakobi, O. (2024). Attention! Do We Really Need Attention Checks?. Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, 37(2), e2377.","The numerous advantages of virtual labs mean that studies are increasingly run online. However, this environment comes at the cost of researchers' reduced control over their samples, with some participants trying to take advantage of the system by, for example, doing numerous experiments simultaneously, working in groups, or providing completely random responses in experiments. These and other fraudulent behaviors have led to ever-growing concerns regarding data quality (e.g., Chmielewski and Kucker 2019)._x000D_
_x000D_
One common practice to ensure high quality data is the use of multiple attention tests (Berinsky et al. 2021). Yet this practice has obvious drawbacks‚Äîit extends the experiment, may distract and annoy genuine participants, and can even lead them to intentionally misbehave in extreme cases. The current paper examines whether one simple attention test is enough to differentiate attentive participants (those who pass the attention test) from inattentive ones in decisions-from-experience checking studies (experiments in which participants engage in a repetitive task where they must choose among a number of alternatives, and where they gain sufficient experience to perform the task well during the experiment itself)._x000D_
_x000D_
Our results highlight two main findings. First, attentive participants exhibit a pre-disposition towards checking (across all studies we found first trial checking rates of 0.47 vs. 0.31 for attentive vs. inattentive participants, respectively). Second, it appears that attentive participants, defined as those who passed the attention check, are indeed more attentive to the task in general, meaning they are more likely to notice differences in the average payoff between different alternatives, which may be subtle and not obvious from casual observation. By contrast, inattentive participants have higher sensitivity to the typical outcome (i.e., immediate differences between the payoffs of different alternatives, which are easier to discern even through casual observation). When the task is very difficult or very easy the choice rates of attentive and inattentive participants are indistinguishable (masked by the ease or difficulty of the task). Yet, in the middle ground, there are meaningful differences between the two types of participants._x000D_
_x000D_
Notably, our results fully replicate the results of two physical lab experiments by Roth (2020) and one unpublished lab study, but only for attentive participants. These replications highlight the importance of the attention test, because considering both attentive and inattentive participants together would have led to a spurious conclusion, implying either that the experiments were not replicable or that online participants differed from physical lab subjects. Attentive participants also self-reported higher conscientiousness scores: 3.88 and 3.48 for attentive and inattentive participants, respectively, averaged across all experiments (see Appendix S2 for a report and discussion of the findings on conscientiousness)._x000D_
_x000D_
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to systematically examine attention checks in decisions from experience. Our results show that in these tasks, even one simple attention check is enough to differentiate attentive participants from inattentive ones. Furthermore, comparison of our initial test, which was embedded in the instructions, to the end-of-study attention test reveals that there is nothing inherently special about the initial test. In fact, the end-of-study test had a major advantage in that more participants passed it while still providing similar data quality (as measured by average checking rates and comparisons to physical lab studies). However, the end-of-study test was particularly tailored to the experimental paradigm used in the current study, while the initial test is more general. In future research we plan to investigate whether one task-tailored test (e.g., asking about some important feature of the experiment, such as the highest/lowest observed payoff) is enough to differentiate between participants who did versus did not take the experiment seriously (see a related idea in Hartman et al. 2023, showing the advantage of using particular questions to verify participants' age or ethnicity)._x000D_
_x000D_
More broadly, our findings highlight the advantage of using decisions-from-experience paradigms, in which participants are given ample opportunity to learn about the task on their own. In particular, the fact that participants receive only minimal instructions and learn the task on their own allows us to relax the hard-to-ensure assumption‚Äîoften common in experimental economics and related fields‚Äîthat participants read, understand, and trust the experimental instructions (Erev 2020). All the studies here were run through MTurk and restricted to a North American population (we acknowledge that we were not able to ensure participants were indeed from the targeted population, as we could not detect fraudulent practices such as the use of proxy IPs or participants using other people's MTurk identification numbers; Difallah, Filatova, and Ipeirotis 2018; Moss et al. 2021), but based on our experience with other platforms and other samples (not reported here), we believe the results of studies using this paradigm should be stable across different platforms and populations, with even one attention test enough to ensure high quality data._x000D_
_x000D_
A few caveats must be mentioned. First, importantly, we do not claim that one attention test is necessarily enough to ensure high quality data in all experiments. Our findings apply only to decisions-from-experience studies, as explained above. Second, to benefit from the high quality data afforded by attention tests, it goes without saying that analyses should include only attentive participants (except in research focusing on inattentive respondents). Third, we strongly advise that exclusion criteria should be preregistered, to avoid questions over ‚Äúcherry picking‚Äù the data (especially when there are multiple attention tests in the study). Fourth, over time it is important to continually modify the attention tests used, so that subjects seeking to game the system do not learn to identify and pass them._x000D_
_x000D_
Finally, clearly, using attention tests is not the only way to ensure data quality. Among the other best practices is to restrict participants to those with a significant proven history of high quality data submission (Peer, Vosgerau, and Acquisti 2014). However, that approach is less suited to experiments that need to test ‚Äúna√Øve‚Äù rather than highly experienced participants (Peer et al. 2017) (Although theoretically experimenters can request highly qualified na√Øve participants; that is, subjects who have only taken part in a small number of experiments and have a low HIT rejection rate, in practice this strategy does not work, since rejection rates are in general very low. Thus, even low-quality workers will usually have a high acceptance rate in a small number of experiments.) Another drawback is that it potentially limits the diversity of the subject pool. Another strategy is to use one of the many alternative platforms (e.g., CloudResearch or Prolific) with higher quality restricted participant samples (Hauser et al. 2022; Litman et al. 2021). Future research should systematically investigate whether combining these strategies (e.g., using one attention test with a restricted participant pool) further improves data quality in decisions-from-experience studies.
","There is ongoing debate over the usefulness of and need for attention checks in online experiments. This paper investigates the value of these tests in decisions-from-experience (i.e., multi-trial repeated choice) tasks. In five studies (Ntotal‚Äâ=‚Äâ1519), we comprehensively compared the behavior of attentive and inattentive participants (i.e., those who passed or failed a simple attention check) among online participants; and also compared those results to the results of lab studies reported elsewhere. We found meaningful differences between the behavior of attentive and inattentive participants even at the first trial. Overall, attentive participants were more likely to notice less-obvious average values of the different alternatives, while inattentive participants exhibited higher sensitivity to typical outcomes. The findings show that even one simple attention test is sufficient to differentiate between attentive and inattentive participants in repetitive tasks. Importantly, our results fully replicated three previously run lab studies among attentive participants, but not inattentive ones. This finding highlights the importance of using attention tests to avoid spurious conclusions.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,1

Judgment and Decision Making, 15(3), 304-310.","The current analysis suggests that basic decision research has high potential, but its present impact is much lower than it could be. The potential is high because money does indeed make the world go round, but the direction of spin is sensitive to the exact incentive structure. Thus, an effective means to predict the impact of distinct incentive structures on human decisions can help address existing social problems and prevent new ones. Moreover, the importance of basic decision research to the design of effective incentive structures is enhanced by the big data revolution, which allows the redesign of many social environments._x000D_
_x000D_
The limited present impact of extant decision research may be the product of convergence to a local maximum ‚Äì that is, convergence to an area of low elevation in the land of assumptions illustrated in Figure 1. The current analysis highlights the importance of two conventions that appear to direct previous research to a hill of low elevation. The first is the use of restrictive working assumptions. Mainstream decision research assumes that the main deviations from maximization reflect the impact of subjective functions. This assumption clarifies the differences between the proposed models and EUT, but it also leads basic research to a bounded area in the land of assumptions. The second restrictive convention involves the reliance on systematic hypothesis testing methods which direct research to focus on small refinements of the popular models, and ignore the possibility that their basic assumptions should be re-considered._x000D_
_x000D_
I propose that these difficulties can be addressed through choice prediction competitions that facilitate the exploration of wider sets of assumptions, and reduce the risk of convergence to a local maximum in the land of assumptions. CPC15 demonstrates the potential of competitions of this type. It shows that prediction of decisions under risk and ambiguity can be improved by replacing efforts to incrementally refine the popular models with models that assume very different underlying processes. While the popular models assume that decisions reflect the impact of subjective functions which bias the final outcomes, the best predictions in CPC15 were provided by models in which the expected payoffs are weighted with the outcomes obtained in small samples of past experiences._x000D_
_x000D_
The key difference between the current analysis and mainstream behavioral decision research involves the use of rational models. While mainstream research uses rational models as benchmarks, the current analysis uses them as tools that can help predict the impact of money. For example, BEAST assumes some sensitivity to EV, and also predicts when behavior is likely to converge to EV maximization._x000D_
_x000D_
In order to clarify the wider implications of the present analysis, it is important to recall that people have more important goals than earning money. I believe that the current analysis can help us advance our understanding of these more important goals ‚Äì which are also typically more difficult to study ‚Äì in two ways. First, the approach supported here, namely facilitating the exploration of large changes in our working assumptions by using prediction competitions, can help clarify the impact of these other goals. Second, in certain settings the understanding of the impact of money can help advance other goals and increase social welfare._x000D_","As the adage goes, ‚Äúmoney makes the world go round‚Äù ‚Äì but which direction does it spin? This analysis considers how basic decision research can help us work out how to answer this question. It suggests that the difficulty of deriving clear predictions based on existing decision research is at least partly rooted in two restrictive conventions. The first is the focus on deviations from rational choice, and the effort to capture observed deviations by assuming subjective value functions. While it is difficult to reject the hypothesis that choice behavior reflects the weighting of subjective values, it is not clear that it advances the derivation of useful predictions. A second restrictive convention is the focus on objective hypothesis testing, which favors analyses that evaluate small refinements of the popular models. The potential benefits of relaxing these conventions are considered, with reference to recent choice prediction competitions that facilitate the exploration of distinct assumptions and model development techniques. The winners in these competitions assume very different decision processes than those assumed by the popular ‚Äúsubjective functions‚Äù models.

27,4,"Teodorescu, K., Plonsky, O., Ayal, S., & Barkan, R. (2021). Frequency of enforcement is more important than the severity of punishment in reducing violation behaviors. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 118(42), e2108507118.","What is the best way to reduce violations? The high cost of close monitoring and negative consequences of severe sanctions (e.g., more officers and negative mass reactance) render full severe enforcement impractical. Instead, two common enforcement policies trade off the probability of inspection with the severity of punishment. Our findings suggest that in repeated settings, frequent inspection with mild punishment is more effective in reducing violation behaviors than rare severe punishment. In all four studies, which included frequent versus rare inspections, the HILS policy was more effective at reducing violation rates than the LIHS policy, although these two polices had an equal EV. This finding was independent of potential improvement in perceptual skill and held even when we increased deterrence by providing information about the magnitude of the fine in advance. Furthermore, the advantage of the HILS policy was more pronounced among participants who tended to commit more violations at baseline. The results of the last study demonstrate the effects of changing the probability of inspection on enforcement effectiveness. Study 3a showed that the advantage of HILS over LIHS increased for more extreme probabilities of inspection (0.06 versus 0.94). Study 3b showed a boundary condition for the greater effectiveness of the probability of inspection over the severity of punishment in reducing violations. When the enforcement policy presented moderate probabilities (0.33 versus 0.66) and penalties, there was no significant difference between a policy with higher probability of inspection and smaller fines and a policy with lower probability of inspection and larger fines. Importantly, LIHS was not found to be more effective than HILS in any of the studies._x000D_
_x000D_
These findings are consistent with the decisions-from-experience hypothesis and specifically with the phenomenon of underweighting of rare events (23, 38, 39). Consistent with this phenomenon, in repeated settings, rare severe punishments are underweighted, causing deterrence to lose its initial effect over time. Underweighting of rare events is often argued to be the outcome of a decision mechanism that implies reliance on small samples of past experiences (39, 40). According to this mechanism, on each trial, decision makers only recall a small sample of previous experiences with each of the options and choose the option with the higher sample mean. The rarer an experience is, the less likely it is to be included in the recalled sample, and therefore the more likely it is to be given less weight than it deserves. This explains why, in the current context, rare severe punishments were less deterring than frequent but smaller punishments. The reliance on a small samples mechanism also helps to explain the boundary conditions found in Study 3b, in which the probabilities of inspection were moderate (0.33 versus 0.66). Here, the recalled sample is less likely to underrepresent inspection experiences, thus substantially reducing the advantage of HILS over LIHS._x000D_
_x000D_
Interestingly, our findings are also consistent with empirical studies showing that the severity of criminal sanctions is not correlated with the level of crime in society (41), whereas enforcement prevalence has consistently been found to be related to crime rates (42). Our controlled experimental setting demonstrates a causal link between enforcement prevalence and violation rates for a general (noncriminal) population and for small-scale violations and punishments, therefore supporting and extending the recommendation often made in the crime literature to increase punishment prevalence rather than severity (43‚Äì45)._x000D_
_x000D_
Our results run counter to the economic hypothesis, which posits that severe punishments are more effective than high monitoring in reducing violations in the general population (1‚Äì3, 5). One plausible reason for this discrepancy is that experimental studies supporting the economic prediction tend to employ an explicit descriptive setting with very few opportunities for violation. The current studies employed an arguably more ecologically valid setting, in which implicit opportunities to violate were repeated many times and the probability of inspection was not described a priori. Hence, the difference could be the result of a description-experience gap in violation decisions, similar to the gap found in risky choice (46)._x000D_
_x000D_
In line with self-concept maintenance theory, under no external enforcement, most of our participants did not maximize profits through violations, supporting the suggested role of internal cost as a gatekeeper of morality. Note that self-concept maintenance theory does not offer a clear prediction regarding external enforcement. Our findings demonstrate the sensitivity to external enforcement and pave the way for further research in this direction. In real life, small violations tend to be recurring. Incorporating the effect of feedback, inspection, and fine severity in the research of behavioral ethics may provide insights and shed light on how enforcement can shape the moral self and the internal barrier over time. To give but one example, applying external enforcement for a certain violation may either trigger an internal signal and direct the moral self to realize that this violation is ‚Äúmorally wrong‚Äù (47), or it may signal that this is something ‚Äúyou can buy your way out of,‚Äù as in ‚Äúa fine is a price‚Äù (32). Future research is thus needed to explore this and other long-term dynamics of moral considerations in the presence of enforcement._x000D_
_x000D_
From a practical standpoint, our findings suggest that when the inspection rate is low, policymakers should prioritize increasing the frequency of inspections over the severity of punishments. Since, in the real world, inspection rates are commonly very low,«Å our findings suggest that increasing inspection rates even by as little as a few percentage points could be highly effective in reducing violations. For example, in our studies, an inspection rate of 6% reduced violation rates by 12% (from 32 to 28% in Study 3a), while an inspection rate of 10% with smaller fines reduced violation rates by more than 38% (from 36 to 22% in Study 2). Although increasing the magnitude of fines was often considered as less costly (1), recent advances in technology and the increasing usage of artificial intelligence algorithms enable more effective monitoring at significantly lower costs (49‚Äì51). Moreover, large fines could result in a perception of unfairness and consequently reduce the probability of detection (52, 53), which, according to our results, is the key factor. In a similar vein, empirical crime researchers have argued that programs focusing on increasing punishment severity entail greater costs in their implementation (43‚Äì45). Thus, while many regulators in the current COVID-19 pandemic have publicly called to increase the magnitude of fines, our findings strongly suggest that ‚Äúgentle rule enforcement,‚Äù which includes smaller punishments with a higher probability (54‚Äì57), would be more effective in reducing violation rates, especially for high offenders, the target population of any enforcement policy._x000D_","External enforcement policies aimed to reduce violations differ on two key components: the probability of inspection and the severity of the punishment. Different lines of research offer different insights regarding the relative importance of each component. In four studies, students and Prolific crowdsourcing participants (Ntotal = 816) repeatedly faced temptations to commit violations under two enforcement policies. Controlling for expected value, we found that a policy combining a high probability of inspection with a low severity of fines (HILS) was more effective than an economically equivalent policy that combined a low probability of inspection with a high severity of fines (LIHS). The advantage of prioritizing inspection frequency over punishment severity (HILS over LIHS) was greater for participants who, in the absence of enforcement, started out with a higher violation rate. Consistent with studies of decisions from experience, frequent enforcement with small fines was more effective than rare severe fines even when we announced the severity of the fine in advance to boost deterrence. In addition, in line with the phenomenon of underweighting of rare events, the effect was stronger when the probability of inspection was rarer (as in most real-life inspection probabilities) and was eliminated under moderate inspection probabilities. We thus recommend that policymakers looking to effectively reduce recurring violations among noncriminal populations should consider increasing inspection rates rather than punishment severity.","4",0,"4","Political",3,1
28,4,"Yakobi, O., Cohen, D., Naveh, E., & Erev, I. (2020). Reliance on small samples and the value of taxing reckless behaviors. Judgment and Decision Making, 15(2), 266-281.","Previous research suggests that the effort to increase safety by taxing reckless behaviors can backfire. Under certain conditions, the taxation of risky decisions impairs safety. The current analysis clarifies these conditions. It shows that this effect emerges even when the tax is carefully designed to ensure that the expected outcome of the undesirable reckless behaviors is, from the agents‚Äô point of view, lower than the expected benefit from the desirable safe behavior. Experiment 2 shows that the negative effect of high taxation is not eliminated by experience (of 100 trials) with full feedback in which the choice of the problematic risky prospect reduces the expected return from 1.35 to 0.21. Experiment 1 presents a counterexample to the assertion that high incentives are more effective than low incentives (Gneezy & Rustichini, 2000). The results reflect a U-shaped effect of taxation: low taxation is effective, but high taxation backfires.

Overall, the hypotheses derived from na√Øve sampler models were partially supported by the data. Yet, the preregistered hypotheses over-predict the negative effect of high taxation in Experiment 1, and under-predict this effect in Experiment 2. Post hoc comparison of alternative models suggests that the main driver of the observed negative impact of high taxation might be a tendency to rely on a subsample of past experiences. The results are best captured with models assuming that on average the decision makers rely on sample of 13 to 24 past experiences. While this sample size is larger than suggested by the previous research that underlies our pre-registered predictions, it is small enough to trigger the observed U-shaped effect. To understand why reliance on small sample can trigger a negative effect of high taxation, note that reliance on small samples implies high sensitivity to the frequent outcomes. The negative effect of high taxation occurs, under the current hypothesis, when the taxation targets a moderately risky behavior, and reduces the frequent outcome of this behavior below the frequent outcome of a counterproductive riskier option. Thus, high taxation of a moderate risky option, can lead agents that rely on small samples to prefer a riskier option even when this behavior significantly impairs their expected return.

In order to clarify the implications of the current analysis to the basic study of decisions from experience, it is constructive to consider two possible explanations to the relatively large subsample size estimated in the present work (average of 13 to 24 past experiences) compared with previous research (reviewed in Erev & Roth, 2014). The first explanation assumes that with more alternatives (three in the present work and two in Erev and Roth‚Äôs review) decision makers rely on larger sample size. The second explanation states that the difference reflects a ‚Äúrelatively flat MSD (error) function‚Äù. That is, in the current context the prediction error of the reliance on small samples models is relatively insensitive to value of Œ∫ in the ranges we examined. While the first explanation questions the practical value of the reliance on small samples hypothesis (it implies that the exact parameter changes with the number of alternatives), the second highlights its potential (it implies relative robustness to the exact parameter).

To compare these explanations, we derived the predictions of the models presented above (with the pre-registered and the re-estimated parameters) for trials 75 to 100 in the six conditions used by Erev and Roth (2014), which allow us to demonstrate the main properties of binary decisions from experience. The left-hand side of Table 4 presents the experimental conditions and main results. The first four problems document the original payoff variability effect (e.g., lower maximization rate in the problem with payoff variability), and the two lower problems demonstrate underweighting of rare events (risk seeking in Problem ER5, and risk aversion in Problem ER6). The right hand columns in Table 4 show that all four fitted models capture these two phenomena. In addition, the results show that the MSD of the models estimated above is only slightly higher than the MSD of the Œ∫ = 9 models. Over the two sets of conditions (Tables 3 and 4), the models with the parameters estimated above outperform the models with the pre-registered parameters. We feel that these observations support the ‚Äúrelatively flat error function‚Äù explanation. The results demonstrate that it is possible to capture Erev and Roth‚Äôs and the current results with a single one-parameter model (the 2-stage na√Øve sampler captures the results the best), and the estimated parameter implies reliance on an average sample size of more than 5 observations. More importantly, the results suggest that accurate estimation of models that assumes reliance on small samples requires large set of experiments, and it is natural to assume that the current estimations can be improved. We hope to address this task in future research.

At first glance the success of the Œ∫ =24 Na√Øve2 model (and the Œ∫ =47 Na√Øve1 model) appears to be inconsistent with the observation that the ‚Äúreliance on small samples‚Äù implies underweighting of a 10% event only when the sample size is smaller than 7 (Teodorescu et al., 2013; Shteingart & Loewenstein, 2015).5 More careful analysis reveals that the ‚Äúsample smaller than 7‚Äù observation was derived under the assumptions that (1) all choices are made with the same sample size, and (2) sampling without replacement. The current sampling models assume that (1) the actual sample size is uniformly distributed between 1 and Œ∫, and (2) sampling with replacement. Under the current na√Øve sampler models, a 10% event (e.g., in trials 76 to 100 while facing Problems ER5 or ER6) is underweighted as long as Œ∫<70 (average sample size smaller than 35.5).

A second contribution of the current analysis to basic decision-making research involves the clarification of the difference between the repeated decisions considered here and the one-shot decisions from sampling reviewed by Wulff, Mergenthaler-Canseco and Hertwig (2018). Wulff et al. show that the main properties of decisions from sampling can be captured with the assumption that decision makers behave as if they equally weight all the observed experiences. In contrast, the current results suggest that in repeated decisions, decision makers behave as if they rely on a sub-sample of their past experiences. The difference can be explained with the hypothesis that experiences with repeated decisions increase the effort to response to patterns by selecting the option that led to the best outcome in the most similar past experiences (Plonsky et al., 2015).

A third contribution of the current analysis to basic research involves the documentation of a reversed payoff variability effect. While the original effect implies that payoff variability increases random choice (as demonstrated in Table 4), in the current high taxation conditions, an increase in the payoff variability of the EV maximizing option, increased maximization. Importantly, the reliance on small samples hypothesis correctly predicts the direction of the payoff variability effect.

Wider practical implications of the current results stem from the minimalistic nature of the current experimental paradigm relative to settings examined in previous demonstrations of the negative effects of economic incentives. All the previous demonstrations of the negative impact of economic incentives we are familiar with (see review in Gneezy, Meier & Rey-Biel, 2011) emerge in situations in which the incentives are explicitly described (i.e., decision from description). The leading explanations of these demonstrations focus on the description. They state that the description provides a signal that changes the subjective utilities, and the exact effect appears to be situation specific. While the current results do not question the validity of these explanations, they demonstrate the existence of a very different contributor to these effects. The negative effect of incentives demonstrated here, is not a result of a specific signal; it appears to reflect a general property of human learning that emerges in choice between more than two alternatives. The current results can be captured with simple quantitative models with clear implications. Specifically, the reliance on small sample models suggest that monetary incentives backfire when they are designed to reduce the choice rates of a moderately undesirable behavior, but increase the proportion of experiences in which an even less desirable behavior leads to the best outcomes.","New technology can be used to enhance safety by imposing costs, or taxes, on certain reckless behaviors. The current paper presents two pre-registered experiments that clarify the impact of taxation of this type on decisions from experience between three alternatives. Experiment 1 focuses on an environment in which safe choices maximize expected returns and examines the impact of taxing the more attractive of two risky options. The results reveal a U-shaped effect of taxation: some taxation improves safety, but too much taxation impairs safety. Experiment 2 shows a clear negative effect of high taxation even when the taxation eliminates the expected benefit from risk-taking. Comparison of alternative models suggests that taxing reckless behaviors backfires when it significantly increases the proportion of experiences in which a more dangerous behavior leads to better outcomes than the taxed behavior. Qualitative hypotheses derived from na√Øve sampling models assuming small samples were only partially supported by the data.","4",0,"4","Political",4,0

Selecting the most effective nudge: Evidence from a large-scale experiment on immunization (No. w28726). National Bureau of Economic Research.","While immunization is one of the most effective and cost-effective method to prevent illness, disability, and disease, millions of children continue to go without it every year. The COVID-19 epidemic risks making the situation even worse: during the pandemic, vaccine coverage has dipped to levels not seen since the 1990s (Bill and Melinda Gates, 2020). Swift policy action will be critical to ensure that this dip is temporary, and children who missed immunizations during the pandemic get covered soon. _x000D_
_x000D_
To study effective policies to encourage immunization, we conducted a large policy experiment in 2360 villages in India covering 295,038 children. Strategies available to policymakers include conventional instruments such as reminders and incentives, each of which can be designed in a number of ways (e.g., with different coverage rates, levels of incentives, shape of the incentive curve), as well as a new policy, derived from insights from social network analysis (ambassadors from the community to encourage immunization take-up). Again, there are several variants such as recruiting information hubs, trusted individuals, individuals in the intersection of both, and random members of society. All told, our experiment covers 75 policies which exhausts all combinations of these arms. That is, we look at every possible policy combination available to the policymaker contemplating choosing one of these instruments with the goal of scaling it up. _x000D_
_x000D_
We develop a blueprint, a smart pooling and pruning procedure, to perform policy analysis in this context, in a data-driven manner. First, we assume that only a sparse set of policy combinations meaningfully affects the outcome of interest (here the number of immunizations or the number of immunizations per dollar). Furthermore, there may not necessarily be appreciable differences in the effects of variants in policies differing only in their intensity profiles. By applying the appropriate transformation to represent the data in a manner amenable to pooling and pruning, and then using the Puffer transformation, we are able to consistently recover the collection of relevant policies and obtain consistent estimates of these pooled policies (and confidence intervals) following the post-LASSO procedure described in Chernozhukov et al. (2015). This allows us to identify which policies matter and what kind of flexibility it affords the policymaker. For example, we can see in a data-driven way if high and low incentives tend to have the same effect, which would allow the policymaker to choose lower and cheaper incentives. _x000D_
_x000D_
Second, we estimate the impact of the best policy in the sense of maximizing either the number of vaccines or number of vaccines per dollar. To do so requires overcoming the winner‚Äôs curse. Because the policy deemed to be the best is one that, by definition, in the sample has to have an effect bigger than all the other policies, it is more likely to have benefitted from a larger random shock as well and therefore the estimate of its effect will be upward biased. We use the techniques in Andrews et al. (2019) to overcome this and construct (nearly) median unbiased estimates for the number of vaccines (or number of vaccines per dollar) for the best policy. We estimate the best policy in either case to be one where the policymaker uses information hubs and sends SMS reminders to 33% of the community. If we give up on cost effectiveness, we should add to these two sloped incentives at the low amount. From the cost effectiveness perspective simply using information hubs and a low saturation of SMS reminders emerges as the best policy, and is more cost effective than the status quo of no policy. _x000D_
_x000D_
One possible interpretation, especially given that the most effective ambassador is the information hub (recall this is the person best placed to circulate information according to the community) is that the ambassador ensures widespread diffusion about the presence of the incentives (in incentives villages) and is able to explain and de-mystify the content of the personalized reminders (in SMS villages, even without incentives).22 In either case, the ambassador has something quite concrete to discuss with the people they talk to (which is not the case in villages without SMS or incentives, perhaps explaining why they have no effect in this case). All told, this suggests that the social network can be used in creative and cost-effective ways to amplify the effect of other policies. _x000D_
_x000D_
There are three main takeaways. First, from the perspective of public health policy, standard tools that have previously been championed (e.g., SMS reminders) may not be particularly effective and others such as high sloped incentives may not be cost-effective at large scale, such as at a state or national level (although Chernozhukov et al. (2018) find it may be cost effective in pockets of low immunization villages, where it is predicted to be most effective). But using such instruments in combination, particularly with policy insights from social network analysis, yields effective, and cost-effective policies. _x000D_
_x000D_
Second, the results are consistent with recent literature pointing to the importance of leveraging networks to diffuse information in a variety of economic contexts. Here, this principle suggests that policymakers can benefit tremendously from identifying information hubs to accelerate take-up. These perspectives typically are not in a policymaker‚Äôs toolkit, but the literature increasingly points to the necessity to incorporate such lessons. _x000D_
_x000D_
Third, there is a temptation when doing a policy experiment to pare down the number of treatments one is willing to evaluate for power concerns and because selective ex-post pooling can cause biases. However, this has the downside that it requires the policymaker to be somewhat sure of the set of effective policies in the first place. But that assumes the conclusion: if one could already pick the best four policies out of 75 feasible ones, testing out policies may be second order. On the other hand, if there was genuine uncertainty about what works, which is how the problem was presented to us in this case, ex ante paring down the options may get us the wrong answer. In particular, the suggestion of avoiding all interactions in this setting (made in Muralidharan et al. (2019)), would have led to the conclusion that nothing is effective. _x000D_
_x000D_
To manage the rapidly increasing number of treatment bundles policymakers may consider, we suggest instead a data-driven approach wherein under a natural assumption that most policies are unlikely to be effective, we can use machine learning to identify the sparse set of policies that meaningfully affect the outcome of interest. Given this, we can estimate the effect of the best policy in terms of the outcome of interest, accounting for the winner‚Äôs curse. This is a straightforward procedure and one that could easily be specified in a pre-analysis plan. The researcher can gain power by incorporating prior knowledge of the policies that are likely to ‚Äúpool‚Äù together (in this instance, these are doses of a treatment) in the smart pooling specification, without making a prior assumption that they have to pool. This structure can easily be pre-specified, and beyond that the researcher does not need to take a stance on the possible effects of a number of interactions that are very hard to predict in advance._x000D_","We evaluate a large-scale set of interventions to increase demand for immunization in Haryana, India. The policies under consideration include the two most frequently discussed tools‚Äî reminders and incentives‚Äîas well as an intervention inspired by the networks literature. We cross-randomize whether (a) individuals receive SMS reminders about upcoming vaccination drives; (b) individuals receive incentives for vaccinating their children; (c) influential individuals (information hubs, trusted individuals, or both) are asked to act as ‚Äúambassadors‚Äù receiving regular reminders to spread the word about immunization in their community. By taking into account different versions (or ‚Äúdosages‚Äù) of each intervention, we obtain 75 unique policy combinations. We develop a new statistical technique‚Äîa smart pooling and pruning procedure‚Äî for finding a best policy from a large set, which also determines which policies are effective and the effect of the best policy. We proceed in two steps. First, we use a LASSO technique to collapse the data: we pool dosages of the same treatment if the data cannot reject that they had the same impact, and prune policies deemed ineffective. Second, using the remaining (pooled) policies, we estimate the effect of the best policy, accounting for the winner‚Äôs curse. The key outcomes are (i) the number of measles immunizations and (ii) the number of immunizations per dollar spent. The policy that has the largest impact (information hubs, SMS reminders, incentives that increase with each immunization) increases the number of immunizations by 44 % relative to the status quo. The most cost-effective policy (information hubs, SMS reminders, no incentives) increases the number of immunizations per dollar by 9.1%.","Apolitical",1,"4","Political",4,1

Political Psychology, 23(2), 285-301.","Using Kaplan‚Äôs (1972) method of collecting separate attitude components, and doing so (for what may be the first time) in a cross-sectional survey, we have been able to show that some voters do indeed harbor simultaneous positive and negative feelings toward certain attitude objects‚Äîin this case, the issue of abortion.12 The amount of ambivalence observed among Floridians was fairly modest, but it was sufficient to provide support for the findings reported earlier by Alvarez and Brehm(1995) concerning abortion attitudes among the American public generally. However, we differ from the Alvarez-Brehm model in distinguishing not between ‚Äúeasy‚Äù and ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù questions, but rather between abortion under ‚Äútraumatic‚Äù versus ‚Äúelective‚Äù circumstances. For pro-life voters, questions about whether to permit abortions under traumatic circumstances are more difficult and tend to create higher levels of ambivalence; for pro-choice advocates, elective conditions present the greater degree of difficulty. Even individuals who are at the ‚Äúextremes‚Äù of the issue occasionally find themselves confronted with a conflict involving their core beliefs. _x000D_
_x000D_
We hope that our results will encourage political scientists to take a greater interest in the subject of attitudinal ambivalence and, as they do, to consider how some of the measurement approaches used by social psychologists can be adapted to the study of larger and more representative populations. Although full-blown ambivalence and preference batteries may be too time-consuming for inclusion in omnibus surveys, we believe that this exercise has demonstrated the practicality‚Äîand theoretical importance‚Äîof directly measuring ambivalence in surveys designed specifically for that purpose. Our interviews, which also tapped respondents‚Äô attitudes toward prominent political leaders, pre-election vote preferences, political knowledge, partisan attachments, basic demographics, and a handful of other orientations, generally lasted about 20 to 25 minutes. Surveys that are designed to probe attitudes toward one or two issues in depth should have little difficulty doing so, with sufficient time left over to investigate the individual-level correlates of ambivalence‚Äîfor example, whether it is a trait of certain voters 13 or, alternatively, whether there are ambivalence ‚Äúissue publics‚Äù (Converse, 1964)whose composition varies across policy domains. Along the same lines, a survey experiment might be used to determine the extent to which ambivalence is subject to media- or leadership-based framing effects. _x000D_
_x000D_
Ultimately, what we most want to know is whether ambivalence matters, that is, what are its consequences for the nature of our political discourse? Is it possible, for example, that ambivalence can help to explain the well-documented instability of mass attitudes (see Craig et al., 2000), 14 some voters‚Äô apparent desire for divided government (Fiorina, 1996), the difficulty experienced by many citizens in casting an issue-based vote, and other important aspects of American politics? From the candidate‚Äôs point of view, does the degree of electoral risk encountered as a result of waffling on an issue (or ignoring it altogether) depend, as one might suspect, on the ambivalence level of voters for whom that issue is highly salient? And are there systematic variations in ambivalence (apart from pro-choicers scoring higher on elective abortion, pro-lifers on traumatic abortion) that need to be taken into account by campaign strategists or, for that matter, by scholars who seek to improve our understanding of why people vote the way they do? Answers to these questions and others like them will not be forthcoming until we learn to do a better job of capturing, at the individual level, the full complexity of attitudes that citizens have on issues of public policy._x000D_","Recent research has recognized that many people simultaneously hold positive and negative attitudes about important political issues. This paper reviews the concept of attitudinal ambivalence and introduces a survey measure of ambivalence adapted from the experimental literature. An analysis of two statewide telephone surveys of Florida voters reveals that (1) a number of voters have ambivalent attitudes about abortion rights; (2) the amount of ambivalence varies according to the circumstances (elective versus traumatic) under which an abortion is obtained; (3) ambivalence about elective abortions is essentially unrelated to ambivalence about traumatic abortions; (4) voters who support abortion rights are more ambivalent about elective abortions than about traumatic abortions, whereas the pattern is reversed for abortion rights opponents; and (5) extreme views in support of or opposition to abortion rights can sometimes mitigate the amount of ambivalence felt by voters.","3",0,"3","Political",4,1

Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 50(4), 533-549.","Opponents of trans-inclusive policies, particularly policies that grant transgender women access to women-only spaces, often argue that they oppose such policies not because they hold negative attitudes toward trans people but because they are concerned that such policies will give predatory men access to these spaces and, in turn, the opportunity to harm women. Across seven studies using a wide array of operationalizations, we provide correlational and experimental evidence that these arguments do not reflect reality: Counter to what opponents themselves reported, opposition to trans-inclusive policies was consistently more strongly predicted by (explicit) trans attitudes compared with male violence concerns. Moreover, in Studies 6 and 7, manipulating explicit trans attitudes‚Äîbut not male violence associations‚Äîcreated shifts in policy support._x000D_
_x000D_
These findings are in line with psychological research showing that people can often have little insight into the reasons underlying their behaviors and beliefs (e.g., Nisbett & Wilson, 1977; Wilson, 2004) and may be viewed as an instance of covering (Crandall & Eshleman, 2003), that is, obscuring one‚Äôs prejudicial views by providing an alternative explanation._x000D_
_x000D_
For supporters of trans-inclusive policies, concerns about male violence were, if anything, associated with higher levels of support. This may reflect beliefs about who needs to be protected from such violence and the awareness that transgender women in men-only spaces are at a higher risk of becoming victims of male violence._x000D_

Theoretical and Practical Implications_x000D_
This work has important theoretical and practical implications for understanding the causes and consequences of anti-transgender prejudice. In 2022 alone, more than 150 anti-transgender bills have been proposed in the United States‚Äîmore than in any previous year (American Civil Liberties Union [ACLU], 2022). These bills adversely affect transgender people, for example, by forcing them to use facilities associated with their sex assigned at birth rather than their gender identity or by making it more difficult to change their gender on legal documents. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, a court ruled in 2021 that children below the age of 16 could no longer be prescribed puberty-blocking drugs (although this decision was later overturned on appeal; Siddique, 2021). Such legislation can have dramatic consequences on the mental health of those affected by them, up to and including suicide (e.g., Rew et al., 2021). Given the rising numbers of individuals who openly identify as transgender, it is important to understand and find ways to attenuate the psychological forces driving this surge in anti-trans legislation._x000D_
_x000D_
Our findings provide an important first step by showing that the reasons cited by opponents of such policies should not necessarily be taken at face value. Improving the safety of women, for instance, is unlikely to translate into greater support for trans-inclusive policies given that we find no empirical evidence that safety concerns are tied to reduced policy support. Relying on the overt discourse surrounding trans-inclusive policies and taking professed reasons at face value‚Äîinstead of empirically examining the underlying psychological mechanisms behind such beliefs‚Äîis thus likely to result in false conclusions about what drives legislative discrimination against transgender people. This is important not only practically‚Äîfor countering such legislation‚Äîbut also for better understanding the theoretical drivers of anti-trans discrimination, more broadly._x000D_
_x000D_
For instance, it is notable that opponents of trans-inclusive policies do not attribute their policy stances to their feelings about transgender people, despite the correlational and experimental evidence reported here showing that they are indeed very much related. This is, however, consistent with a long history in the literature documenting reluctance to openly disclose one‚Äôs own biases or prejudice (e.g., O‚ÄôBrien et al., 2010)._x000D_
_x000D_
Likewise, our hypothesis that opponents would not accurately report their reasons were less consistent for U.K. samples (Studies 3‚Äì4) than for U.S. samples (Studies 1, 2, and 5; see Tables 1 and 2 and online supplement). This is perhaps unsurprising. Values of equality and equal opportunity are key American values (see O‚ÄôBrien et al., 2010). Thus, Americans may be more motivated to appear nonprejudiced, both to themselves and to others, whereas British people may feel more comfortable openly acknowledging that their opposition to trans-inclusive policies is driven by their negative attitudes toward trans people._x000D_
_x000D_
These results also illustrate the methodological limitations of asking people to explain the causes of their own behavior. Although long noted in psychology that people do not have privileged access to their own mental processes (e.g., Nisbett & Wilson, 1977) and thus cannot accurately introspect on the cognitive processes driving their own behavior, asking people to report why they support a particular candidate, party, or policy is still commonplace in studying political behavior. While asking people to self-report their reasons is far easier than testing those causes empirically (as illustrated by this paper), accepting such answers at face value‚Äîrather than understanding them for the lay theories they are‚Äîhinders our ability to draw accurate scientific conclusions._x000D_
_x000D_
For instance, while we focused on policies that would grant transgender people access to gender/sex-segregated spaces, where women‚Äôs safety is primarily invoked, these are not the only policies for which trans-inclusion is relevant. Issues around fairness and gender equality are often mentioned in the context of transgender women‚Äôs access to women‚Äôs sports teams and of affirmative action to address gender inequality (see BBC, 2018; Magowan, 2018). Future research should investigate to what extent fairness perceptions are indeed at the core of opposition to such policies or if, once more, calls to ‚Äúprotect women‚Äù (in this case, women‚Äôs advancement) are merely used to disguise prejudice._x000D_
_x000D_
Finally, our findings add to the emerging literature on how beliefs about the role of women and men in society (e.g., feminist vs. traditional views) intersect with beliefs about the nature of gender and sex more broadly (i.e., who counts as a woman or a man). Understanding this ideological intersection is particularly relevant for understanding the growing gender-critical feminist movement, which has been outspoken in opposing trans-inclusive policies. Gender-critical feminists, often referred to by the more controversial term TERFs (trans-exclusionary radical feminists), hold biology-based views of womanhood and object to identity-based concepts of gender. Importantly, in a recent quasi-representative study of U.S. and U.K. feminists, gender-critical views are not ‚Äúfringe‚Äù‚Äîindeed, roughly half of self-identified feminists hold a gender-critical view, with trans inclusion being the most divisive issue among feminists (Morgenroth et al., 2022). While we did not investigate opposition to trans-inclusive policies among feminists specifically, our findings nevertheless casts doubt on the claims made by prominent feminists such as J. K. Rowling, quoted at the beginning of this article._x000D_
_x000D_
Across five studies, we find consistently that opponents of trans-inclusive policies cite women‚Äôs safety as driving their opposition. If this claim does not originate in people‚Äôs actual causal reasoning, where does it come from and why is it so widely endorsed by opponents of such policies? The argument that (cis)women are in need of protection from violent men who seek to do them harm echoes benevolent sexist views that women should be cherished and protected (Glick & Fiske, 1996). Benevolent sexism is more widely accepted than other forms of sexism (Barreto & Ellemers, 2005) but is associated with a range of outcome that decreases women‚Äôs safety, such as sexual harassment (Fiske & Glick, 1995) and negative reactions to rape victims (Viki & Abrams, 2002)._x000D_
_x000D_
Benevolent sexism works in tandem with hostile sexism (i.e., ambivalent sexism) to uphold the current gender system by seemingly rewarding women who adhere to gender norms and punishing women who go against such norms, such as women in leadership positions or feminists (Glick & Fiske, 1996). We suggest transgender women are another such group that is targeted for violating conventional cultural norms when it comes to gender, and that the concern about women‚Äôs safety cited by policy opponents stems from this. For instance, safety concerns often focus on the perceived need to protect cisgender women rather than transgender women. In one example, supporters of ‚Äúbathroom bills‚Äù cite concern about the safety of cisgender women if transgender women are permitted to use women‚Äôs bathrooms but overlook the safety of transgender women forced (by the same policy) to use men‚Äôs bathrooms. Notably, transgender women are a group not discussed or considered in the original conception of ambivalent sexism, suggesting that this theory may apply even in the novel, evolving social contexts. Future research should investigate the role of benevolent sexism in opposition to trans-inclusive policy stances more directly._x000D_
_x000D_
One means of extending this work is through a greater focus on transgender men. While our studies focused on an issue most relevant to transgender women, reflecting the current discourse, it would be interesting to examine whether similar arguments are used in the context of the inclusion of transgender men. Interestingly, such arguments often also seem to be focused on protecting ‚Äúwomen‚Äù and ‚Äúgirls‚Äù‚Äîin this case, lesbians and tomboys who are allegedly ‚Äúbrainwashed‚Äù into believing they are transgender and encouraged to do ‚Äúirreversible damage‚Äù to their bodies (see Stahl, 2021)._x000D_
_x000D_
Limitations and Future Research_x000D_
Our causal model and assumption, throughout the paper, is that trans attitudes are changing policy views, rather than vice versa. However, because Studies 1 to 4 are correlational, they cannot rule out the possibility that policy views are affecting transgender attitudes, or that third variables account for both. We addressed this possibility in two ways: first, in Study 5, rather than asking participants to report on the reasons for their views (for which we could not provide causal evidence), we instead asked them merely to predict the correlational strength of the relationship. That is, we compared the predicted strength of the relationship with the actual observed strength of the relationship and found the same thing: trans attitudes are more strongly related to policy stances than male-violence beliefs. Second, and more importantly, in Studies 6 and 7, we experimentally manipulated trans attitudes and male violence beliefs directly. While we observed increased policy support as a consequence of manipulating trans attitudes, we found no such effect of manipulating male violence beliefs, lending further experimental evidence that the causal chain flows from attitudes to policy, rather than vice versa._x000D_
_x000D_
Unfortunately, Studies 6 and 7 themselves had limitations, and we were not able to manipulate both constructs in the same study as would be ideal for comparing the relative strength of both potential causes. This is, however, perhaps not surprising given that both stereotypes and attitudes are difficult to manipulate (in general) and even harder to change in parallel manipulations that eliminate confounding variables. What was effective in manipulating attitudes was not effective in manipulating stereotypes and vice versa. Furthermore, the manipulations were quite different from each other. It is possible that something about these specific manipulations (imagined contact vs. imagining living in a future society) made it more or less likely for changes in stereotypes and attitudes to translate into policy views. Moreover, our manipulations were not as straightforward as we would have desired. In Study 6, the male violence manipulation did not affect male violence beliefs‚Äîbut did affect trans attitudes, and in Study 7, the trans attitudes manipulation moderated the effect of our male violence manipulation for reasons that are unclear (as the trans attitude manipulation itself was unsuccessful at manipulating attitudes)._x000D_
_x000D_
Nevertheless, we believe that, taken together, the findings from our experimental studies strengthen our claim. In Study 6, we successfully manipulated trans attitudes and these changes were reflected in policy views. In Study 7, we successfully manipulated male violence beliefs but these changes were not reflected in policy views. Future research should replicate and (hopefully) extend these findings by manipulating both simultaneously._x000D_
_x000D_
Conclusion_x000D_
Trans-inclusive policies are controversial, and opponents often claim that while they are supportive of trans people that cis-women‚Äôs safety needs to be protected. We find no evidence that concerns about male violence are the strongest predictor of such opposition; instead, negative attitudes toward transgender people are most strongly associated with the opposition. Our findings have important implications for those campaigning for trans inclusion, suggesting that the most effective strategies might be those aiming at changing attitudes rather than refuting arguments about the danger that trans inclusion allegedly poses to the safety of cisgender women._x000D_","Transgender women‚Äôs access to women-only spaces is controversial. Arguments against trans-inclusive policies often focus on cisgender women‚Äôs safety from male violence, despite little evidence to suggest that such policies put cisgender women at risk. Across seven studies using U.S. and U.K. participants (N = 3,864), we investigate whether concerns about male violence versus attitudes toward trans people are a better predictor of support for trans-inclusive policies and whether these factors align with the reasons given by opponents and supporters regarding their policy views. We find that opponents of these policies do not accurately report their reasons for opposition: Specifically, while opponents claim that concerns about male violence are the primary reason driving their opposition, attitudes toward transgender people more strongly predicted policy views. These results highlight the limitations of focusing on overt discourse and emphasize the importance of investigating psychological mechanisms underlying policy support.","1",0,"1","Political",2,1
32,5,"Barreto, M., & Ellemers, N. (2005). The perils of political correctness: Men's and women's responses to old-fashioned and modern sexist views. Social psychology quarterly, 68(1), 75-88.","In this study we examined the consequences of exposure to modern sexism, and compared these with the consequences of exposure to a more traditional form of sexism. In particular, we examined differences in the extent to which old-fashioned and modern sexist statements are perceived as reflecting prejudiced attitudes, as well as in the affective and behavioral responses these statements elicit. In addition, we not only investigated how these forms of sexism are perceived and experienced by women, the group targeted by sexism, but also examined the responses of men, the dominant group. The results are generally in line with our predictions, and indicate that politically correct ways of describing current gender relations (such as in modern sexism) may prove perilous because they are likely to remain unchallenged, despite their negative consequences. 

Modern sexism is assumed to constitute a more socially acceptable or politically correct expression of prejudice than old-fashioned or blatant sexism (e.g., Dovidio and Gaertner 1986; McConahay 1986; Swim et al. 1995). We first obtained empirical support for this assumption because we observed that people generally agreed more strongly with views expressing modern sexism than old-fashioned sexism. This difference was particularly pronounced among female research participants. 

More important, the results of our study corroborate the argument that detection of prejudice depends on situational cues (i.e., form of prejudice) as well as on the perceiver‚Äôs characteristics (i.e., perceiver‚Äôs gender). In line with past research (Baron et al. 1991; Inman and Baron 1996), our results show that sexism is recognized more easily when expressed by a male source, while detection seems to be less likely in the case of a female source. More important, and a new finding in the present study, situational cues and perceiver characteristics interact to reveal that women are more likely than men to perceive sexism when it is blatant, but less likely than men to recognize it when it is expressed in more covert forms (Hypothesis 1). In fact, both forms of sexism we examined are recognized as prejudicial by male perceivers. 

In the case of female observers, however, additional processes come into play because females belong to the group that is depicted (explicitly or implicitly) in a negative way. By comparing the responses of female and male perceivers‚Äîin contrast to previous research in this area, which usually focused only on the (potential) victims of prejudice‚Äîwe were able to establish that sensitivity to prejudice can be increased when one‚Äôs own group identity is the target of prejudiced attitudes, but only in the presence of clear prejudice cues. By contrast, when people face more subtle forms of prejudice (modern sexism, in this case), self-protective mechanisms may be set in motion to hinder detection of prejudice (also see Crosby 1984; Ruggiero and Taylor 1997). This finding is novel, and constitutes a significant advance in understanding why prejudice so often remains undetected in modern societies. It seems that because of the general reluctance to acknowledge that the self may suffer from disadvantage due to unfair treatment of one‚Äôs group, one may become less able to recognize prejudice that is expressed in politically correct ways. 

Old-fashioned and modern sexism also differ in their affective consequences for women and for men. Indeed, we observed that each form of sexism resulted in a specific kind of emotional response (Hypotheses 2a, 2b, 2c): old-fashioned sexism elicited more hostility among both women and men, while modern sexism induced more anxiety among women and less among men. That is, old-fashioned sexism elicited ‚Äúfight‚Äù-type affective responses, whereas modern sexism elicited ‚Äòflight‚Äô-type affect among women (Cannon [1932]1939; Lazarus and Folkman 1984).3 These results not only attest to the difference in the affective consequences of old and new forms of sexism; they also demonstrate that modern forms of sexism may remain undetected but are not inoffensive, particularly to women. We believe that this anxiety among women derives from the implications of modern sexism: That women possess inferior abilities, do not make an effort, and/or choose not to pursue a career. Although these implications may appear different at first sight, they all stem from stereotypical images of women (regarding their opportunities and preferences), and they all lead to attributions internal to women to explain their disadvantaged position in society. Future research might examine whether women in fact perceive modern sexism to carry these implications. 

We also found that men felt not only more hostile but also more anxious in the old-fashioned than in the modern sexism condition. Although we had predicted that men would feel hostile in the old-fashioned condition, we had not anticipated that they would also feel more anxious in this condition than when facing modern sexism. This increase in anxiety, however, is consistent with our broader argument that old-fashioned sexism also presents a threat to men (a threat to the legitimacy of their status), even though this is unlike the threat it presents to women (a threat to the value of their identity; see Branscombe, Ellemers et al. 1999). By contrast, modern sexism holds perilous implications for women but is actually flattering to men, and thus is associated less closely with anxiety (see note 1). When we compare women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs affective responses to modern sexism, it seems that denial of gender discrimination reassures and possibly flatters men but appears to threaten women, most likely because it legitimizes current gender inequalities. 

Another finding which suggests that subtle forms of prejudice may be more (rather than less) harmful than more blatant forms is the greater derogation of the source among participants exposed to old-fashioned sexism. That is, old-fashioned sexism elicits ‚Äúfight‚Äù-type responses in the sense that the response is directed at the source (i.e., derogation of the source). By contrast, because modern sexism is associated with inaction or ‚Äúflight‚Äù-type responses, it contributes to the maintenance of prejudicial attitudes; in this sense it may be seen as more harmful than old-fashioned sexism. That is, conditions that facilitate the recognition of prejudice or of illegitimate treatment result in attempts to challenge discriminatory views held by others (Dion 1975; Ellemers, Wilke and Van Knippenberg 1993; Hafer and Olson 1989; Sidanius and Pratto 1993; Wright, Taylor and Moghaddam 1990). Lack of resistance to subtle forms of sexism, however, communicates acquiescence and therefore acceptance of the status quo (Gramsci 1971; Jackman 2001). With regard to the potential victims (in this case, women), more blatant forms of prejudice make it easier to focus negative responses on those who hold prejudicial views instead of worrying about possible shortcomings of the self. Thoughts about such possible shortcomings interfere with behavior that aims to challenge or redress prejudicial expectations (Steele and Aronson 1995). In this sense, our research clearly demonstrates the perils of politically correct expressions of prejudice such as modern sexism (also see Satterfield and Muehlenhard 1997; Windmann and Kruger 1998). 

Our results, however, did not support our prediction of a similar pattern for protest responses regarding derogation of the source. Instead, we found that the intention to protest depended on the source of the discriminatory message. This result also takes us one step further in understanding how people respond to prejudice. That is, we found that when a female expresses negative attitudes towards women, women are more inclined to protest than men, whereas men and women are equally likely to challenge a male‚Äôs sexist views.  This observation is consistent with the view that prototypes guide our perceptions of prejudice and our responses. Indeed, our finding that sexism is detected less easily when expressed by a female agrees with the idea that the prototypical sexist event involves a male perpetrator and a female victim (also see Baron et al. 1991; Locksley et al. 1980). Similarly, in the prototypical scenario for protest against sexism, women challenge men‚Äôs sexist attitudes. As a result, our male participants may have found it awkward to protest against sexist views held by women because such protest would imply a complete reversal of the prototypical situation. The violation of the prototype would be less evident, however, in the case of female participants protesting against other females‚Äô sexist attitudes.
","In this study we examined the responses of male and female research participants to information about the endorsement of either old-fashioned or modern sexist views by a sample of either men or women. We predicted that expressions of modern sexism may seem unobjectionable but can have negative consequences. Moreover, they can impair behavioral responses and therefore remain unchallenged. The results show that female participants in particular were relatively disinclined to recognize expressions of modern sexism as prejudicial. Furthermore, while old-fashioned sexist views generally elicited hostility, exposure to modern sexist opinions evoked anxiety in female participants, while it decreased anxiety among male participants. We conclude that modern forms of prejudice may prove perilous: although they may undermine the self, they seem inoffensive and as a result remain unchallenged.","7",1,"2","Political",2,1
33,5,"Callaway, F., Hardy, M., & Griffiths, T. L. (2023). Optimal nudging for cognitively bounded agents: A framework for modeling, predicting, and controlling the effects of choice architectures. Psychological Review.","In this article, we proposed a formal framework for modeling, constructing, and evaluating nudges. Our approach is based on formulating human decision making in terms of metalevel Markov decision processes. In this framework, nudges change the initial belief state or sequence of deliberative actions taken by a decision maker. This in turn influences their observed choices. While models have traditionally been developed separately for different nudges and contexts (Chetty, 2015; Yeung, 2012), we are able to account for the effects of several nudges in this framework. _x000D_
_x000D_
We tested our framework in five large behavioral experiments. In the first three experiments, we showed how default options, suggested alternatives, and information highlighting, could be formally modeled as changes to the metalevel problem. In each case, this approach allowed us to derive models that replicated findings from applied research, allowing us to unify several verbal theories of specific nudges in a common formal framework. _x000D_
_x000D_
We then showed how our framework for modeling nudging can be used to automatically construct optimal nudges. Our approach identified nudges that were significantly more effective than those identified randomly or by a heuristic. While we chose to optimize metalevel reward, or overall well-being, this approach could easily be extended to optimize other types of nudges, such as those that maximize the probability of making a certain choice or those that reduce deliberation cost without systematically changing behavior. _x000D_
_x000D_
Furthermore, because our optimal nudging procedure is automatic, our approach could be used to extend the concept of personalized nudges (Mills, 2022; Peer et al., 2020; Sch√∂ning et al., 2019; Sunstein, 2013, 2014; Thaler & Tucker, 2013; Yeung, 2017). Traditional approaches to personalizing nudging use past choices or other user data to estimate people‚Äôs preferences, circumstances, and needs. In our framework, one could infer a user‚Äôs preference within a single decision based on observable measures of their decision-making operations (for example, mouse- or eye-tracking). This observation could then be used to update the choice architect‚Äôs beliefs about the user‚Äôs preferences and make more effective nudges. On the other hand, when data privacy is a concern (Mills, 2022), our approach can still be applied without any user data by integrating over all possible preferences as we did in our experiments. Similarly, our approach could automate the construction of self-nudges (Reijula & Hertwig, 2020), or choice architectures that individuals manipulate and design to help improve their own decisions. In our framework, self-nudges could be constructed by allowing individuals to specify the objective of the nudge or the space of possible modifications. This transparency and individual autonomy could potentially address arguments that nudging can be manipulative and paternalistic (Goodwin, 2012; Hausman & Welch, 2010; Wilkinson, 2013). _x000D_
_x000D_
Limitations and Future Directions _x000D_
Despite the advantages, our framework for modeling and designing nudges puts substantial demands on the theorist or choice architect. Specifically, they must provide a detailed model of the computational architecture supporting the relevant decision-making process. Here, we identify three specific challenges related to this issue which should be investigated in future work. _x000D_
_x000D_
The first, and likely most substantial challenge, lies in modeling the cognitive aspects of the computational architecture. In the present work, we largely sidestepped this challenge by using a process-tracing paradigm that externalizes aspects of decision making that typically occur in people‚Äôs heads (i.e., evaluating options on different dimensions). Applying our framework with more realistic cognitive models‚Äîincluding components such as noisy evidence accumulation (Callaway et al., 2021; Noguchi & Stewart, 2018; Roe et al., 2001; Usher & McClelland, 2004) and direct comparison between options (Chen et al., 2021; Howes et al., 2016; Stewart et al., 2006)‚Äîis a critical direction for future research. Indeed, our framework is agnostic to the cognitive model being used, and can generate predictions for any choice where the deliberative process can be formalized as a series of belief-updating deliberative actions. Applying such models to nudging raises the interesting question of how to handle free parameters. Although one could design nudges assuming a distribution of these parameters across a population (as we did for the weight vectors, w), one could also design nudging systems that personalize themselves not only to a decision maker‚Äôs preferences, but also to their idiosyncratic cognitive quirks. _x000D_
_x000D_
A second, related challenge, lies in modeling how the external aspects of the computational architecture (i.e., the choice architecture) are affected by different nudges. In some cases, this may be relatively trivial (e.g., when modeling early vs. late suggestions). Other cases, however, may be less clear. Consider, for example, our model of defaults as providing information about which option is best for most people. This may work well in the context of choosing a publicly backed health care plan, but it may not work well in the context of selecting an upgrade package for a flight (a case when the choice architect and the decision maker have highly divergent goals). Thus, even with our approach, models may still have to be adjusted for different domains and contexts, limiting the potential for full automation. Nevertheless, our approach still greatly constrains the space of possible models and provides a general framework for designing and comparing different possible models of a given nudge. _x000D_
_x000D_
A final challenge lies in characterizing how an individual‚Äôs decision-making strategy will change in response to the altered computational architecture. Consistent with resource-rational analysis, we have here assumed that this adaptation is rational. That is, we assume that people optimally solve the modified metalevel problem. Our results suggest that this assumption is sufficient to produce reasonably accurate predictions about the effects of nudges. However, it is also clear that people are not perfectly rational, even with respect to their limited cognitive resources. Future work should extend our framework to account for more accurate models of how people adapt their mental strategies to new metalevel problems, drawing on research in cognitive architectures (Anderson et al., 1997; Laird et al., 1986), strategy selection (Erev & Barron, 2005; Lieder & Griffiths, 2017; Rieskamp & Otto, 2006; Shrager & Siegler, 1998) and instance-based learning (Bugbee & Gonzalez, 2022; Gonzalez & Aggarwal, 2022). _x000D_
_x000D_
Together, these challenges may significantly limit practical applications of our framework. However, even if the choice architect cannot perfectly specify a model of the computational architecture supporting the deliberation process, our framework may be adequate to make useful, if not highly accurate, predictions. At the very least, our approach identifies novel predictions and nudges that researchers can test in applied domains. _x000D_
_x000D_
Conclusion _x000D_
Nudges have already proven to be a highly effective mechanism for improving the decisions people make. In proposing a formal framework for modeling the effects of choice architecture, we hope to provide insight into how we can design even more effective nudges. In addition to providing a computational tool for predicting the effects of nudges, this framework forces us to confront important questions about what the goals of nudging are. Together, these advances allow us to apply tools from artificial intelligence to automate the design of nudges. We anticipate that this will make it possible to increase the range of contexts in which nudges can be used. More broadly, our approach of understanding nudges as modifications to a decision-maker‚Äôs internal computational environment may have implications for the larger goal of designing interfaces that support human decision maki_x000D_","People‚Äôs decisions often deviate from classical notions of rationality, incurring costs to themselves and society. One way to reduce the costs of poor decisions is to redesign the decision problems people face to encourage better choices. While often subtle, these nudges can have dramatic effects on behavior and are increasingly popular in public policy, health care, and marketing. Although nudges are often designed with psychological theories in mind, they are typically not formalized in computational terms and their effects can be hard to predict. As a result, designing nudges can be difficult and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose a computational framework for understanding and predicting the effects of nudges. Our approach builds on recent work modeling human decision making as adaptive use of limited cognitive resources, an approach called resource-rational analysis. In our framework, nudges change the metalevel problem the agent faces‚Äîthat is, the problem of how to make a decision. This changes the optimal sequence of cognitive operations an agent should execute, which in turn influences their behavior. We show that models based on this framework can account for known effects of nudges based on default options, suggested alternatives, and information highlighting. In each case, we validate the model‚Äôs predictions in an experimental process-tracing paradigm. We then show how the framework can be used to automatically construct optimal nudges, and demonstrate that these nudges improve people‚Äôs decisions more than intuitive heuristic approaches. Overall, our results show that resource-rational analysis is a promising framework for formally characterizing and constructing nudges.","Apolitical",1,"4","Political",3,1

Econometrica, 92: 1553-1588. https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA20942","The previous sections document that random boosts of votes to a party move coalition policies and expenditure towards the most salient policy for the treated party as stated in its electoral manifesto. The analysis of the mechanisms shows that the effect on policies is due to changes in bargaining power within legislative majorities and that the treated parties successfully manage to exploit their larger representation during the process of government formation. When treating parties with political ideologies focusing on specific issues, changes in the partisan composition of the government also come with changes in the appointed cabinet members' socio-demographic features (and latent preferences). Instead, when a party's political manifesto mentions issues more evenly, no effect can be detected on the features of cabinets and policies. When exploring heterogeneous effects, we find, related to the question of the bargaining power of parties vis-√†-vis the mayor in legislative majorities, that the effect of the treatment on policies tends to be larger when parties are confronted with mayors that are politically weaker because they had to face a run-off election, and that are not affiliated with the treated party. Similar patterns can be detected in terms of the partisan composition of the cabinet. The findings broadly align with the view that parties affect policies because of an increased relative bargaining power (see Figure A5)._x000D_

6 Concluding Remarks_x000D_
We have studied the impact of a random reshuffling of votes to parties in the context of a large-scale natural experiment covering the universe of local elections for over a decade in Italy. We show that the electoral rules, a lottery on the order of party symbols, and the peculiar graphical design of ballot papers implied a systematic reallocation of votes within running coalitions. The reallocation of votes is random, pervasive, and non-marginal but, due to the use of the lottery, is independent across coalitions, municipalities, and years._x000D_
_x000D_
Exploiting the natural experiment, the analysis provides evidence that is informative on the long-lasting debate on the role of votes to parties for policy-setting in multi-party representative democracies. We focus attention on the main parties and isolate the effect of empowering each of the parties within ruling coalitions with a boost of votes on the policies implemented by the coalition. The results show that votes to parties imply perturbations of bargaining power within ruling majorities that materialize in sizable changes in primary policies. The effects can be detected when electoral platforms feature salient policy issues and are larger for the more politically divisive issues._x000D_
_x000D_
We explore the chain of mechanisms mapping votes to parties into legislative representation and to the appointment of cabinets. The results show that the capability of parties to shift coalition policies is strictly related to the bargaining process in the context of the formation of governments. Parties leverage their higher electoral support to gain politically affiliated cabinet members appointed to policy departments that are salient for the party. The findings also document that the cabinet members become closer, regarding socio-demographic characteristics, to the typical party-affiliated politician._x000D_","We exploit a natural experiment involving a randomization of votes across parties within coalitions in all local elections in Italy for over a decade. A lottery on the position of party symbols in the ballot papers allows estimating the causal effect of increasing votes to parties for coalition policies. A non-marginal random boost of votes shifts budgetary spending towards the treated party's platform, but only for issues that are salient in that party's political manifesto. We study the chains of mechanisms mapping votes into policies and link it to an increase in bargaining power within legislative majorities. Parties leverage their higher electoral support to gain the appointment of politically affiliated cabinet members. Empowering different parties also leads to the selection of cabinets with different socio-demographic characteristics. The unintentional experiment helps shed new light on mechanisms mapping votes to parties into coalition policies.","4",1,"4","Political",4,0

We disentangle the role of inattention and switching costs, showing how the former plays a key role, and explore heterogeneity along dimensions like income and education._x000D_
_x000D_
Our findings have important policy implication. Consumer choice is a centrepiece of current market regulation policies promoting an increase in competition among suppliers. For instance, to control energy costs, the recently adopted EU energy policy framework Clean Energy for All Europeans requires energy suppliers to provide free access to at least one energy comparison tool and clearer information in household bills.21 As underlined in the literature (Waterson 2003), the impact of such measures is greatly diminished if consumers display a high degree of passivity, as documented in this paper. Our finding that low income/low education is associated with lower attention also raises distributional issues, as people from low socio-economic background appear to be the least likely to benefit from increased choice._x000D_
_x000D_
Similarly, the British energy regulator, Ofgem, has launched a program to address low levels of consumer engagement, testing measures ‚Äúto encourage consumer engagement, promote competition and innovation in the retail energy market‚Äù.22 These measures include a so-called Cheaper Market Offer Communication, contacting customers with better tariff offers by post, or Collective Switch, where, similarly to our setting, customers on a default energy tariff received letters showing personalized savings if they switched from their current deal to an exclusive tariff. All these measures can be effective, but, crucially, require consumers to pay attention, something that, as we show, cannot be taken for granted. It would therefore be important for regulators to add to their toolbox measures aimed directly at increasing attention. For instance, there is a literature showing the importance of word-of-mouth communications, where information is conveyed through personal networks (see, for instance, Duflo and Saez 2003; Banerjee et al. 2013). There could be incentives to encourage engaged consumers to reach out to disengaged ones, along the lines of incentives provided by firms looking for employees (Burks et al. 2015) or in marketing (Aral and Walker 2011; Bapna and Umyarov 2015; Wolters, Schulze, and Gedenk 2020). This would have the advantage of leveraging on trust and direct experience by peers, and could be a promising venue to boost attention. Alternatively, in some contexts, individuals could be forced to make an active choice (see Heiss et al. 2021). For instance, in the context we study, customers could have been required to choose between metered and changeover tariffs, without providing a default. This would have entailed, however, considerable paperwork and possible disruptions in water supply if people failed anyway to comply._x000D_
_x000D_
In contexts in which it is not feasible to reach 100% attention, there is room for policy initiatives aimed at protecting consumers with low propensity to pay attention to tariffs and switch to the most convenient ones. An example of such a policy is the UK Domestic Gas and Electricity (Tariff Cap) Act that requires the energy regulator to design and implement a temporary cap on standard variable tariffs and fixed term default tariffs, entered into force on 1 January 2019 until 2023. As explained in the Ofgem website,23 ‚Äú[t]hese tariffs are an energy supplier‚Äôs basic offer, and tend to apply if you have not shopped around for a better deal. They are typically poorer value and more expensive than a non-default, fixed-term contract deal, which you can choose to switch to. You will often need to renew fixed-term contracts after a year or more. If you have never switched, or not switched for a long time, you are likely to be on one of these tariffs. Over half of all households in Great Britain are on these tariffs because they have never switched or have not done so recently‚Äù. In the context we study, it would have been feasible to automatically apply to each household the most convenient tariff. However, as explained in Section 2, this would have been more expensive and less targeted under the‚Äîex ante reasonable but not validated by our results‚Äîassumption that lower income households were more likely to call._x000D_
_x000D_
Our findings of massive inertia in an environment that should be favorable to consumers taking action suggest that policy interventions should not take consumers‚Äô attention for granted but need to be accompanied by appropriate design choices and specific measures that can raise awareness. Yet, due consideration should be given to the fact that, even after deploying such measures, a non-negligible share of the public may still not pay attention, therefore calling for measures aimed at passive consumers. This is particularly important if, as we show, the most vulnerable part of the population is the most prone to inattention._x000D_","This paper studies consumers‚Äô choice between two different water tariffs. We document a large inaction in a novel setting where customers face a binary decision and receive simple, detailed, and personalized information about the financial savings they would obtain if they were to switch water tariff. Our empirical framework separates two sources of inertia: inattention and switching costs. The model estimates that half of the customers that would benefit from changing tariff are not aware of the opportunity they are offered. Conditional on paying attention, we estimate median switching costs to be around ¬£100. A model where all customers are assumed to pay attention delivers instead implausibly high switching costs, with a median of ¬£400. This shows the importance of inattention in explaining consumers‚Äô inaction. Looking at the characteristics of the households, our results confirm previous findings that areas where households have higher levels of education or the proportion of minorities is lower display a higher responsiveness to potential savings. The new insight offered by our analysis is that this is entirely driven by attention, whereas switching costs actually increase with education and ethnic homogeneity. Our findings suggest that policies aimed at increasing attention can play a central role in fostering competition among suppliers and reducing inequalities.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Political",3,0

5.1. Attitudes toward Government
To analyze attitudes toward government, we use data from the American National Election Studies (ANES), an opinion survey on voting attitudes and behavior. To increase sample size and since some of the questions of interest are asked only in some years, we pooled all available waves from 1948 to 2012. We constructed several indicators ranging from trust in government to interest in elections. The details on how the variables have been constructed and the years for which they are available are reported in Table A.4 in Appendix A. We then match information on the state of residence of respondents in the ANES with our discrimination index and estimate the following regression:
Yi=Œ±+Œ≤1DiscriminationIndexs+Œ≤2Blacki+Œ≤3Blacki√óDiscriminationIndexs+Xi‚Ä≤Œ≥+Œµi, (2)

where Y is the outcome of interest (e.g., faith in government) of individual i, DiscriminationIndex is the discrimination index at the state level derived from our data (as described in Section 4.3) and Black is a variable equal to 1 if the respondent‚Äôs reported race is black and 0 if it is white. X is a vector that includes the following control variables: sex, age, education, marital status, social class, occupation, work status, race-specific year dummies and four indicators for the region of residence. The coefficient of interest is Œ≤3, which represents how the white-black gap in the outcome of interest varies with our measure of discrimination in local public services. The results of this analysis are reported in Table 10.

The outcome in column (1) is an indicator that is equal to one if the individual has most faith in local government and zero if the individual has most faith in state/federal government. The second column considers a similar outcome, but individuals are asked about the level of government in which they have least trust. The estimates of Œ≤3 for both regressions indicate that the white-black gap in terms of faith in local government (compared to other levels of government) is larger in states where discrimination in public services is higher, albeit results are statistically significant at the 10% level only in column (1).

The outcomes in columns (3)‚Äì(5) capture individuals‚Äô subjective rating of government‚Äôs performance. We consider all levels of government (local/state/federal) and construct an indicator that is equal to 1 if the rating is above the median and 0 otherwise. The point estimates of Œ≤3 suggest that African Americans have an even lower rating of government performance if they reside in states where the value of the discrimination index is higher. However, coefficient estimates are statistically significant for local and federal governments only.

Next, we consider individuals‚Äô opinions about how much the government pays attention to what people think. The outcome variable is defined as 1 if the individual thinks that the government is not paying sufficient attention and 0 otherwise. Estimates suggest that while African Americans living in states where discrimination in public services is low are less likely to report a negative opinion, the opposite happens for those living in states with higher discrimination. However, the estimate of Œ≤3 is not statistically significant.

Finally, we consider the link between discrimination in local public services and voting attitudes and behavior by using an indicator that equals 1 if individuals are not interested in elections and 0 otherwise. The estimate of Œ≤3 is positive and statistically significant at conventional values, suggesting that in states with higher discrimination, African Americans are more likely to show lower political interest.25

5.2. Racial Wage Gap
To look at racial wage gap, we use data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) for individuals aged 16‚Äì64 in full-time employment. In Table 11 we relate log weekly wages to race and the discrimination index. What emerges is that African Americans earn less, both overall and looking at subsamples characterized by gender or education (above/below high school). The interactions between the black dummy and our index are all negative, indicating that the gap is wider in states displaying higher discrimination. The coefficient of the interaction is however significant only for the low-education subsample.

Overall, in this Section we find that our measure of discrimination has some correlation with attitudes toward government and racial wage gaps, with states characterized by higher discrimination displaying more negative attitudes toward government by African Americans, as well as wider wage gaps.

6. Conclusions
We carry out an email correspondence study that aims to identify whether racial discrimination exists in the provision of information regarding public services offered by local offices in the United States (school districts, libraries, sheriff offices, treasurers, job centers and county clerks). Overall, we find that requests of information coming from a person with a distinctively black name are less likely to receive a reply than those from a person with a distinctively white name. In our context, statistical discrimination is unlikely to be of first order importance and a series of tests indeed points toward the role of animus in explaining our findings.

Besides being illegal, discrimination by public service providers is particularly startling, since governments could be major players in the effort to eradicate discrimination in American society. For instance, school districts and libraries can play an important role in closing the educational achievement gap of black children. Indeed, our interest in the local level government relates to the fact that low-level bureaucrats are responsible for the implementation of policy enacted at both the federal and state level.

One criticism of correspondence studies in the labor market is that these analyses may not measure labor market discrimination that blacks experience in equilibrium. The explanation is that blacks may respond to the presence of discrimination by sorting themselves across firms (e.g., minimizing their contact with the most discriminatory ones) or adopting different job-search strategies than whites (e.g., sending more resum√©s, see Charles and Guryan 2011). This is less of an issue in the case of local public services, since providers are local monopolies in many cases. Thus, residents of a given locality cannot usually choose with which school district or sheriff office to interact. It is indeed true that black citizens may respond to the differential treatment that we have uncovered by becoming more vocal in asking public officials to fulfill their duties (for instance, by sending more ‚Äúreminders‚Äù to unresponsive offices). However, this entails a cost, both psychologically and in terms of time. Moreover, besides ‚Äúvoice‚Äù, there is the alternative option of ‚Äúexit‚Äù (Hirschman 1970), whereby black citizens who feel discriminated by public offices may reduce their interaction with them as much as possible, with potentially high costs in terms of the foregone consumption of public services. In our settings, we cannot investigate which type of reaction prevails. However, the analysis in the previous Section showed that discrimination is associated with less engagement with government (as measured by interest in elections).

Overcoming discriminatory practices in local public services is a complex issue. The persistence of such practices despite their illegality suggests that they will not be eradicated through a quick legislative fix. Possible interventions include hiring policies aimed at increasing diversity among the workforce or promoting racial matching between employees and the communities they serve (Lang 2015). At the practical level, instituting modes of communication with citizens that do not disclose the name of the sender (e.g., through online forms) rather than through emails could also be useful. What this paper shows is that discriminatory practices are present in terms of access to public services and that policy makers should consider such interventions.","We examine whether racial discrimination exists in access to public services in the United States. We carry out an email correspondence study in which we pose simple queries to more than 19,000 local public service providers. We find that emails from putatively black senders are almost 4 percentage points less likely to receive an answer compared to emails signed with a white-sounding name. Moreover, responses to queries coming from black names are less likely to have a cordial tone. Further tests suggest that the differential in the likelihood of answering is due to animus toward blacks rather than inferring socioeconomic status from race. Finally, we show that attitudes toward the government among blacks are more negative in states with higher discrimination.","1",0,"1","Political",2,0

American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, 6 (2): 198‚Äì230. DOI: 10.1257/pol.6.2.198","Noncompetitive influences on public sector pay have been long debated. On the one hand, the lack of a competitive market, the presence and continuing strength of public sector labor unions, and the high level of political involvement of these unions all suggest that public sector workers can influence their pay. On the other hand, public sector pay (and employment) decisions are not made in a vacuum, as taxpayers can migrate away from locations in which public goods and services are provided in an excessively costly fashion, limiting the potential for rent extraction. However, residents who enjoy the beaches and sunshine of southern California, or who benefit from the higher productivity of dense urban areas like Manhattan, are reluctant to leave, giving public sector workers more leeway to extract rents in such high-amenity places. _x000D_
_x000D_
The data bear out this connection between amenities and rent-seeking behavior. In estimating standard log wage regressions, we find that public sector wage differentials are in fact larger in the presence of strong amenities, as are the absolute levels of public sector wages. The results are the same whether we look at state or local public sector workers, and they also emerge when we look at important subsets of these workers who receive much attention in the debate over public sector pay‚Äîteachers and prison guards. Furthermore, the relationship between public sector wage differentials and amenities is stronger for unionized public sector workers, consistent with their greater ability to extract rents through both organization and influence over the political process. Moreover, among unionized workers, this relationship is stronger in states with extensive collective bargaining. The data also pass a falsification test since we find no evidence of a connection between amenities and wage differentials for federal workers. _x000D_
_x000D_
Despite our compelling evidence, the paper by no means offers a ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù theory of public sector wage determination. The productivity of public sector workers matters, as does the level of alternative wages they can earn in the private sector, a factor not included in our stylized model. Developing a fuller understanding of these various influences on public sector wages can clarify the policy debate on public sector pay and may prove useful in considering possible reforms to reduce rent extraction by public sector workers. _x000D_
_x000D_
In principle, our approach could be extended to analyze differences in fringe benefits between the private and public sectors. Studying the connection between benefits and amenities may be particularly informative in light of recent concerns over public sector pensions. Finally, the same considerations regarding rent extraction and amenities may apply to other workers who are not necessarily concentrated in the public sector but whose pay is strongly influenced by government regulations, political power (in part through unionization), and other noncompetitive forces. More generally, a similar story may apply to any group that attempts to use political influence to achieve goals that impose costs on other taxpayers. High levels of amenities may impede the taxpayer mobility that otherwise constrains raiding the public till. _x000D_
_x000D_
Although the phenomenon analyzed in this paper is mostly beyond the reach of public policy, one possible policy implication comes from our results on the effect of collective bargaining laws. Since we showed that a favorable collective bargaining environment is especially conducive to higher public sector pay in high-amenity states, stronger collective bargaining laws might be expected to notably raise costs of operating the public sector in such states, while weaker laws would be especially effective in reducing these costs._x000D_","Rent extraction by public sector workers may be limited by the ability of taxpayers to vote with their feet. But rent extraction may be higher in regions where high amenities mute the migration response. This paper develops a theoretical model that predicts such a link between public sector wage differentials and local amenities, and the predictions are tested by analyzing variation in these differentials and amenities across states. Public sector wage differentials are, in fact, larger in the presence of high amenities, with the effect stronger for unionized public sector workers, whose political power may allow greater scope for rent extraction.","7",0,"7","Political",6,1
38,6,"Gordon Dahl, Stefano DellaVigna, Does Movie Violence Increase Violent Crime?, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Volume 124, Issue 2, May 2009, Pages 677‚Äì734, https://doi.org/10.1162/qjec.2009.124.2.677","We have provided causal evidence on the short-run effect of exposure to media violence on violent crime. We exploit the natural experiment induced by time-series variation in the violence of movies at the box office. We show that exposure to violent movies has three main effects on violent crime: (i) it significantly reduces violent crime in the evening on the day of exposure; (ii) by an even larger percent, it reduces violent crime during the night hours following exposure; (iii) it has no significant impact in the days and weeks following the exposure. We interpret the first finding as voluntary incapacitation: potential criminals that choose to attend the movie theater forego other activities that have higher crime rates. As simple as this finding is, it has been neglected in the literature, despite its quantitative importance. _x000D_
_x000D_
We interpret the second finding as substitution away from a night of more volatile activities, in particular, a reduction in alcohol consumption. The third finding implies that the same-day impact on crime is not offset by intertemporal substitution of crime. An important component of these interpretations is the sorting of more violent individuals into violent movie attendance. _x000D_
_x000D_
These findings appear to contradict evidence from laboratory experiments that document an increase in violent behavior following exposure to movie violence. However, the field and laboratory findings are not contradictory. Exposure to movie violence can lower violent behavior relative to the foregone alternative activity (the field finding), even if it increases violent behavior relative to exposure to nonviolent movies (the laboratory finding). In fact, we document suggestive evidence that, after accounting for selection, violent movies induce more violent crime relative to nonviolent movies, consistent with an arousal effect. This example suggests that other apparent discrepancies between laboratory and field studies (see Levitt and List [2007]) might be reconciled if differences in treatment and setup are taken into account. In addition, the field evidence provides a bound for the laboratory finding of an arousal effect, which we estimate in the field to be one-third as large as the time-use effect. _x000D_
_x000D_
Given that movie attendance occupies a significant portion of leisure time use, our findings imply first-order welfare effects. We can calculate the change in assaults that would occur if the audience of violent movies did not go to the movies but instead engaged in their next best alternative. The total number of evening and nighttime assaults prevented is 997 assaults per weekend, adding up to almost 52,000 weekend assaults prevented yearly.14 With an estimated (in year 2007 dollars) direct monetary cost of $2,217 and an estimated intangible quality-of-life cost of $11,154 per assault (Miller, Cohen, and Wiersema 1996), this implies a benefit of roughly $695 million each year. Our estimates suggest that a strongly violent blockbuster movie such as Hannibal (with 10.1 million viewers on opening weekend) reduced assaults by 1,056 on its opening weekend, which amounts to a 5.2% decrease in assaults, about half the impact of the reduction in crime due to a cold day. This substantial short-term impact of violent movies had been overlooked by the previous literature. _x000D_
_x000D_
Of course, if strongly violent movies were banned as a matter of public policy, our estimated short-term effects could be offset partly if studios respond by producing more mildly violent movies. The degree to which this would temper our findings depends on how substitutable strongly and mildly violent movies are for each other. This substitution, however, is likely to be imperfect; a regression of strongly violent movie attendance on mildly violent movie attendance (including all the baseline controls of Table III) yields a coefficient of ‚àí.196 (s.e. .028). This implies that there will be substantial substitution to other nonmovie activities as well, and our empirical results suggest that these nonmovie activities are more conducive to violent behavior. _x000D_
_x000D_
In the paper, we find no impact of violent movies in the days and weeks following exposure. Still, our design (like the laboratory experiments) cannot address the important question about the long-run effect of exposure to movie violence. As such, this paper does not provide evidence on the long-term effects of a policy limiting the level of violence allowed in the media. However, it does indicate that in the short run these policies will likely increase violent crime, because they induce substitution toward more dangerous activities. _x000D_
_x000D_
Finally, a central point of our paper is that the merits of any particular activity must be viewed relative to the next best activity in utility terms. As such, our findings are relevant beyond the case of movies. For example, violent video games may well increase aggression, but they also incapacitate potential offenders for a substantial period of time. More generally, we hypothesize that other activities with a controlled, alcohol-free environment that attract young men, such as Midnight Basketball, should also reduce crime in the short run._x000D_","Laboratory experiments in psychology find that media violence increases aggression in the short run. We analyze whether media violence affects violent crime in the field. We exploit variation in the violence of blockbuster movies from 1995 to 2004, and study the effect on same-day assaults. We find that violent crime decreases on days with larger theater audiences for violent movies. The effect is partly due to voluntary incapacitation: between 6 p.m. and 12 a.m., a one million increase in the audience for violent movies reduces violent crime by 1.1% to 1.3%. After exposure to the movie, between 12 a.m. and 6 a.m., violent crime is reduced by an even larger percent. This finding is explained by the self-selection of violent individuals into violent movie attendance, leading to a substitution away from more volatile activities. In particular, movie attendance appears to reduce alcohol consumption. The results emphasize that media exposure affects behavior not only via content, but also because it changes time spent in alternative activities. The substitution away from more dangerous activities in the field can explain the differences with the laboratory findings. Our estimates suggest that in the short run, violent movies deter almost 1,000 assaults on an average weekend. Although our design does not allow us to estimate long-run effects, we find no evidence of medium-run effects up to three weeks after initial exposure.","4",0,"4","Political",4,0

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 120(36), e2222103120. https://doi.org/doi:10.1073/pnas.2222103120 ","The current studies revealed not only the impact of a one-time unconditional cash transfer of $7,500 on individuals experiencing homelessness in the context of a higher-income country but also a mistrust in the public toward these individuals in their ability to manage money, and constructive messaging to improve public support for a cash transfer policy by highlighting the benefits of the cash transfer to the recipients themselves and society. The findings from Study 1 were consistent with past cash transfer studies in lower-income countries in that overall spending increased but without increased temptation goods spending after the cash transfer (13, 42). However, the findings were inconsistent with past studies as the cash transfer had limited impact on cognitive function and subjective well-being on these individuals, presumably because $7,500 was relatively a small amount of money in Vancouver, Canada, representing 12% of the average annual personal income, whereas the average cash transfer in lower-income countries was relatively larger, representing 37% annual personal income (19). Another contextual factor was that the cash transfer study took place during the development of modular housing in Vancouver, which may have facilitated cash recipients finding stable housing. Given that most of the analyses were exploratory, the cash transfer intervention should be repeated in future studies._x000D_
_x000D_
The current findings are important for a number of reasons. First, this work suggests that cash transfers may offer a cost-effective solution to combat homelessness for recently homeless individuals without severe substance use, alcohol use, or psychiatric symptoms. Building upon existing social supports, this approach may help individuals get out of homelessness by providing choice and freedom to make their own decisions to meet their own needs. While cash transfers are not a panacea, they may speed the path to stability and can be integrated easily with existing social supports. Second, this work suggests that the current workshop and coaching supports provide little benefits to individuals experiencing homelessness. This calls for future work to explore which supports can be paired with cash to benefit individuals experiencing homelessness given their needs. Third, our study adds to growing global evidence demonstrating the benefits of cash transfers to low-income populations (25, 49). By demonstrating potential impact for reducing homelessness, this work opens up new avenues for research with other marginalized groups (e.g., youth aging out of foster care, people exiting prisons) and other types of transfers (e.g., $10k, guaranteed basic income). Finally, the last two experiments demonstrated how to overcome public resistance to cash transfer policy due to people‚Äôs mistrust in recipient spending on temptation goods. To reduce the resistance, policy support can be bolstered by showing counter-stereotypical or utilitarian benefits of the cash transfer, as shown in the final experiment. Thus, the current findings provide useful guidelines on garnering public support for policies that aim to raise the income floor for the homeless population. While the results are preliminary and need to be replicated with confirmatory research, this study provides proof of concept for the provision of cash assistance for individuals experiencing homelessness. As more countries around the world have embraced cash assistance to help individuals cope with economic hardships, the time has never been better to extend these benefits for those most in need._x000D_","Homelessness is an economic and social crisis. In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, we address a core cause of homelessness‚Äîlack of money‚Äîby providing a one-time unconditional cash transfer of CAD$7,500 to each of 50 individuals experiencing homelessness, with another 65 as controls in Vancouver, BC. Exploratory analyses showed that over 1 y, cash recipients spent fewer days homeless, increased savings and spending with no increase in temptation goods spending, and generated societal net savings of $777 per recipient via reduced time in shelters. Additional experiments revealed public mistrust toward the ability of homeless individuals to manage money and demonstrated interventions to increase public support for a cash transfer policy using counter-stereotypical or utilitarian messaging. Together, this research offers a new approach to address homelessness and provides insights into homelessness reduction policies.","1",0,"1","Political",2,0
40,7,"Vlasceanu, M., Doell, K., Bak-Coleman, J., & Van Bavel, J. J. (2023). Addressing Climate Change with Behavioral Science: A Global Intervention Tournament in 63 Countries. ","In a global megastudy conducted on a sample of 59,440 people from 63 countries, we empirically assessed the relative effectiveness of 11 expert-crowdsourced, theoretically derived behavioral interventions at stimulating climate mitigation beliefs and behaviors (i.e., climate change beliefs, policy support, willingness to share information, and tree-planting contributions). We found that different interventions tended to have small global effects, which varied across outcomes and largely affected nonskeptics, emphasizing the importance of examining the impact of climate interventions on a range of outcomes before drawing conclusions regarding their overarching relative efficacy. These findings suggest that the impact of behavioral climate interventions varies across audiences‚Äô characteristics and target behaviors._x000D_
_x000D_
Here, climate change beliefs were strengthened most by decreasing the psychological distance of climate change. Support for climate change mitigation policy was increased mostly by writing a letter to be read in the future by a socially close child, describing one‚Äôs current climate change mitigation actions. Willingness to share climate change information on social media was increased most by inducing negative emotions through ‚Äúdoom and gloom‚Äù‚Äìstyled messaging about the consequences of climate change. Last, while half of the tested interventions had no effect on the effortful tree-planting behavior, the other half of the interventions reduced the number of trees participants planted. Beyond revealing the utility of harnessing a multioutcome approach, these results also highlight the need for tailoring interventions to target outcomes._x000D_
_x000D_
Our findings extend prior work and are theoretically informative in several ways. Notably, these findings help reconcile several theoretical debates in the literature. For example, some have argued in favor of using a doom and gloom messaging style in climate communications (i.e., induce negative emotions) as a way to stimulate climate mitigation behaviors (42). For instance, recent work found that online news consumption is largely driven by the negative content of the news (43). However, others have warned that this messaging may have no impact on behavior (44) or, worse, that it may depress and demoralize the public into inaction (45). Here, we found empirical support for both accounts on different outcomes: While negative emotion messaging was highly effective at stimulating climate information‚Äìsharing intentions (a relatively low-effort behavior), it decreased tree-planting efforts. Further, the negative emotion induction intervention appeared to backfire on policy support among participants with low initial climate beliefs. These results suggest that climate scientists should carefully consider the differential effects of the prevalent fear-inducing writing styles on different proclimate outcomes. Moreover, it suggests that theoretical models need to explain divergent patterns across outcomes._x000D_
_x000D_
The results also indicate that the impact of the interventions on each outcome depends on peoples‚Äô preexisting belief in climate change, supporting the claim that interventions need to be tailored to the characteristics of their audience (44, 45). For belief, the effectiveness of several interventions (e.g., decreasing the psychological distance and collective action efficacy) was maximized among the uncertain, with lesser effects among believers and skeptics. For policy support, however, interventions were generally only effective among those with high initial levels of belief, with negative emotions backfiring among skeptics. Similarly, the robust increases in willingness to share on social media were largely restricted to people who already believed in climate change‚Äîwith negative emotions increasing sharing intentions even among skeptics. For the higher effort behavior, however, interventions appeared to uniformly reduce tree planting across all levels of initial belief._x000D_
_x000D_
Given the heterogeneity of these results across outcomes, we created a web tool resource (https://climate-interventions.shinyapps.io/climate-interventions/) that can easily and rapidly assess intervention efficacy across each of the four outcomes and across a range of variables, including country, political ideology, gender, age, socioeconomic status, income, and education. While we caution that users must take into account the sample sizes when exploring subsamples of the data and the fact that they are looking at percentage of change compared to the control condition, this web tool can be used as a rapid and intuitive way to query intervention efficacy within subsamples of interest. For example, for highly educated conservatives in the United States, the top intervention to increase climate policy support was the future self-continuity intervention, increasing support by 18%. This intervention also increased climate beliefs in Russian participants by 9%. The scientific consensus intervention increased climate policy support by 9% in Romania but decreased it by 5% in Canada. The binding moral foundations intervention increased the number of trees planted by Australians under the age of 40 by 40%, and by Gambians by 35%, but this intervention decreased the number of trees planted by wealthy Japanese participants by 24%. These results can inform the development of local intervention strategies, which should then be empirically validated. Critically, these results also bolster the message that interventions need to be tailored to the characteristics of the target audience, nationality being an important factor. The accompanying data exploration web tool and the open-source raw dataset contribute to the data-as-public-good trend emerging in the spirit of open science, thus facilitating the testing of additional hypotheses and advancement of science._x000D_
_x000D_
In a linked forecasting experiment (46), academics (e.g., behavioral scientists) and the general public were asked to predict how each intervention would affect belief, policy support, and the tree-planting behavior in a subset of participants from this study (i.e., those from the United States). While academics were better than the general public at predicting the efficacy of these interventions on beliefs and policy support, when compared to statistical models using simple heuristics such as ‚Äúinterventions would have no effect,‚Äù no group was able to accurately predict how interventions would affect behavior. These results suggest that our findings here reflect an important departure from the expectations within the academic community._x000D_
_x000D_
There are also several limitations and future directions that should be emphasized. First, the sampling procedures differed between countries (e.g., the U.S. and Israel samples matched the census on age, gender, region, ethnicity; and the Norway sample matched on age, gender, ethnicity; etc.; Table 1Opens in image viewer). It should be noted that 73.6% of the entire sample was matched for at least one variable. However, despite these differences, recent work has found that representative samples are not required to obtain generalizable estimates of effect sizes within countries (47, 48). Various analyses have highlighted that convenience samples are adequate for estimating treatment effects (49, 50). Hence, given that our paper is primarily concerned with the effects of these interventions rather than with estimating levels of opinion within each country, our sampling procedures were appropriate for the analyses and conclusions drawn here. However, while realizing that it will be a challenge, we encourage future work to examine these processes using larger, more representative samples from an even broader sample of countries._x000D_
_x000D_
Second, we leveraged an online survey‚Äìbased approach, which means that we were able to capture a limited set of contextual factors that may have influenced our results. This approach was the most effective way to measure and compare intervention efficacy in such a diverse global sample. However, one important and potentially impactful avenue for future research could be to leverage these findings to conduct local field experimentation in targeted samples._x000D_
_x000D_
One of the major strengths of our tournament was testing 11 different interventions simultaneously in a large global sample across multiple outcomes. Given the heterogeneity in the effectiveness of the interventions across the outcomes, future work should likewise prioritize testing promising interventions on even more climate-relevant antecedents and outcomes for a more comprehensive assessment of climate interventions and their underlying theoretical frameworks. One constraint we faced when attempting to test additional theories was the decision to not use deception in our interventions. For example, descriptive or injunctive norm‚Äìbased interventions would have needed to be based on deception to be included in and deployed at this global scale, given the unavailability of the empirical information critical to creating these interventions. We hope that the current dataset can provide this information for future research in international contexts. Future work should also investigate additional proenvironmental behaviors, such as investment decisions, activism, advocacy, or civic participation, critical to climate change mitigation._x000D_
_x000D_
Future research should also assess the processes behind the negative effects we observed on the tree-planting task. Here, we find evidence for a trade-off between time spent on the intervention and in the behavioral task, but additional processes may also be at play. For instance, the negative effects observed might suggest a negative spillover process, by which increasing some mitigation actions (e.g., policy support, social media sharing, etc.) could have decreased other mitigation actions (e.g., contributing to tree planting). Given that the tree-planting task was also the last outcome variable completed by participants, such a process could be plausible. However, each of the first three outcomes (i.e., climate belief, climate policy support, and information-sharing willingness) was positively associated with the last outcome (i.e., WEPT; fig. S2 and tables S13 to S15). These positive associations at the study level also held within each of the 12 conditions (tables S16 to S18). That is, the more a participant supported climate policy, the more trees they planted, a pattern found under each condition (table S17). Similarly, participants who were willing to share climate information on social media also planted more trees, again a pattern found under each condition (table S18). These positive associations are more consistent with a positive spillover._x000D_
_x000D_
An alternative explanation for the intervention effects on the tree-planting task could be that current behavioral science theories and their corresponding interventions are more effective at targeting conceptual processes compared to more effortful and time-consuming behavioral signatures, especially in such a heterogeneous global sample. However, another explanation could be that interventions that made the negative consequences of climate change more salient (e.g., negative emotions, decreasing in psychological distance, and future self-continuity), triggered the perception that individual-level solutions (e.g., planting trees) may be futile in the face of such an insurmountable phenomenon, in line with the learned helplessness hypothesis (45). On the other hand, perhaps, a combination of these explanations gave rise to the effects observed. Future research is needed to clarify these processes and identify interventions that increase more effortful climate actions around the world, as well as actions that are more effective solutions to the climate crisis (30)._x000D_
_x000D_
Last, while, in this global study, we tested the effects of several theoretically derived behavioral interventions on people‚Äôs beliefs and actions in the context of climate change, our findings provide meaningful insights to the broader fields of social and behavioral sciences. For instance, the average global effects of the interventions tested ranged from effectively zero to very small in the conceptual outcomes (beliefs and policy support) and near zero to negative in the behavioral outcome (tree planting). These findings point to critical limitations in these theories‚Äô utility and generalizability beyond the contexts in which they were developed. The most extreme example is the correcting pluralistic ignorance intervention, which had no effect on beliefs, policy support, or willingness to share information on social media and even reduced tree-planting efforts. Theories are often tested and evaluated mainly on their ability to account for decontextualized patterns of data in laboratory settings, rather than their ability to help solve societal problems (51). In response to this limitation, researchers have recently proposed reverting the scientific paradigm to an impact-oriented theoretical and empirical research agenda (30)._x000D_
_x000D_
The small effect sizes we observed in this global sample might also be partly interpreted through the lens of recent work reporting that over 60% of studies in the most prestigious journals in psychology have only focused on 11% of the world‚Äôs population (52). In our data collected in the United States or other WEIRD nations, the effects of the top interventions on belief and policy support were much stronger than at the global level. The skewed representation in the field may pose another notable obstacle in addressing societal problems that depend on global cooperation and a diversity of solutions for different cultural contexts, as is the case in climate change among numerous others global crises. One promising solution to these generalizability and practicality limitations in the behavioral sciences relies on embracing international collaborative science. Large global scientific projects can benefit from access to not only a wider range of populations but also from a diversity of scientific perspectives. For example, crowdsourcing has been found to improve the quality of scientific investigations by promoting ideation, inclusiveness, transparency, rigor, and reliability among other factors (25). Thus, crowdsourcing decisions related to the experimental design from experts more widely representative of the global scientific community might increase the impact and generalizability of scientific investigations. For example, the crowdsourcing of the theories tested from our large international team has led us to include less established interventions, such as ‚Äúletter to future generation,‚Äù which ended up being one of the top interventions tested. Future work could also consider extending this crowdsourcing paradigm to include nonexperts (e.g., lay audiences), as recent work suggests that there may be unique benefits (e.g., increased interdisciplinarity), sometimes even producing research questions that outperform experts‚Äô suggestions (53). Last, combining this ‚Äúmany labs‚Äù approach (24) with the megastudy approach (18) promises to push the limits of conventional scientific practices and overcome some of the main barriers of science generalization and implementation (17)._x000D_
_x000D_
Overall, we tested the effectiveness of 11 expert-crowdsourced behavioral interventions at increasing climate awareness and action in 63 countries. Our findings provide theoretical support for many of the tested interventions. However, variation in effectiveness across outcomes, between countries, and along the spectrum of climate beliefs, suggests substantial gaps in our current theoretical understanding of climate change behavior. Moreover, the high preexisting levels of belief and policy support, alongside the small effect sizes observed here, raise critical questions about the practical capacity to facilitate bottom-up change at a global level, suggesting that top-down change might need to be prioritized to achieve the emissions reduction necessary to stay within safe planetary limits for human civilization. Practically, these findings provide critical information to policymakers considering climate solution implementations, streamlining the behavioral sciences‚Äô response to the climate crisis._x000D_","Effectively reducing climate change requires marked, global behavior change. However, it is unclear which strategies are most likely to motivate people to change their climate beliefs and behaviors.

Across 59,440 participants from 63 countries, the interventions‚Äô effectiveness was small, largely limited to nonclimate skeptics, and differed across outcomes: Beliefs were strengthened mostly by decreasing psychological distance (by 2.3%), policy support by writing a letter to a future-generation member (2.6%), information sharing by negative emotion induction (12.1%), and no intervention increased the more effortful behavior‚Äîseveral interventions even reduced tree planting.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 120(16), e2217551120. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2217551120 ","Our research reveals that even consistently replicating results as in refs. 5‚Äì7 and our Study 5 does not necessarily mean that those results represent robust insights. Instead, they may merely be artifacts or confounds of contextual circumstances and insufficient triangulation with multiple approaches (7, 10). Focusing on the original dependent variable: Appropriateness of the agent‚Äôs decision (Tables 1 and 2, second last column) and comparing the previous work to our two conceptual replication studies most similar to the previously published research (our joint evaluation Study 1b and our separate evaluation Study 4; in particular, see gray-highlighted condition rows) suggest that the choice of recruitment platform may have contributed to the differing results. In fact, the sensitivity to recruitment platforms is already somewhat apparent in ref. 5, where the large-sized experiment aversion observed with respondents from Amazon‚Äôs Mechanical Turk in its Study 5a (d = ‚àí0.64, P < 0.001) is reduced to a nonsignificant small effect with US mobile device users recruited from Pollfish in its Study 5b (d = ‚àí0.15, P = 0.056). And indeed, previous work has documented platform differences among others in participants‚Äô attention, comprehension, reliability, and behavior (e.g., refs. 18, 19). It is also possible that what one would assume to be minor tweaks in scenario language given the persistence of the previously published results (such as a small number of changes to further enhance respondents‚Äô understanding of the presented options) contributed to our differing findings, which would further undermine the proposition that there exists a general and robust pattern of behavior representing relative experiment aversion._x000D_
_x000D_
Our research additionally reveals that as part of triangulation, it may be useful to consider various operationalizations of assessing people‚Äôs views, the latter of which is particularly important when there is no obvious one correct measure, and the goal is to establish whether there exists a genuine tendency in people‚Äôs responses. For example, other justifiable ways to measure views toward experiments include asking participants to consider how likely they themselves would be to choose to be exposed to each of the policies (as we have done) and eliciting participants‚Äô willingness to publicly vote for an approach or support it financially. In addition, Meyer et al. (5) interpret their findings, which are based on respondents‚Äô ratings of the appropriateness of an agent‚Äôs decision, as expressions of moral concerns (see p. 10727). However, we find that ratings of more nuanced dimensions such as the ethicality of the agent‚Äôs decision are viewed as somewhat different from the appropriateness question._x000D_
_x000D_
In sum, our findings indicate that there appears to be no generalizable or robust empirical evidence for the existence of relative experiment aversion (i.e., a general pattern whereby people anomalously tend to judge a randomized experiment comparing two unobjectionable policies, neither of which is known to be clearly superior, as worse than simply implementing its individual policies‚Ä°). Our findings are in opposition to those of Meyer et al. (5, 6) and Heck et al. (7) and instead closely align with those of Mislavsky et al.‚Äôs (9) critical condition account. Thus, we arrive at the same conclusion as Mislavsky et al. (9) did for companies: Policymakers may not need to be concerned about using evidence-based practice more so than about universally implementing individual policies. In addition, we conclude that whenever communicating a policy, it is useful to remember that there is no ‚Äúneutral‚Äù language, and policymakers can and should be mindful of their communication choices and perhaps even test them._x000D_","Over the past decade, governments and organizations around the world have established behavioral insights teams advocating for randomized experiments.

The authors warn that this could cause policymakers to avoid running large-scale field experiments or being transparent about running them and might contribute to an adverse heterogeneity bias in terms of who is participating in experiments. In one direct and six conceptual preregistered replications (total N = 5,200) of the previously published larger-effect studies, using the same main dependent variable but with variations in scenario wordings, recruitment platforms, and countries, and the addition of further measures to assess people‚Äôs views, we test the generalizability and robustness of these findings. Together, we find that the original results do not appear to generalize. That is, our triangulation reveals insufficient evidence to conclude that people exhibit a common pattern of behavior that would be consistent with relative experiment aversion, thereby supporting recent findings by R. Mislavsky, B. Dietvorst, U. Simonsohn, Mark. Sci. 39, 1092‚Äì1104 (2020). Thus, policymakers may not need to be concerned about employing evidence-based practices more so than about universally implementing policies.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Political",4,0

Nature. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04452-3 ","These results suggest that people sometimes overlook the asymmetry that exists with known strangers. Future research will need to examine when people can recognize these asymmetries and when they overlook them. However, these findings indicate that our sense of anonymity can depend not just on what people know about us but also on what we know about them._x000D_

Putting the policing intervention in context, a recent meta-analysis found that hotspot policing tactics that increase the police presence in an area reduce crime by 0.11‚Äâs.d. on average25. Without increasing police presence, our intervention reduces on-campus and near-campus crime by 0.14‚Äâs.d. and 0.17‚Äâs.d., respectively, within the first 3 months post-intervention. These effects are short-lived, but fade-out is also common among other hotspot policing strategies26,27._x000D_
_x000D_
These findings shed light on one aspect of community policing strategies. To the extent that these strategies allow residents to learn more about officers (even if not an intentional focus of these policies), the known stranger effect could be a mechanism behind observed crime impacts. This may be one reason why door-to-door visits from officers are more effective at reducing crime than other components of community policing such as neighbourhood watches or storefront offices26,27,28. In addition, because sharing information about officers can be easily implemented, it seems feasible to integrate this approach into many existing policing strategies._x000D_
_x000D_
There is certainly no panacea for important policy challenges such as policing. Broader reforms are necessary to reduce disparities and to increase trust in policing29,30,31. There are also questions about whether residents actually benefit from a focus on policing as the primary lever for crime prevention32. Yet, however community members and policymakers decide on acceptable levels of policing (versus other social services and policies), there may be ways to reduce crime without increasing the number of potentially fraught officer‚Äìcitizen interactions. One way to do that might be to provide community members with more information about neighbourhood officers._x000D_
_x000D_
More generally, these results suggest an interesting wrinkle in the psychology of anonymity and social interactions. There is an increasing number of ways for people to interact with others about whom they know very little. Milgram suggested that the ‚Äúultimate adaptation to an overloaded social environment is to ‚Ä¶ develop highly efficient perceptual means of determining whether an individual falls into the category of friend or stranger‚Äù12. It appears, however, that there is a profound imprecision in how we perceive these categories. We seem to assume that others see us as we see them._x000D_","Social ties often seem symmetric, but they need not be1,2,3,4,5. For example, a person might know a stranger better than the stranger knows them. We explored whether people overlook these asymmetries and what consequences that might have for people‚Äôs perceptions and actions. Here we show that when people know more about others, they think others know more about them. Across nine laboratory experiments, when participants learned more about a stranger, they felt as if the stranger also knew them better, and they acted as if the stranger was more attuned to their actions. As a result, participants were more honest around known strangers. We tested this further with a field experiment in New York City, in which we provided residents with mundane information about neighbourhood police officers. We found that the intervention shifted residents‚Äô perceptions of officers‚Äô knowledge of illegal activity, and it may even have reduced crime. It appears that our sense of anonymity depends not only on what people know about us but also on what we know about them.","5",0,"5","Political",4,0

Behavioral and Brain Sciences. 2014;37(3):297-307. doi:10.1017/S0140525X13001192","The extent to which politics evokes controversy is puzzling. Jost and Amodio ask the pertinent question: ‚ÄúHow is it that individuals and groups can be so strongly inspired by an abstract configuration of ideas that they are willing to sacrifice even their own lives?‚Äù (Reference Jost and Amodio2012). Along with religion (another abstract configuration of ideas capable of affecting the lives of others), politics is the topic most able to produce conflict at family reunions and on the battlefield. People do not typically come to blows over whether it is better to be an introvert or an extravert, presumably because introverts do not have to worry that they will need to change their behavior as a result of the existence of extraverts. Politics, however, is unavoidably intrusive. The mere presence of liberals [conservatives] creates a very real possibility that conservatives [liberals] in the same polity will not be able to structure society in the fashion they most desire. This potential imposition of values is likely one reason politics is so emotional and explosive (Brader Reference Brader2006; Marcus et al. Reference Marcus, Newman and Mackuen2000; Redlawsk Reference Redlawsk2006; Sullivan & Masters Reference Sullivan and Masters1988; Valentino et al. Reference Valentino, Hutchings, Banks and Davis2008).

The controversial nature of politics makes research on the differences between liberals and conservatives particularly sensitive. People are quick to be defensive and to suspect that their particular ideological beliefs are being defamed. As a result, it is appropriate to note in closing that citing differences in the psychological and physiological traits of liberals and conservatives is not equivalent to declaring one ideology superior to the other. Mounting empirical evidence suggests that, compared to liberals, conservatives are more responsive and attuned to negative stimuli, patterns consistent with their tendency to advocate political solutions designed to protect against threats and disorder ‚Äì real or perceived. Liberals appear not to notice, respond to, or attend to negative stimuli to the same degree, a pattern consistent with their willingness to advocate political solutions that could lead society to experience new approaches to life and governing but that could also leave society more vulnerable to threats and disorder. The relative advantages of one ideology compared to the other depend upon the circumstances. If a foreign policy threat turns out to be real, the conservative response will be extremely valuable; if it is not real, the liberal approach will be better positioned to cash in on opportunities the conservative response would miss.

Moreover, being more attuned to the dangers of the world does not make for pessimistic, fearful individuals and being less attuned to dangers does not make for carefree, hedonistic individuals. In fact, conservatives are consistently found to score higher than liberals on subjective well-being, even after controlling for socioeconomic status (Vigil Reference Vigil2010). Apparently, being responsive and attentive to negative aspects of the environment does not lead to depressive personalities. In fact, it may be that limiting the consequences of threats is a more manageable and defined goal than is pursuing novel experiences. Along these lines, it is well to remember that responding and attending to negative events is not the same thing as living in fear of them (see Aron Reference Aron1996). Turning to liberals, the desire for stimulation, self-expression and new experiences does not necessarily make for self-absorbed individuals. Liberals consistently score higher than conservatives on empathy scales (Hirsh et al. Reference Hirsh, DeYoung, Xu and Peterson2010). From an evolutionary perspective, insufficient attention and response to negative situations is clearly a problem but it is also the case that unrelenting vigilance and heightened physiological response also become problems at some point.

Finally, just as the tendency to read value judgments into the findings summarized here should be resisted, so should the tendency to conclude the results are stronger than they are. The connection of conservative political orientations and heightened orientation to negative stimuli is surprisingly consistent across designs, studies, and countries but it is also consistently modest in effect size. Many political conservatives are not particularly responsive to negative stimuli and many political liberals are. The reported effects, however, persist even when more traditional explanatory variables, such as standard sociodemographics, are included in the models. Moreover, to provide perspective, the effects of variation in negativity bias and related concepts, though modest, typically are at least as large as many of these standard variables.

A recurring feature of human history seems to be, as Atran puts it, people going ‚Äúto war without understanding the transcendent drives and dreams of adversaries who see a very different world‚Äù (Reference Atran2012). Empirical evidence is increasingly documenting the psychological and physiological differences across people that can lead them to perceive the world so differently. One person focuses on threats but when facing that same situation another person focuses on opportunities. It is not surprising that these different visions of reality lead to fundamentally different sets of political preferences. By documenting that political differences are not necessarily traceable to misinformation or ignorance on the part of one side or the other, scientific understanding of the broader and deeper bases of political diversity may make it possible for Emerson's forces of tradition and innovation to live together, if not more profitably, at least less violently.","Disputes between those holding differing political views are ubiquitous and deep-seated, and they often follow common, recognizable lines. The supporters of tradition and stability, sometimes referred to as conservatives, do battle with the supporters of innovation and reform, sometimes referred to as liberals. Understanding the correlates of those distinct political orientations is probably a prerequisite for managing political disputes, which are a source of social conflict that can lead to frustration and even bloodshed. A rapidly growing body of empirical evidence documents a multitude of ways in which liberals and conservatives differ from each other in purviews of life with little direct connection to politics, from tastes in art to desire for closure and from disgust sensitivity to the tendency to pursue new information, but the central theme of the differences is a matter of debate. In this article, we argue that one organizing element of the many differences between liberals and conservatives is the nature of their physiological and psychological responses to features of the environment that are negative. Compared with liberals, conservatives tend to register greater physiological responses to such stimuli and also to devote more psychological resources to them. Operating from this point of departure, we suggest approaches for refining understanding of the broad relationship between political views and response to the negative. We conclude with a discussion of normative implications, stressing that identifying differences across ideological groups is not tantamount to declaring one ideology superior to another.","7",0,"7","Political",4,1

Medical education, 43(8), 721-728.","To understand when and why less is more, it is important to understand the concept of robustness. In situations where decisions are liable to error‚Äîas they are in situations that involve uncertainty‚Äîrobustness plays the key role in the less-is-more effect.

The important distinction here is between data fitting and data prediction. Data fitting means fitting the parameters of a model to a body of data that is already known so that the model simply explains what has already happened. Here, using more information (free parameters) never hurts. By contrast, data prediction means testing whether a model can also predict comparable future events or outcomes. Here, however, using more information can hurt. If there are two diagnostic models, A and B, and A fits the known dataset better than B but predicts a comparable, yet new dataset less accurately than B, then model A is over-fitted to the known dataset.

Over-fitting occurs when a model, by using too much information (free parameters), fits ‚Äònoise‚Äô and idiosyncrasies of the present dataset that do not generalise to a new sample. Yet, especially for situations whose structure is not known in advance, a model‚Äôs most important feature is that it generalises well. A model‚Äôs ability to predict (generalise to) new data ‚Äì such as new patients ‚Äì is called ‚Äòrobustness‚Äô. Over-fitting, however, conflicts with the robustness of a model.

To make the two concepts more transparent, suppose for a moment that you need a new dress. One means of meeting this need is to visit a tailor, who will take all your body measurements, assign these to the fabric you choose and create a dress that will fit you perfectly. That is what happens when a model is fitted to known data. Now suppose that a dear friend with similar general body features such as weight and size desperately needs a dress for an important event and asks if she can borrow yours. You, of course, agree. Your friend arrives at your door, eagerly tries on the dress, but sees that it does not fit her properly because some aspects of it are overly fitted to your body alone. This situation is akin to what happens when a statistical model is overly fitted to a specific set of data and is subsequently less able to predict another comparable set of data. By contrast, if you had chosen simply to buy an off-the-rack dress according to your size and weight, your friend might have been luckier: because of its less specific parameters, the dress would have been more likely to fit your friend as well. This analogy describes why a model that uses less information is more likely to generalise to comparable yet new data.

Like several other decision-related tasks in medicine, predicting heart attacks is far from error-free and no one case is 100% identical to another. In the original sample of several thousand New England patients on which it was validated, the HDPI may well have provided a better fit than a fast and frugal tree. Yet, assuming that the predictive instrument is indeed an excellent tool for diagnosing patients in New England, it does not necessarily follow that it will perform equally well in Seattle, where new groups of patients will deviate in unknown ways from the original sample. In other words, the model that was best in the original population is not guaranteed to be best in these new populations. A fast and frugal heuristic that focuses only on the key variables is thus likely to be more robust and has a chance of performing better than the system that used more information. A world that is not perfectly predictable therefore requires that we ignore some information, as has been mathematically proven for specific situations.

However, less information is not always better. Too little information can also be detrimental and eventually leads to under-fitting. In order to avoid both over- and under-fitting, a variety of methods have been developed to help us decide which of several models (e.g. decision-making support tools) has the right degree of complexity. However, people seem to have a good sense of what information is important. Although no general rule determines in advance how much and which information should be ignored, as a rule of thumb one can say that the more uncertain and the more redundant the information, the more of it should be ignored.

The irony of the situation is that doctors often feel pressured to hide the ways by which they make decisions or to pretend the decisions were made on the basis of something more complicated. Part of this behaviour is rooted in the strong underlying belief that using heuristics will result in biases or in second-best solutions. The virtue of less-is-more is not yet fully understood and appreciated. As a consequence, the quality of treatment can suffer from covert and uneducated use of heuristics.

In recent years, medical researchers have begun to see the potential of fast and frugal decision making and to appreciate it as a powerful alternative to the prescriptions of classical decision theory in patient care. However, any change in methodology must be supported by legal reforms that free doctors from the fear of being punished for doing the best they can for their patients. Effective litigation law would start from the simple insight that less can be more and that no medical decision is absolutely certain.

Systematic training of doctors to use rules of thumb would allow them to make empirically sound, quick and transparent diagnostic decisions. McDonald emphasised this issue over a decade ago: ‚ÄòThe heuristics of medicine should be discussed, criticised, refined, and then taught. More uniform use of explicit and better heuristics could lead to less practice variation and more efficient medical care.‚Äô

Although we cannot present a complete curriculum describing how exactly the science of heuristics should be taught in medical education, what we can do is indicate some important milestones that should be met. Today‚Äôs medical students should learn and understand that heuristics are neither good nor bad per se, but that their reliability and usefulness interplays with environmental circumstances, such as the inherent uncertainty of a specific situation. To broaden students‚Äô knowledge of what kind of environmental circumstances can be exploited in what fashion by what heuristic mechanisms seems as crucial as to teach them the building blocks from which heuristics can be constructed and adjusted for other problems or populations.

After the basics have been delivered, a clinical teacher might continue, for instance, by introducing students to the various methods of constructing fast and frugal trees. In medicine, such trees are usually intended to first reduce misses and then decrease false alarms. This asymmetry will be reflected in the construction rules, which are aimed at achieving a large number of correct hits (e.g. correct assignments to coronary care units) at the first decisional level. For instance, one possible rule is to rank available information (e.g. chest pain) by sensitivity and to start the tree with the most sensitive piece of information.

Practical units, where medical students can try out the success of different rules for self-chosen medical questions, will help to deepen students‚Äô understanding of heuristic tools and might even inspire novel research in the field of medical decision-making support tools. As Green reported (personal conversation), doctors at the Michigan Hospital still enjoy using the fast and frugal tree, more than a decade after its use was initiated.

Truly efficient health care requires that we master the complementary arts of focusing on what is important and discarding what can simply be ignored.","Context How do doctors make sound decisions when confronted with probabilistic data, time pressures and a heavy workload? One theory that has been embraced by many researchers is based on optimisation, which emphasises the need to integrate all information in order to arrive at sound decisions. This notion makes heuristics, which use less than complete information, appear as second-best strategies. In this article, we challenge this pessimistic view of heuristics.

Methods We introduce two medical problems that involve decision making to the reader: one concerns coronary care issues and the other macrolide prescriptions. In both settings, decision-making tools grounded in the principles of optimisation and heuristics, respectively, have been developed to assist doctors in making decisions. We explain the structure of each of these tools and compare their performance in terms of their facilitation of correct predictions.

Results For decisions concerning both the coronary care unit and the prescribing of macrolides, we demonstrate that sacrificing information does not necessarily imply a forfeiting of predictive accuracy, but can sometimes even lead to better decisions. Subsequently, we discuss common misconceptions about heuristics and explain when and why ignoring parts of the available information can lead to the making of more robust predictions.

Conclusions Heuristics are neither good nor bad per se, but, if applied in situations to which they have been adapted, can be helpful companions for doctors and doctors-in-training. This, however, requires that heuristics in medicine be openly discussed, criticised, refined and then taught to doctors-in-training rather than being simply dismissed as harmful or irrelevant. A more uniform use of explicit and accepted heuristics has the potential to reduce variations in diagnoses and to improve medical care for patients.","4",1,"Apolitical","Political",4,1
45,8,"Frohlich, N., & Oppenheimer, J. A. (1990). Choosing justice in experimental democracies with production. American Political Science Review, 84(2), 461-477.","The results of these experiments offer tentative answers to the questions posed at the outset. Acceptance of the taxation principle is not adversely affected by the economic experience of subjects after the veil is lifted. There is no evidence for an undermining of the principle as subjects experience its effects. Guaranteeing a subsistence income to those who cannot earn that level of reward does not undermine the legitimacy of the system in the short run as measured by rankings of principles, security regarding one's rankings, or satisfaction. However, when subjects participate in choosing the principle, their satisfaction is higher than when it is imposed upon them. When they participate and are required to choose unanimously, their confidence in the choice increases. This is not the case when they choose via majority rule. _x000D_
_x000D_
The floor constraint principle appears to be a robust choice when experienced in practice in a production environment. Its first-place ranking is unchallenged at the end. In summary, acceptance of the principle is, if anything, enhanced by the production and redistribution experience. But these effects appear to be stronger in the choice experiments. Participation in discussion and choice makes a difference in subsequent attitudes and changes in attitudes. _x000D_
_x000D_
This short-run acceptability of the principle across all groups must be tempered by an underlying trend in productivity. Productivity shows a tendency to increase in taxpayers in all treatments and shows a substantial increase among recipients in the choice experiments. By contrast, recipients in the imposed experiments seem to decrease their productivity. At least for recipients of transfers, participation in a group discussion behind a veil of ignorance, participation in choosing a redistributive principle, and experience with the economic consequences of the principle seem to make a difference. Transfer recipients' productivity goes up significantly over time. Rather than acting as a disincentive, the taxation and redistribution system that guarantees a floor when agreed to in a participative fashion seems to spur those at the bottom of the income distribution to increase their effort and output. Participatory democracy (at least in an experimental setting) aids productivity. _x000D_
_x000D_
The discussions behind the simulated veil parallel and throw into clear relief the widespread political debates in Western democracies regarding the appropriate limits for the welfare state as opposed to a laissez faire economy. The results reaffirm that subjects can reach consensus on a principle behind a simulated veil of ignorance. Concern for the poor and weak, a desire to recognize entitlements, and sensitivity to the need for incentives to maintain productivity all enter into subjects' deliberations regarding a fair rule for implementing distributive justice. The choice of, and continued support for, the floor constraint principle demonstrates how it serves as a compromise incorporating these competing normative and empirical demands. _x000D_
_x000D_
Moreover, the effect of the experimental treatment on productivity offers an insight into how a redistributive regime can be rendered stable. There are two themes that pervade the arguments of both politicians and citizens who attack income support programs: (1) An income support program will sap incentives among recipients and will make them dependent and unproductive; (2) It will create a moral hazard and attract the ""undeserving""‚Äî the ""welfare cheaters""‚Äîwhich is unfair to all those who work and ultimately pay for the programs. At least within small groups, explicit discussion of what constitutes fairness establishes the need for, and legitimacy of, some sort of support program. When those who ultimately are to be recipients of transfers participate actively in the decision, the dreaded result of increasing dependence and sloth do not materialize. Quite the contrary. It appears that recipients who actively participate in the decision recognize the entitlement claims of those who are paying for transfer payments and almost literally redouble their efforts to pull their own weight. By contrast, when recipients function under a (functionally identical) income support system that has been imposed upon them and in which they have had no substantial say, they appear to free ride. Their efforts appear to flag and their productivity shows a declining trend. They appear to view the transfers they receive as their due, and they do not make efforts to become self-sustaining. Genuine participation and debate in determining the content of programs appears necessary to prevent the undermining of income support programs. _x000D_
_x000D_
Of course, there are enormous barriers to the implementation, writ large, of the kind of process that we have set up in the laboratory. But the data point to a need for more informed debate and discussion. For without that participation, the fears of income support critics might be well founded. This need for broader participation is all the more important, given the well-known propensity in democratic systems to decreased political activity with decreased sodoeconomic status. _x000D_
_x000D_
Apart from the experimental results, the possible efficacy of involving workers in decisions is demonstrated by the evidence emerging from the industrial relations literature. Profit-sharing schemes, participation in workplace quality of life issues, the use of quality circles, and a general openness of management to the suggestions from the shop floor are all beginning to show promise of increasing worker productivity. The necessity of participation in such schemes is reflected in Kanter 1987 (p. 32): ""For gainsharing plans to work, a particular organizational structure and corporate culture are required‚Äîand these include an open discussion of the plan to gain employee acceptance, the establishment of cross-unit teams or task forces to develop the plan, and the adoption of suggestion systems."" _x000D_
_x000D_
A moment's reflection on the underlying dynamics of the production environment in the experiments and, indeed, on the production teams operating in industry reveals that they represent ""social dilemmas."" There are incentives for the least productive to free ride and accept their guaranteed payoffs or their share of the productivity gains of others' efforts. The extensive literature on cooperation in social dilemmas reveals that discussion (especially relevant discussion) increases cooperation in social dilemmas (Dawes 1980; Dawes, McTavish, and Shaklee 1977; Messick and Brewer 1983). From that perspective it should not be surprising that increased participation in determining the content of the reward structure should increase the efforts of those who otherwise would have an incentive to free ride. Indeed, any income redistribution system can be seen to incorporate elements of social dilemmas; so potential solutions that are effective in overcoming free rider tendencies there are of interest in insulating redistributive systems from deleterious effects. _x000D_
_x000D_
One should not go too far in interpreting these results. The laboratory setting requires a compression of time, income, and stakes and involves small groups. And their subjects, after all, are university students. Nevertheless, the results provide an argument for meaningful participation in the democratic process which goes beyond the simple requirements of informed decision making and fairness. Meaningful participation on a broader scale might well have beneficial implications for the productivity of the economy. It is not all dear how such participation might be accomplished, but its potential impact appears to be worth examining._x000D_","We examine in a laboratory setting how direct participation in choosing a principle of distributive justice and a tax system impinges on subjects' attitudes and subsequent productivity when they participate in a task, produce income, and then experience losses or gains according to the tax system. Experience with a redistributive principle and its associated taxation system in a production environment does not detract from overall acceptance of the distributive principle, particularly for subjects who participate in choosing the principle. Participation in discussion, choice, and production increases subjects' convictions regarding their preferences. For these subjects (especially recipients of transfers) productivity rises significantly over the course of the experiments. No such effect is evident for subjects who do not participate in setting the regime under which they are to labor. The results' implications for questions of democratic participation and the stability of income support programs are drawn.","3",0,"3","Political",2,0

We posit that our method can capture bias reliably, as dose-response, placebo, and robustness tests suggest. Therefore, our results raise concerns that ChatGPT, and LLMs in general, can extend and amplify existing political bias challenges stemming from either traditional media (Levendusky, 2013; Bernhardt et al., 2008) or the Internet and social media (Zhuravskaya et al., 2020) regarding political processes. Our findings have important implications for policymakers and stakeholders in media, politics, and academia._x000D_
_x000D_
The results we document here potentially originate from two distinct sources, although we cannot tell the exact source of the bias. We have tried to force ChatGPT into some sort of developer mode to try to access any knowledge about biased data or directives that could be biasing answers. It was categorical in affirming that every reasonable step was taken in data curation, and that it and OpenAI are unbiased.Footnote15_x000D_
_x000D_
The first potential source of bias is the training data. To train GPT-3, OpenAI declares it cleans the CommonCrawl dataset and adds information to it (Brown et al., 2020). Although the cleaning procedure is reasonably clear and apparently neutral, the selection of the added information is not. Therefore, there are two non-exclusive possibilities: (1) the original training dataset has biases and the cleaning procedure does not remove them, and (2) GPT-3 creators incorporate their own biases via the added information (Navigli et al., 2023; Caliskan et al., 2017; Solaiman et al., 2019)._x000D_
_x000D_
The second potential source is the algorithm itself. It is a known issue that machine learning algorithms can amplify existing biases in training data (Hovy & Prabhumoye, 2021), failing to replicate known distributions of characteristics of the population (Prates et al., 2020). Some posit that these algorithmic biases, just like data curation biases, can arise due to personal biases from their creators (AI Now Institute, 2019). The most likely scenario is that both sources of bias influence ChatGPT‚Äôs output to some degree, and disentangling these two components (training data versus algorithm), although not trivial, surely is a relevant topic for future research._x000D_

6 Conclusion_x000D_
ChatGPT has experienced exponential adoption, reaching one million users within one week of its launch and more than 100 million about a month later (Ruby, 2023). Such widespread adoption, paired with concerns about potential risks from AI-powered systems (Acemoglu, 2021; United States Congress, 2022; Future of Life Institute, 2015), highlight the importance of reliably and quickly identifying potential issues._x000D_
_x000D_
We answer a call from van Dis et al. (2023) to hold LLMs on to human verification, addressing the standing issue of the lack of a reliable method for measuring their biases. We focus on the issue of political bias, as it can have major social consequences (Bernhardt et al., 2008; Chiang & Knight, 2011; Groseclose & Milyo, 2005; Levendusky, 2013) and is subtler than other biases (Peters, 2022). We acknowledge the fundamental randomness of LLMs and create a simple method to measure political bias._x000D_
_x000D_
We leverage the increased capacity of LLMs to engage in human-like interactions by using questionnaires that are already available for humans, mitigating concerns over templates, attribute and target seeds, and choice of word embeddings that can lead to contradicting results (Aky√ºrek et al., 2022). The simplicity of our method democratizes the oversight of these systems. It speeds up and decentralizes their supervision, in a scenario in which developers may be willing to sacrifice safeguarding processes to quickly monetize their products (Meyer, 2023). It is particularly important that our method does not need access to the inner parameters of the LLM, like word embeddings (Caliskan et al., 2017), as companies make them opaque or costly due to competition concerns (Vincent, 2023; Science Media Centre, 2023), nor advanced programming skills._x000D_
_x000D_
We believe our method can support the crucial duty of ensuring such systems are impartial and unbiased, mitigating potential negative political and electoral effects, and safeguarding general public trust in this technology. Finally, we also contribute to the more general issue of how to measure bias in LLMs, as our method can be deployed to any domain where a questionnaire to measure people‚Äôs ideology exists._x000D_","We investigate the political bias of a large language model (LLM), ChatGPT, which has become popular for retrieving factual information and generating content. Although ChatGPT assures that it is impartial, the literature suggests that LLMs exhibit bias involving race, gender, religion, and political orientation. Political bias in LLMs can have adverse political and electoral consequences similar to bias from traditional and social media. Moreover, political bias can be harder to detect and eradicate than gender or racial bias. We propose a novel empirical design to infer whether ChatGPT has political biases by requesting it to impersonate someone from a given side of the political spectrum and comparing these answers with its default. We also propose dose-response, placebo, and profession-politics alignment robustness tests. To reduce concerns about the randomness of the generated text, we collect answers to the same questions 100 times, with question order randomized on each round. We find robust evidence that ChatGPT presents a significant and systematic political bias toward the Democrats in the US, Lula in Brazil, and the Labour Party in the UK. These results translate into real concerns that ChatGPT, and LLMs in general, can extend or even amplify the existing challenges involving political processes posed by the Internet and social media.

We are, however, confident that the scenarios used here were representative of contrarian claims: Study 1 showed that the claims used in our study constituted a notable share of contrarian Internet discourse. This conclusion was further buttressed by the rating study reported in the Online Supplementary Material, which affirmed that climate experts were consistently able to identify the techniques used by contrarians in our scenarios, and additionally judged those techniques to be common and representative._x000D_
_x000D_
The second criticism might invoke the possibility that the experts‚Äô judgments were colored by their tacit expectations about trends in the data‚Äîfor example, economists may have some expectation about how lithium production is likely to have unfolded. We ensured that those expectations would not uniformly favor the contrarian or mainstream interpretation of the data in several ways: for example, we used the profits of a fictitious company (the ‚ÄúSupreme Widget Corporation‚Äù) for one of our scenarios, and to the extent that one can form expectations about a fictitious company, they are likely to point to an increase in profits rather than a decline. Because the data actually plotted the decline in Arctic ice, any expectations about increasing profits would thus favor the contrarian interpretation which denied the decline. Similarly, the trends in rural village population are going to be different depending on country or region, so even if our experts had some prior beliefs about rural populations, different participants would have had different countries or regions in mind. In consequence, it is difficult to see how expectations could have consistently favored one interpretation over another for this scenario._x000D_
_x000D_
A third criticism might hold that Study 2 did not examine opposing claims by actors who accept the findings from climate science but might distort their interpretations for ‚Äúalarmist‚Äù or ‚Äúactivist‚Äù political purposes. The existence of misleading or exaggerated claims by people who otherwise endorse the IPCC consensus position cannot be ruled out. However, it is clear that exaggerated ‚Äúalarmist‚Äù claims play little role in public discourse (at least in the U.S. and U.K.; Painter and Ashe, 2012). The fault line of political debate lies between mainstream climate science, as embodied by the IPCC, on the one hand, and contrarian claims that downplay the existence or extent of climate change on the other (e.g., Boykoff and Boykoff, 2004, Boykoff, 2013, Freudenburg and Muselli, 2013). Our study therefore addressed the question of greatest public interest; namely, whether contrarian argumentation withstands scrutiny in a blind test. We found that it fails to do so._x000D_
_x000D_
3.2. Implications_x000D_
The results extend earlier findings that uncovered flaws in the few contrarian academic publications (Abraham et al., 2014, Benestad et al., 2015). Intriguingly, the climate experts in the Rating study identified some contrarian techniques as being highly prevalent that Benestad et al. (2015) also identified as attributes of flawed contrarian publications. Whereas previous authors relied on judgment and statistical re-analyses to identify flaws, the present results arose in a blind test of experts from two different disciplines. This rules out the possibility that participants may have been driven by any extraneous considerations in their adjudication._x000D_
_x000D_
Our blind test constitutes a particularly conservative test of the claims. By translating the data into economic terms, a broader range of interpretations becomes permissible than in the initial climate context which is constrained by the underlying physics. The role of physics and relevant expert knowledge became most apparent in the AI2 scenario, which pertained to the decline of arctic sea ice extent. The contrarian claim highlighted a short-term rebound from a record minimum (in 2012), whereas the mainstream statement emphasized the underlying downward trend over the past decades (e.g., Kinnard et al., 2011). The experts in Study 2 were more tolerant of the contrarian claim when presented within a trade surplus scenario. This likely reflected the fact that a trade surplus, unlike the decline in arctic ice, is not driven by inexorable physical processes that unfold over longer time scales. A focus on annual variations is thus judged to be less misleading for economic indicators._x000D_
_x000D_
We conclude that public statements by contrarians fail to meet expert approval. Their uncritical inclusion in media discourse therefore does the public a disservice and confirms that media ‚Äúbalance‚Äù can be a form of bias (Boykoff and Boykoff, 2004) or even self-censorship if contrarian views override scientific opinions (Antilla, 2010)._x000D_
_x000D_
The insertion of misleading contrarian statements into public discourse has demonstrable adverse consequences. For example, when people watch climate ‚Äúskeptic‚Äù movies, the experience notably decreases environmental concern compared to a neutral movie (Greitemeyer, 2013). Similar adverse effects on attitudes have been observed after the presentation of ‚Äúcherry-picked‚Äù misleading numbers akin to some of the claims examined here (Ranney and Clark, 2016), and after presentation of contrarian frames (McCright et al., 2016). The insertion of dissenting opinions can reduce the perception of expert consensus, and support for corrective policies, even when participants are given numeric information about a strong expert consensus (Koehler, 2016)._x000D_
_x000D_
More worryingly still, contrarian claims may have altered the course of science itself (Brysse et al., 2013, Lewandowsky et al., 2015a, Lewandowsky et al., 2015b). In at least one instance, an interpretation of global temperature data that originated in contrarian circles but then found entry into mainstream climate science‚Äîviz. the alleged recent ‚Äúpause‚Äù or ‚Äúhiatus‚Äù in global warming (Boykoff, 2014)‚Äîhas been found to be wanting in a blind test similar to the one reported here (Lewandowsky et al., 2015b)._x000D_
_x000D_
The present results may therefore be valuable for communicators who seek to guard against the influence of misleading information by ‚Äúinoculation‚Äù; that is, by explaining why particular messages are misleading (Banas and Rains, 2010)._x000D_","Although virtually all experts agree that CO2 emissions are causing anthropogenic global warming, public discourse is replete with contrarian claims that either deny that global warming is happening or dispute a human influence. Although the rejection of climate science is known to be driven by ideological, psychological, and political factors rather than scientific disagreement, contrarian views have considerable prominence in the media. A better understanding of contrarian discourse is therefore called for. We report a blind expert test of contrarian claims about climatological variables. Expert economists and statisticians were presented with representative contrarian statements (e.g., ‚ÄúArctic ice is recovering‚Äù) translated into an economic or demographic context. In that blind test, contrarian claims were found to be misleading. By contrast, mainstream scientific interpretations of the data were judged to be accurate and policy relevant. The results imply that media inclusion of contrarian statements may increase bias rather than balance.","4",0,"4","Political",2,1

Current Anthropology, 47(6), 1027-1034.","Our models suggest that cultural evolution should produce individuals who are reluctant to copy others and yet promote being copied by others. Empirical data provide some support: people tend to stick to their ideas, including, for example, religious faith (Sandomirsky and Wilson 1990; Lawton and Bures 2000; Loveland 2003) and political views (Kent Jennings and van Deth 1990; Richardson 1991), and it is common to advertise or argue for ones views. These traits have interesting parallels in genetic evolution. Conservatism promotes the integrity of cultural types and may be compared to mechanisms of genomic integrity (Maynard Smith and Szathmry 1995). Persuasion promotes the spreading of cultural types, which follows the general tendency of evolutionary processes to favor efficient reproduction (Dawkins 1976; Fisher 1958)._x000D_
_x000D_
It should be possible to test whether individual personalities change in the direction predicted by our models. Personality is often studied in the socalled Big Five framework, which considers five broad dimensions along which individual personalities vary (John and Srivastava 1999). Recent studies observe some significant correlations between personality measures and age, but it is difficult to relate these results to our models. For instance, while one of the Big Five dimensions is referred to as openness, it is not defined exactly as in our models (e.g., it includes intelligence as well as curiosity). It is nevertheless interesting to note that a decrease in openness (sensu Big Five) with age is one of the most robust findings in studies of longterm personality change (McCrae et al. 1999; LabouvieVief et al. 2000; Srivastava et al. 2003). Traits that are potentially involved in persuading others appear in most, if not all, Big Five dimensions, and no clear conclusion seems possible from the published data. These studies suggest, however, that our models could be tested by developing specific questionnaires and experiments._x000D_
_x000D_
Whereas in our models populations reach almost complete conservatism, this is not true of actual populations. The reasons should be sought in forces that we have ignored but that can influence the cultural evolutionary process. For instance, many personality traits are under both environmental and genetic control (Plomin et al. 2000; Laland and Brown 2002; see also guided variation in Boyd and Richerson 1985), and it is possible that our genetic constitution does not allow complete conservatism. In such a case a simple tabula rasa hypothesis will be inadequate to describe the dynamics of openness. Natural selection and socioeconomic processes are examples of other potent forces that can shape culture (Richerson and Boyd 2005; Laland, Kumm, and Feldman 1995; Feldman and Laland 1996; Bisin and Verdier 2001). We have chosen not to examine them have because we wanted to start from a simple case in which the effects of evolvable cultural transmission were not confounded with other forces. Such effects are poorly known, and it seemed to us premature to study a complex model before having understood simpler ones. Most mathematical models of cultural evolution assume that the way we learn from others is under genetic control (Boyd and Richerson 1985; Henrich and Boyd 1998) and do not allow for cultural modification of transmission rules (but see Takahasi 1998). Richerson and Boyd, for instance, argue that natural selection has injected into our psychology a degree of conformism which improves our ability to choose adaptive cultural traits (Boyd and Richerson 1985; Richerson and Boyd 2005). Our arguments show that biases in cultural transmission may result purely from cultural dynamics. Thus even if genes are not structuring culture, culture structures itself. Freedom from genetic influence is not freedom to take any direction._x000D_","In the human sciences, cultural evolution is often viewed as an autonomous process essentially free of genetic influence. A question that follows is, If culture is not influenced by genes, can it take any path? Employing a simple mathematical model of cultural transmission in which individuals may copy each others traits, it can be shown that cultural evolution favors individuals who are weakly influenced by others and able to influence others. The model suggests that the cultural evolution of rules of cultural transmission tends to create populations that evolve rapidly toward conservatism. Bias in cultural transmission may result purely from cultural dynamics. Freedom from genetic influence is not freedom to take any direction.","5",0,"5","Political",4,0

Social Psychological and Personality Science, 8(6), 612-622.","People on both political extremes categorize stimuli in the political domain more strongly than do moderates. They are more likely to cluster similar political stimuli closer together and form tighter, more homogeneous categories. This applies to a wide range of political stimuli, such as politicians (Study 1), groups associated with different ideologies (Study 2), or newspapers (Study 3), and also applies to the inferences that people make about politics‚Äîfor example, how people vote across the country (Study 4) and whether politically different people share personal tastes (Study 5) or social relationships (Study 6‚Äì8)._x000D_
_x000D_
The current work extends beyond existing work by its basic nature. Earlier research shows that people on the political extremes exaggerate differences across the political divide, see greater polarization in their opponents‚Äô attitudes, and are more dogmatic (Conway et al., 2016; Graham, Nosek, & Haidt, 2012; Van Boven et al., 2012; Westfall et al., 2015). The current findings fit with that literature but go beyond it by showing that people with strong political opinions not only have more extreme views but even represent the political domain differently. They categorize the same stimuli differently and perceive more homogeneous and separate categories than do moderates and neutrals._x000D_
_x000D_
As such, the current findings provide an unmotivated and purely perceptual explanation of many effects observed in political psychology. For example, the finding that those on the extremes have a more extreme opinion (Westfall et al., 2015) can be explained with the notion that strong categorization leads to larger perceived between-category differences (Krueger & Rothbart, 1990; Nosofsky, 1987). People with a strong political preference tend to engage in more biased information processing (Bartels, 2002; Taber, Cann, & Kucsova, 2009; Taber & Lodge, 2006; Westen, Blagov, Harenski, Kilts, & Hamann, 2006). This can be explained with the notion that categorization helps to process information more selectively (Bruner & Postman, 1949; Hamilton & Gifford, 1976). As a third example, people with a strong political preference see their opponents as more ideology driven (Chambers, Baron, & Inman, 2006; Chambers & Melnyk, 2006; Robinson, Keltner, Ward, & Ross, 1995). This fits with our findings because people who categorize strongly assimilate more strongly across same-category stimuli (Ames, 2004; Tenenbaum & Griffiths, 2001)._x000D_
_x000D_
Political Sophistication and Other Limitations_x000D_
Across these studies, we used various approaches to rule out the alternative explanation that these effects are driven by greater political knowledge and sophistication among those at the political extremes. First, we used stimuli that do not require sophistication but are instead easy to sort according to political ideology. For example, in Study 1, we used pilot testing to confirm that all participants were able to categorize the used stimuli correctly. Second, in Study 3, we measured categorization according to participants‚Äô ideographic beliefs about stimuli‚Äôs political nature, rather than their objective ideological nature, thus bypassing any effect of sophistication. Third, in Study 4, we compared categorization strength and accuracy and found that stronger categorization shown by participants on the political extremes resulted in less accurate perception, compared to moderates, thus arguing against an explanation based on them being more knowledgeable. Fourth, in Study 7, we found that experimentally increasing the salience of political ideology boosted the effect, which argues against the alternative explanation, because sophistication should not be affected by salience. Fifth, in Study 8, we directly measured differences in political knowledge and found that the quadratic effect remained significant after controlling for them. In summary, although results of individual studies may be vulnerable to an explanation based on political sophistication, together these studies solve that problem._x000D_
_x000D_
The methodological diversity of these studies also solves other possible concerns and confounds. For example, although the results of Study 6 may be explained by the notion that people with a strong political identity live in objectively more homogeneous social environments (Motyl, 2014; Schulz-Herzenberg, 2013), this cannot explain the results of the other studies._x000D_
_x000D_
One limitation to the current results was the exclusive reliance on MTurk samples. Although such samples target people from all walks of life and are therefore less unrepresentative than typical college student samples (Berinsky, Huber, & Lenz, 2012; Buhrmester, Kwang, & Gosling, 2011; Mason & Suri, 2011), replication of these results in a representative sample would be welcome. We did solve one of the most important concerns with MTurk samples, reduced naivety (Chandler, Pe‚Äôer, Paolacci, Mueller, & Ratliff, 2015), by disallowing participation in more than one study._x000D_
_x000D_
Implications_x000D_
When differences between political groups or stimuli are large and real, drawing sharper political clusters and categories can increase the efficient use of cognitive resources, allowing people on the political extremes to draw inferences more quickly than the politically moderate (Allport, 1954; Bruner, 1957). On the other hand, it may lead people to exaggerate differences between categories and thus introduce oversimplified and erroneous thinking about a complex and multifaceted world (Allport, 1954; Fiske & Neuberg, 1990; Park & Judd, 2005). This explains why liberals and conservatives in the United States find it so difficult to connect. People on the political extremes may not only miss opportunities to connect across the partisan divide because of negative emotions or lack of motivation but also because in their perception of political reality there simply is no middle ground. In a reality that is characterized by growing polarization and a need for political nuance, awareness of such effects is of crucial importance (Haidt, 2012). If people with different political opinions are to live together in the same society, then they need to be able to perceive and understand the finer distinctions of their own and opposing political ideologies. If instead people see reality in black and white terms, then this can only lead to unproductive and uncivil disagreement._x000D_","How does political preference affect categorization in the political domain? Eight studies demonstrate that people on both ends of the political spectrum‚Äîstrong Republicans and strong Democrats‚Äîform simpler and more clustered categories of political stimuli than do moderates and neutrals. This pattern was obtained regardless of whether stimuli were politicians (Study 1), social groups (Study 2), or newspapers (Study 3). Furthermore, both strong Republicans and strong Democrats were more likely to make inferences about the world based on their clustered categorization. This was found for estimating the likelihood that geographical location determines voting (Study 4), that political preference determines personal taste (Study 5), and that social relationships determine political preference (Study 6). The effect is amplified if political ideology is salient (Study 7) and remains after controlling for differences in political sophistication (Study 8). The political domain appears simpler to the politically extreme than to political moderates.","4",0,"4","Political",4,0

The motivated mind, 129-204.","We have argued that several specific motives relating to the management of fear and uncertainty are associated with the ideology of political conservatism. Our analysis in terms of motivated social cognition helps both to integrate seemingly unrelated hypotheses derived from the literature on personality and individual differences and social psychology and to expand on these hypotheses to further understand the role of situational factors in the vicissitudes of conservatism. By reviewing the results from many different studies aggregated across various behavioral domains and contexts, we found that a moderate to strong relationship does exist between an interrelated set of epistemic, existential, and ideological motives and the expression of political conservatism. In concluding, we consider issues that are deserving of future empirical attention and summarize what we have learned by viewing political conservatism through a motivated social‚Äìcognitive lens. _x000D_
_x000D_
A Plea for Future Research _x000D_
One of the most promising implications of treating political conservatism as a specific manifestation of motivated social cognition is a theoretical and practical focus on situational determinants. This is because explanations in social cognition tend to emphasize the temporary accessibility of certain attitudes, beliefs, goals, and motives and their perceived applicability to the immediate situation (e.g., Bargh & Gollwitzer, 1994; Higgins, 1996; Kruglanski, 1989). We have reviewed existing evidence concerning the effects of situationally induced threats on conservative political outcomes, but much more of interest remains to be done. Our hope is that, by underscoring the cognitive‚Äìmotivational bases of political conservatism, future research will at long last address a wider range of social situations and conditions that give rise and momentum to conservative attitudes, thoughts, behaviors, and even social movements. _x000D_
Although the evidence concerning the effects of threat on conservative ideology is highly instructive, other situational predictors of conservative attitudes and responses are still relatively understudied in the psychology of conservatism. Because conservatism often takes the form of a social movement that is shared by large groups of people in particular historical periods (e.g., Diamond, 1995; Habermas, 1989; Kolko, 1963; Lyons & Berlet, 1996), it may be thought of as a social norm that emerges under certain social and political circumstances. Our review indicates that too many psychological accounts of conservatism in the past have treated it solely as a dispositional orientation and not as a situational reaction, although it is true that the disposition is often hypothesized to develop in response to certain social and family situations in childhood (e.g., Adorno et al., 1950; Altemeyer, 1981, 1988; Sears, 1983; Sulloway, 1996; Tomkins, 1995). For the sake of understanding the nature of ideology, we hope future studies are as successful at documenting the temporary accessibility of rightwing attitudes as studies of individual differences have been at documenting the chronic accessibility of such orientations and their correlates. _x000D_
_x000D_
Consistent with these goals, we note that there is a strong need to go beyond purely correlational research designs, which limited the validity of the earlier personality research on authoritarianism, dogmatism, and the origins of political ideology and contributed to its eventual obscurity (see W. F. Stone et al., 1993). Thus far, the strongest experimental evidence bearing on the possibility of manipulating conservative tendencies probably comes from the mortality salience paradigm used by terror management theorists. Priming thoughts of death has been shown to increase intolerance, out-group derogation, punitive aggression, veneration of authority figures, and system justification (Florian et al., 2001; Greenberg et al., 1990, 1995; McGregor et al., 2001; Rosenblatt et al., 1989; Schimel et al., 1999; van den Bos & Miedema, 2000). Other archival and experimental evidence suggests that social and economic threats increase authoritarian and right-wing responding (e.g., Doty et al., 1991; Jost, 1996; McCann, 1997; Reich, 1946/ 1970; Sales, 1972, 1973; Sales & Friend, 1973). Experimental paradigms developed in studies of the need for cognitive closure, prevention versus promotion regulatory focus, and system justification are also highly promising candidates for use in future research on situational variation in conservatism. The next generation of researchers should also strive, whenever possible, to include more direct measures of epistemic, existential, and ideological motives. _x000D_
_x000D_
All of the motives we have reviewed are theoretically related to one or both of two core dimensions of conservative thought, namely, resistance to change and support for inequality. The quest for certainty and ideological stability, we have argued, is linked to the goal of resisting social and political change (e.g., Wilson, 1973c). Motives pertaining to fear and threat, by comparison, are more likely to be associated with ideological support for inequality, insofar as it justifies the striving for security and dominance in social hierarchies (e.g., Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). These are theoretical points that await direct empirical confrontation, especially as regards the direction of causality. Do psychological motives cause the adoption of specific ideological beliefs concerning resistance to change and support for inequality, or do these ideological commitments carry with them psychological consequences, or both? Our review has presented consistent correlational evidence linking the psychological and the political, and our integrated theoretical framework has identified plausible interpretations of these data, but direct causal investigations are needed in the future to substantiate the particulars of our theoretical perspective. _x000D_
_x000D_
Finally, it is also important that subsequent research reflect a wide range of political ideologies and broadly representative samples so that it does not merely address the ideological life of college students (see Sears, 1986; Whitley & Lee, 2000). On one hand, political ideology probably has greater consistency and meaning for college-educated respondents; on the other, the ideological contents of political conservatism (and its opposites) may be different in a predominantly liberal environment such as a college campus compared with other contexts. Such locations may prove useful in future studies of social and cognitive motives associated with political liberalism, which we would also encourage. Although we have made a special effort to include nonstudent samples in our review, two thirds of the studies we reviewed were conducted with university students. The use of nonrepresentative samples stymied research progress on the authoritarian personality for many years (e.g., Hyman & Sheatsley, 1954) until it was revived by Altemeyer (1981, 1988, 1996, 1998). It is essential that contemporary researchers of political conservatism not make the same mistake. _x000D_
_x000D_
The trend to investigate ideological opinions and right-wing tendencies in a wide variety of national contexts is one that we hope continues (e.g., Fay & Frese, 2000; Fibert & Ressler, 1998; Golec, 2001; Hamilton, Sanders, & McKearney, 1995; Jost et al., 2001; Kemmelmeier, 1997; Mercer & Cairns, 1981; Sidanius, 1984, 1985; Sidanius & Ekehammar, 1979). We reviewed research conducted in 12 different countries: the United States, Canada, England, Scotland, Sweden, Italy, Germany, Poland, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Thus, the conclusions we have reached possess a considerable degree of cultural generalizability. Nevertheless, future research‚Äîespecially if conducted in traditionally socialist or communist societies in which adherence to the status quo is unconfounded with right-wing ideological orientation‚Äîwould add significantly to knowledge about political conservatism as motivated social cognition. Our conviction is that important and groundbreaking advances await any researcher who is willing and able to conduct causal, experimental studies on the personal and situational determinants of conservative ideological responses in research samples that are representative and culturally diverse. We hope the present article serves as a stimulus for renewed, methodologically sophisticated attention to the psychological bases of political conservatism. _x000D_
_x000D_
What Have We Learned? _x000D_
Understanding the psychological underpinnings of conservatism has for centuries posed a challenge for historians, philosophers, and social scientists. By now, hundreds of empirical investigations have been carried out worldwide, and at least three types of theories have been offered to explicate the psychological bases of conservative and right-wing ideologies. Our contribution here has been to review and summarize this work and to integrate it within the ambitious and broad framework of motivated social cognition (see Figure 1). In doing so, we have drawn a number of conclusions, which should be made explicit in order to better understand the various ways in which political conservatism may be thought of as a form of motivated social cognition. _x000D_
_x000D_
An important conclusion that follows from our analysis is that political attitudes and beliefs possess a strong motivational basis (e.g., Duckitt, 2001; Dunning, 1999; Fiske & Taylor, 1991; Kruglanski, 1996; Kunda, 1990). Conservative ideologies, like virtually all other belief systems, are adopted in part because they satisfy various psychological needs. To say that ideological belief systems have a strong motivational basis is not to say that they are unprincipled, unwarranted, or unresponsive to reason or evidence. Although the (partial) causes of ideological beliefs may be motivational, the reasons (and rationalizations) whereby individuals justify those beliefs to themselves and others are assessed according to informational criteria (Kruglanski, 1989, 1999). _x000D_
_x000D_
Many different theoretical accounts of conservatism over the past 50 years have stressed motivational underpinnings, but they have identified different needs as critical. Our review brings these diverse accounts together for the first time. Variables significantly associated with conservatism, we now know, include fear and aggression (Adorno et al., 1950; Altemeyer, 1998; Lavine et al., 1999), dogmatism and intolerance of ambiguity (Fibert & Ressler, 1998; Frenkel-Brunswik, 1948; Rokeach, 1960; Sidanius, 1978), uncertainty avoidance (McGregor et al., 2001; Sorrentino & Roney, 1986; Wilson, 1973b), need for cognitive closure (Golec, 2001; Jost et al., 1999; Kemmelmeier, 1997; Kruglanski & Webster, 1996), personal need for structure (Altemeyer, 1998; Schaller et al., 1995; Smith & Gordon, 1998), terror management (Dechesne et al., 2000; Greenberg et al., 1990, 1992; Wilson, 1973d), group-based dominance (Pratto et al., 1994; Sidanius, 1993; Sidanius & Pratto, 1999), and system justification (Jost & Banaji, 1994; Jost et al., 2001; Jost & Thompson, 2000). From our perspective, these psychological factors are capable of contributing to the adoption of conservative ideological contents, either independently or in combination. _x000D_
_x000D_
The socially constructed nature of human belief systems (see Jost & Kruglanski, 2002) makes it unlikely that a complete explanation of conservative ideology could ever be provided in terms of a single motivational syndrome. Ideologies, like other social representations, may be thought of as possessing a core and a periphery (Abric, 2001), and each may be fueled by separate motivational concerns. The most that can be expected of a general psychological analysis is for it to partially explain the core of political conservatism because the peripheral aspects are by definition highly protean and driven by historically changing, local contexts. _x000D_
_x000D_
We regard political conservatism as an ideological belief system that is significantly (but not completely) related to motivational concerns having to do with the psychological management of uncertainty and fear. Specifically, the avoidance of uncertainty (and the striving for certainty) may be particularly tied to one core dimension of conservative thought, resistance to change (Wilson, 1973c). Similarly, concerns with fear and threat may be linked to the second core dimension of conservatism, endorsement of inequality (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). Although resistance to change and support for inequality are conceptually distinguishable, we have argued that they are psychologically interrelated, in part because motives pertaining to uncertainty and threat are interrelated (e.g., Dechesne et al., 2000; McGregor et al., 2001; van den Bos & Miedema, 2000). _x000D_
_x000D_
In conclusion, our comprehensive review integrates several decades of research having to do with the psychological bases of political conservatism. Most of what is known about the psychology of conservatism fits exceedingly well with theories of motivated social cognition. The integrative framework developed here has implications for resolving historically controversial issues, and we have argued that it has great generative potential for guiding future work on the subject of conservatism. By attending to the multiple, potentially reinforcing influences of epistemic, existential, and ideological motivations involved in political conservatism, we hope that future research strengthens understanding of belief systems in general. It should also shed light on the nature of relations between the micro and the macro, that is, on the reciprocal dynamics between the needs of individual and group actors on one hand and the complex characteristics of social and political systems, institutions, and organizations on the other._x000D_","Analyzing political conservatism as motivated social cognition integrates theories of personality (authoritarianism, dogmatism-intolerance of ambiguity), epistemic and existential needs (for closure, regulatory focus, terror management), and ideological rationalization (social dominance, system justification). A meta-analysis (88 samples, 12 countries, 22,818 cases) confirms that several psychological variables predict political conservatism: death anxiety (weighted mean r=.50); system instability (.47); dogmatism-intolerance of ambiguity (.34); openness to experience (-.32); uncertainty tolerance (-.27); needs for order, structure, and closure (.26); integrative complexity (-.20); fear of threat and loss (.18); and self-esteem (-.09).

Social justice research, 20(1), 98-116.","To summarize, we have argued for three main points: (1) Human morality consists of more than what is covered by the traditional Kohlberg/Gilligan domains of justice and care. (2) Liberal morality rests primarily on these two foundations (we call them fairness/reciprocity and harm/care), whereas conservative morality rests on five foundations, including ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity concerns as well. (3) Recognizing these latter foundations as moral (instead of amoral, or immoral, or just plain stupid) can open up a door in the wall that separates liberals and conservatives when they try to discuss moral issues. We would love to have persuaded you on the first two points, but the third point is more important than our specific theory. Social justice researchers and activists have much to gain by opening their ears to the moral nature of arguments related to ingroup, authority, and purity, and much to lose if they do not. Even if social justice researchers never come to care about group cohesion, institutional integrity, or divinity as much as conservatives do, it will still be crucial for them to understand these cares, especially when they conflict with the virtues of compassion, justice, and equality that the social justice community values so dearly.

Jost et al. (2003) describe the core elements of conservatism as opposition to change and acceptance of inequality. They conclude that conservatism is associated empirically with a set of traits that make conservatives look rigid, authoritarian, and dumb: dogmatism, intolerance of ambiguity, high need for order, low cognitive complexity. They suggest that they have found an explanation for one of the central puzzles of social justice research: why do conservatives believe the things they believe? Their answer is: because conservatives have a particular pattern of epistemic and existential motives. This approach to conservatism reminds us of the old and probably apocryphal British newspaper headline: ‚ÄúFog in channel, continent cut off.‚Äù (Common sense would suggest that Britain, not Europe, was cut off.) Looking at the entire range of human societies, the statistically ‚Äúnormal‚Äù human society is built upon all five foundations. It is modern liberalism (not the ‚Äúcontinent‚Äù of all other cultures) which requires a special explanation. Why is it that in a minority of human cultures the moral domain has shrunk? How did it come to pass that in much of Europe, and in some parts of the United States, moral concerns have been restricted to issues related to harm/welfare/care and justice/rights/fairness? We believe that a team of historians and sociologists could easily tell such a story, probably involving references to the growth of free markets, social mobility, science, material wealth, and ethnic and religious diversity. Mobility and diversity make a morality based on shared valuation of traditions and institutions quite difficult (Whose traditions? Which institutions?). These factors help explain the electoral map of the United States in the 2004 presidential election. When viewed at the county level, the great majority of counties that voted for John Kerry are near major waterways, where ports and cities are usually located and where mobility and diversity are greatest. Areas with less mobility and less diversity generally have the more traditional five-foundation morality, and therefore were more likely to vote for George W. Bush‚Äîand to tell pollsters that their reason was ‚Äúmoral values.‚Äù

We agree with Jost et al. (2003) that much of conservatism can be understood as motivated social cognition, but we add this caveat: many of these motives are moral motives. The same, of course, goes for liberals. Social justice researchers might therefore benefit from stepping out of the ‚Äúgood versus evil‚Äù mindset that is often present in our conferences, our academic publications, and our private conversations. One psychological universal (part of the ingroup foundation) is that when you call someone evil you erect a protective moral wall between yourself and the other, and this wall prevents you from seeing or respecting the other‚Äôs point of view (Baumeister, 1997, calls this process ‚Äúthe myth of pure evil.‚Äù)

We end our paper with an appeal to a great liberal moral value: tolerance. If social justice researchers and activists want to make progress and be consistent with their own values, they will have to understand, respect, and work with the moral concerns of people with whom they disagree.","Researchers in moral psychology and social justice have agreed that morality is about matters of harm, rights, and justice. On this definition of morality, conservative opposition to social justice programs appears to be immoral, and has been explained as a product of various non-moral processes such as system justification or social dominance orientation. In this article we argue that, from an anthropological perspective, the moral domain is usually much broader, encompassing many more aspects of social life and valuing institutions as much or more than individuals. We present theoretical and empirical reasons for believing that there are five psychological systems that provide the foundations for the world‚Äôs many moralities. The five foundations are psychological preparations for detecting and reacting emotionally to issues related to harm/care, fairness/reciprocity, ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity. Political liberals have moral intuitions primarily based upon the first two foundations, and therefore misunderstand the moral motivations of political conservatives, who generally rely upon all five foundations.","5",0,"5","Political",5,0

Journal of personality and social psychology, 77(6), 1213.","The goal of this research was to investigate how the salience of racial stereotypes about athletes influence Black and White participants' performance on a sports-oriented task. The results of both experiments provided evidence to suggest that making salient negative racial stereotypes about Black and White athletes has the potential to cause poorer athletic performance in these groups relative to when they perform an athletic task in a positive or neutral evaluative context. The current findings shed new light on the phenomenon of stereotype threat (Steele, 1997; Steele & Aronson, 1995) and add to our understanding of the social psychological factors that influence motivation and performance. _x000D_
_x000D_
The present evidence for stereotype threat among White participants extends the theory and research on stereotype threat by documenting that majority group members may suffer from the negative effect of being stereotyped according to their racial identity. Overall, the data are consistent with our claim that when made salient, natural athletic ability activates a culturally shared negative stereotype about White athletes. Knowledge of the negative beliefs about their natural athletic ability, in turn, creates threat in the mind of the White athlete for whom performance represents an important measure of their self-worth. The threat of demonstrating poor athletic ability, through mechanisms discussed below, subsequently impedes the athletic performance of Whites. These findings further support Steele's (1997) contention that stereotype threat is a general psychological phenomenon that could have a negative impact on the performance and self-evaluation of any group member, including traditionally nonstigmatized individuals such as White college students (cf. Aronson et al., 1999; Croizet & Claire, 1998). _x000D_
_x000D_
The data from Experiment 1 indicate that negative racial stereotypes about Black athletes can have similar adverse consequences. The negative stereotype about the innate intelligence of Blacks appears to permeate even a domain such as sports in which Blacks are successful at the collegiate and professional level. The belief that Blacks are naturally gifted but unintelligent athletes may reflect the general cultural stereotype about the innate intelligence of Blacks (Steele, 1997), or it may stem from racist needs to derogate Blacks because of their success in athletics (Davis, 1990; Harris, 1993). Whatever its origin, it too appears to represent a culturally shared belief that is known to Blacks who participate in sports. And, just as making a connection between race and intelligence has been shown to decrease performance in the domain of academics (e.g., Steele & Aronson, 1995), when made salient in a sports performance context, the negative stereotype about the intelligence of Black athletes can impede their performance in sports. One implication of this finding is that the psychological processes engaged by stereotype threat for some target groups (e.g., Blacks, women) in one context may operate in another context, if cues that activate the same stereotyped dimension (i.e., intelligence, math ability) are made salient prior to performance on a task. The conditions under which targets generalize stereotype threat processes across performance domains are an important direction for future research. _x000D_
_x000D_
How Does Stereotype Threat Impede Athletic Performance? _x000D_
Several potential mediators of how stereotype threat interferes with effective athletic performance were measured in the current experiments. The overall picture sketched by the findings is somewhat complex; it appears that the battle to reduce stereotype threat impedes athletic performance in part because concern about confirming the stereotype increases anxiety and in part because it creates self-doubt about the ability to perform. The threat of confirming a negative stereotype about one's athletic potential appears to set into motion a sequence of psychological processes that ultimately inhibit the ability to perform up to one's capacity. _x000D_
_x000D_
There was some evidence that after a negative stereotype about one's race was made salient in the performance context, people for whom the stereotype represented a significant threat to their selfworth experienced concern that they might confirm the stereotype's veracity through their own performance. For example, in Experiment 1, Black participants in the sports intelligence condition and White participants in the natural athletic ability condition both reported increased anxiety from pre- to posttest, but participants in the control conditions showed either decreases or very little change in anxiety from pre- to posttest. Whereas the selfreport measures did not correlate significantly with performance in these conditions, the effect of the misattribution cue on performance in Experiment 2 suggests that if the situation can provide a diversion from this concern, individuals under threat of confirming a negative stereotype are able to perform at the same level as those who do not perceive stereotype threat. Performance anxiety appears to be part of the experience of stereotype threat, and whereas we did not find direct evidence of mediation, it may indirectly contribute to the poor performances shown to follow from the salience of a negative stereotype (e.g., Steele & Aronson, 1995; Spencer et al., 1999). _x000D_
_x000D_
The data suggest that concern over confirming the stereotype may also lead targets to lower their expectations for performance in the situation. Those participants most threatened by the negative athletic stereotype in Experiment 2 reported lower expectations for performance compared with those participants not threatened by the stereotype (e.g., disengaged participants or participants threatened by the stereotype but for whom the misattribution cue was salient). However, inspection of the relationship between performance and expectancies on each hole (see Footnote 4) indicated that participants may have lowered their expectations in reaction to their initial poor performance on the first hole of the course. We also did not find self-report evidence that engaged participants reduced their effort on the task when stereotype threat was salient. This suggests that targets do not necessarily lower their expectations once the negative stereotype is salient, but rather, they may lower expectations following the first indication that their performance might confirm the veracity of the negative stereotype. Thus, lowered expectations may have contributed to the poor performance by those most affected by stereotype threat, but in the current data, threatened participants did not lower their expectations until after they had initially performed poorly. Given the interplay between expectancies and performance under stereotype threat in the current research, it is clear that more research is needed to better understand the role played by expectancies in stereotype threat phenomena. _x000D_
_x000D_
In summary, the current data suggest that stereotype threat impedes performance, because the threat of confirming a negative stereotype about one's racial identity creates anxiety and selfdoubt in the target individual. When a negative stereotype is salient in a performance domain, such as when taking an advanced academic exam or performing in a sports event, the ""suspicion of inability,"" which raises doubt about the ability to perform, and the concomitant frustration or anxiety about the predicament may combine to overcome the capacity to perform effectively. Factors that reduce the impact of the threat, such as the importance of the performance to one's self-worth, or factors that reduce the effects of anxiety and self-doubt directly, such as something in the context that can refocus them on the task, may hold these processes in check and allow the targets of stereotype threat to perform up to their potential. _x000D_
_x000D_
Coping With Stereotype Threat in Sports _x000D_
Both experiments provided evidence that psychological discounting and disengagement processes play a role in how individuals attempt to cope with stereotype threat (e.g., Major & Schmader, 1998). In Experiment 1, after they had completed the golf test that was framed as diagnostic of natural athletic ability, White participants rated the test as significantly more biased against their natural athletic ability than did participants in the other conditions. Challenging the validity of the test in this way suggests that White athletes were attempting to discount their performance as diagnostic of their perceived athletic ability. Black participants, however, did not similarly discount the validity of the test when it was framed as a measure of their sports intelligence. We cannot offer a definitive explanation for this group difference based on the present research, but one possibility is that the race of the experimenter may have played a role. As Steele and Aronson (1995) showed, subtle indicators of the link between performance and a negative social identity are capable of engaging stereotype threat processes. If the race or gender of an evaluator can serve as a cue for bias in a testing situation, then it is possible that the Black experimenter in Experiment 1 served as such a cue for White participants, but not for Black participants, to challenge the validity of the test. We note further that in Experiment 2, White participants did not discount their performance when the test was framed as a measure of natural athletic ability, but the experimenter was also White. If the race of the experimenter did play a role, it might indicate that subtle contextual cues are not only capable of signaling the threat of verifying a negative stereotype about one's social group, but they may also be capable of cueing the use of specific strategies for coping in response to the perceived threat. _x000D_
_x000D_
In Experiment 2, the chronic tendency to disengage one's selfworth from the outcome of an athletic performance significantly moderated the relationship between stereotype threat and performance in the athletic performance test. However, it is difficult to know what the effect for chronic disengagement indicates about the psychological coping mechanisms that promoted a good performance on the test. We measured several variables to provide some indication, and the only variable that correlated significantly with the measure of disengagement was the measure of the importance performance in sports had for their sense of self-worth. Disengaged participants' ratings of athletics as less important to their self-worth could suggest that they identified less with the domain of athletics compared with engaged participants, and therefore, cared less about performing well on the golf test. We doubt this interpretation, however, because disengaged participants rated themselves to be above average athletes both before and after their performance. In addition, they performed relatively well on the golf test in each of the experimental conditions, which indicates that they were not coping with stereotype threat by withdrawing interest or effort during their performance. _x000D_
_x000D_
The data are more compatible with a ""devaluing"" process whereby people reduce the importance of performance in a domain to maintain perceptions of global self-worth (e.g., Major. & Schmader, 1998; see also James, 1890/1952; Tesser, 1988). With respect to athletics, chronically disengaged sports participants may represent people who participate in organized sports and consider themselves to be athletic but who do not rely on their performance in sports as a basis for evaluating their overall self-worth. Consequently, when faced with the salience of the negative stereotype about White athletes, it did not impair their performance because confirming the negative characterization was not perceived as a threat to their global self-esteem. Chronically engaged sports participants, in contrast, not only may identify themselves as athletic but also may rely on their performance in sports for their perceptions of overall self-worth. As a result, the potential for a poor performance was perceived as a threat to their global self-worth, and their concern interfered with their ability to perform. A direction for future research is to investigate how people who are disengaged from a performance outcome, but who identify with the domain, perceive and respond to the threat of confirming a negative stereotype about a social identity. _x000D_
_x000D_
Conclusions _x000D_
The present research showed that the salience of stereotype threat in the context of an athletic performance can adversely affect the performance of both Black and White individuals who play sports. Referring back to Allport's (1954) observations, we find that the current data support his assumption that once targets become aware that they are being evaluated in terms of a negative stereotype, they become intensely concerned about being labeled and treated in terms of the negative characterization. The concern they feel appears to overwhelm their ability to think and perform as well as they do when a negative stereotype is not made salient in the situation. Thus, the challenge to the self imposed by the salience of a negative stereotype about an important social identity appears to consume the very resources that targets require to overcome the threat. _x000D_
_x000D_
The specific conditions of stereotype threat that lead to poorer athletic performance, however, are different for various groups. For example, Blacks suffer when the stereotype concerning their supposed poor sports intelligence is made salient, whereas Whites suffer when the stereotype concerning their supposed poor natural athletic ability is made salient. The problems that follow from stereotype threat salience appear to occur primarily among individuals for whom sports performance is important to their sense of self-worth. It also appears that contextual factors, such as the way in which performance is framed and cues that distract people from thinking about the negative stereotype, can reduce the harmful impact of a salient negative stereotype. The current data suggest that stereotype threat processes stem from the context in which targets perform, and the implication is that changes in the performance context can reduce the negative impact that stereotypes can have when they are brought to mind (e.g., Crocker, 1999; Steele, 1997)._x000D_","Two experiments showed that framing an athletic task as diagnostic of negative racial stereotypes about Black or White athletes can impede their performance in sports. In Experiment 1, Black participants performed significantly worse than did control participants when performance on a golf task was framed as diagnostic of ""sports intelligence."" In comparison, White participants performed worse than did control participants when the golf task was framed as diagnostic of 'natural athletic ability."" Experiment 2 observed the effect of stereotype threat on the athletic performance of White participants for whom performance in sports represented a significant measure of their self-worth. The implications of the findings for the theory of stereotype threat (C. M. Steele, 1997) and for participation in sports are discussed. ","2",0,"2","Political",3,0

Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 40(12), 1559-1573.","The present research sheds light on the conditions under which moral foundation frames (Graham et al., 2013; Haidt & Graham, 2007) can affect people‚Äôs political attitudes. Two studies exposed liberals and conservatives to a variety of sociopolitical issues framed in terms of five moral foundations. In Study 1, the stances on issues were pro-attitudinal for conservatives (e.g., less economic regulation), whereas Study 2 examined the same topics, but pro-attitudinal stances for liberals (e.g., more economic regulation). Across studies, political attitudes changed depending on whether or not the issue stances were pro-attitudinal and‚Äîto some extent‚Äîwhether the moral frames were relevant (harm and fairness for liberals; ingroup, authority, and purity for conservatives)._x000D_
_x000D_
Both studies found consistent evidence in support of our entrenching hypothesis. That is, exposure to relevant moral frames of pro-attitudinal stances on issues led to more entrenched political attitudes as compared with participants not exposed to moral frames. In Study 1, conservatives who viewed and reflected on conservative stances (on the economy, education, immigration, etc.), framed by the authority and purity moral foundations, bolstered their conservative attitudes. Likewise, in Study 2, liberals exposed to liberal stances on the same issues, framed by the harm and fairness foundations, increased their liberal attitudes. Thus, these studies provide some evidence that relevant moral foundations can strengthen existing political attitudes._x000D_
_x000D_
We found mixed support for our persuasion hypothesis, that is, the possibility that moral foundations can persuade individuals to change their political attitudes when counter-attitudinal stances are framed using relevant moral foundations. In Study 1, when exposed to conservative stances on issues, relevant moral foundation frames did not convince liberals to hold more conservative attitudes. However, in Study 2, conservatives indicated relatively more liberal attitudes following exposure to conservative-relevant moral frames of liberal stances on issues. Therefore, we have preliminary evidence, for conservatives, that relevant moral frames may facilitate crossing the political divide. As liberals also increased their liberal attitudes on liberal stances in response to the three conservative moral frames in Study 2, additional research may help clarify these unexpected findings._x000D_
_x000D_
In addition to building on moral foundations theory (Graham et al., 2013; Haidt, 2012), the present studies also extend prior research on moral foundations and political attitude change. Specific to the issue of the environment, conservatives have been persuaded to adopt more liberal attitudes when exposed to the conservative-relevant purity frame (Feinberg & Willer, 2013). This finding is consistent with the pattern observed in Study 2. However, instead of the entrenching pattern found in both of our studies, in the past study, liberals‚Äô attitudes were not detected to change following exposure to a liberal-relevant harm frame (Feinberg & Willer, 2013). It is possible that these prior results were due to the specific issue selected, the content of the study materials, or the sample of liberal and conservative participants. The present research attempted to allay these concerns, in part, by examining multiple issues, using all five moral foundations, and including both liberal and conservative perspectives across two samples. Future research using the five moral foundations, different issues, and mixed methodology may further generalize the current pattern of effects._x000D_
_x000D_
Although the present research was designed to test the effects of moral foundations on political attitudes, we could speculate on the processes involved. In both studies, participants in the experimental condition were exposed to moral frames and generated supporting arguments for the liberal or conservative stances on issues. In terms of the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986), moral foundations may be factors that change political attitudes through either the peripheral or the central routes. Is it simply exposure to moral frames that affects attitude change, or is more careful deliberation of information necessary? First, consider exposure to pro-attitudinal stances on issues. In this context, people may not think carefully about a stance on an issue that is already congruent with their views (e.g., Kunda, 1990). Consistent with the peripheral route, it is therefore conceivable that exposure to subtle, moral foundation language may cue individuals‚Äô moral intuitions, which may directly lead to more favorable (entrenched) attitudes. Because this pattern was found consistently for relevant moral frames, this suggests that this process may hinge on moral cues that ‚Äúfeel right‚Äù or seem important (e.g., Cesario et al., 2004; Graham et al., 2009). Alternatively, and more aligned with the central route, moral frames that are relevant may make issues seem more significant to individuals. This could lead to more thorough processing of the issues and may lead to more confidence in people‚Äôs thoughts on issues. Such greater confidence in pro-attitudinal thoughts could lead to more polarized attitudes (e.g., Petty, Bri√±ol, & Tormala, 2002). Similar processes may occur when individuals are exposed to counter-attitudinal stances on issues. However, as people may be more motivated to defend their political beliefs in a counter-attitudinal context, it is conceivable that some type of central route processes may be necessary for moral frames to persuade political attitudes. In the present studies, we asked participants to write supporting arguments for the morally framed stances, but not their freely formed thoughts. Although we found that the moral frames affected the moral content of their supporting points, the degree of moral content did not explain final political attitudes. Thus, these analyses provide limited insight into the processes involved. For example, participants‚Äô positive or negative thoughts about the issues may have differed from their written statements, which were instructed to be consistent with the stances on the issues. Thus, it would be informative if future research more directly tested whether processes that are peripheral or central (e.g., increased thought confidence) can help explain how relevant moral frames induce attitude change. Additional research could also examine whether political attitudes can be shifted through other persuasive means involving moral foundations. For example, prior research on persuasion has examined various peripheral cues (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986). Moral framing could also operate via alternative peripheral mediums, such as images that capture moral foundation meanings (Pizarro, Detweiler-Bedell, & Bloom, 2006)._x000D_
_x000D_
The asymmetry of support for the persuasion hypothesis in Studies 1 and 2 between liberals and conservatives was not predicted. Emerging research, however, provides a possible explanation for this pattern of results. Contrary to lay beliefs and researchers‚Äô predictions, recent studies have revealed that liberal ideology is more consistently (rigidly) held than conservative ideology (Kesebir, Philips, Anson, Pyszczynski, & Motyl, 2013). That is, across studies and political issues, liberals‚Äô political beliefs show less variation and more consistent support for liberal stances on issues. However, conservatives‚Äô opinions align with a range of political beliefs (i.e., greater within-person variability) on conservative as well as liberal viewpoints (Kesebir et al., 2013). This suggests that liberals may find it relatively easy to identify where they stand on morally framed issues, perhaps especially making conflicting views more apparent and less persuasive. Conservatives, however, may hold various degrees of support for different topics, potentially leading to persuasion in the direction of morally framed issues. More insight into this pattern may be garnered by conducting additional research on the consistency of the pattern of the present results and by testing the processes involved._x000D_
_x000D_
Limitations_x000D_
The generalizability of the results of these studies is partly confined to our operationalizations of the moral foundations. In terms of specific moral foundations, across studies, the ingroup moral foundation showed inconsistent effects for those with a more conservative orientation. In both studies, we used references to America and Americans to frame the ingroup moral foundation. In Study 1, the authority and purity frames entrenched conservatives‚Äô attitudes, but the ingroup frame did not. In Study 2, the ingroup frame persuaded conservatives (and also liberals) to adopt relatively more liberal attitudes. Given that the American ingroup may include many groups for participants in our samples, such references may be more useful for persuading conservatives to adopt typically non-conservative views, but less useful for entrenching conservative views. Instead, perhaps more proximal ingroup references may be more applicable, such as relating to one‚Äôs political party, family, or social class. These variations would still fit within the ingroup moral foundation, and would corroborate observations of some conservatives differentiating between various groups of U.S. citizens as ‚Äútrue‚Äù Americans or not (Frank, 2004). Future research could determine whether degree of ingroup closeness, or variations in the operationalizations of the other moral foundations, affects moral framing-related attitude change._x000D_
_x000D_
There are other limitations on the generalizability of our findings. In both studies, participants tended to be well educated and slightly below average in perceived socioeconomic standing. They also volunteered to complete tasks related to current issues. Although controlling for a variety of background characteristics did not affect the results in either study, future research could study the effects of moral foundation-based frames using a variety of groups from different settings, including those that are more varied in education, SES, and interest in current events._x000D_
_x000D_
We collected data from more than 1,000 participants in the present research. We aimed to have a similar number of participants in each study to facilitate the reliability of theoretical comparisons between studies. Our recruitment efforts resulted in approximately 560 participants in each study that identified along the liberal‚Äìconservative continuum. We believe that this number of participants provided us with adequate power to test for the effects of our manipulations in samples that varied in political orientation. Although we acknowledge that larger samples would increase the power to replicate our results (e.g., Perugini, Gallucci, & Costantini, 2014), we note that the relatively moderate sample sizes used reduce the likelihood that our findings were minute effects that can sometimes be detected in very large sample sizes._x000D_
_x000D_
Implications_x000D_
The present research contributes to the study of moral and political psychology by specifying some conditions in which moral foundations can affect political attitudes. Our strongest evidence across studies has implications when the relevant moral foundations are known (e.g., in an organization, team, political party, etc.). Capitalizing on this information may be useful for rallying support behind issues. For instance, in U.S. politics, perhaps the relative lack of moral framing led Democrats to lose in the 2004 federal election (Haidt, 2012), and was ‚Äúa major reason‚Äù that Democrats lost the House of Representatives in the 2010 election (Lakoff & Wehling, 2012, p. 32). We cannot confirm these assertions; however, the present research suggests that when addressing a liberal or conservative audience, on liberal or conservative stances, respectively, discussions framed using relevant moral foundations may embolden support. Consistent with the procedure of the present research, this may involve encouraging individuals to reflect on topics that are framed with relevant moral foundations. Although the present research focused on political issues, similar effects may be found in communities, groups, or workplaces, when presenting ideas broadly (e.g., social policy, marketing, health communication, etc.) that are framed in terms of relevant moral foundations. Future research could confirm these possibilities._x000D_

Conclusion_x000D_
Prior research has established that liberals and conservatives differ in the moral foundations they find to be more relevant‚Äîharm and fairness for liberals, and ingroup, authority, and purity for conservatives (Graham et al., 2009). However, the extent that all five of these moral foundations facilitate broad changes in political attitudes was previously unclear. The present research demonstrated that the political attitudes of conservatives and liberals can be affected by exposure to moral foundations, in particular, when the moral foundations are relevant to the target audience. Although we conducted a broad test of the role of moral foundations in changing political attitudes, our examination was also relatively straightforward. Future research may benefit from testing the effects of complex combinations of moral foundations and applying the framework used in the present research across varied domains and settings._x000D_","People‚Äôs social and political opinions are grounded in their moral concerns about right and wrong. We examine whether five moral foundations‚Äîharm, fairness, ingroup, authority, and purity‚Äîcan influence political attitudes of liberals and conservatives across a variety of issues. Framing issues using moral foundations may change political attitudes in at least two possible ways: (a) Entrenching: Relevant moral foundations will strengthen existing political attitudes when framing pro-attitudinal issues (e.g., conservatives exposed to a free-market economic stance) and (b) Persuasion: Mere presence of relevant moral foundations may also alter political attitudes in counter-attitudinal directions (e.g., conservatives exposed to an economic regulation stance). Studies 1 and 2 support the entrenching hypothesis. Relevant moral foundation-based frames bolstered political attitudes for conservatives (Study 1) and liberals (Study 2). Only Study 2 partially supports the persuasion hypothesis. Conservative-relevant moral frames of liberal issues increased conservatives‚Äô liberal attitudes.","2",0,"2","Political",4,1
54,10,"Gerlach, P. (2017). The games economists play: Why economics students behave more selfishly than other students. PloS one, 12(9), e0183814.","This study demonstrated that, relative to their fellow students, economics students offered less in a third-party punishment game; they were about equally likely concerned with fairness, and they had a similar understanding of what was fair. However, economics students expected to receive smaller offers from others, which in turn mediated their own smaller offers. Moreover, economics students were less willing to veto unfair allocation of others. Taken together, the results suggest that economics students‚Äô more selfish behavior is not due different fairness standards but to social norms. _x000D_
_x000D_
Several limitations to this investigation and the conclusions that may be drawn from it warrant consideration. Foremost, economics students‚Äô expectations only partly mediated the offers they made, which suggests that their greater skepticism is not the only explanation for their more selfish behavior. Further, participants may have decided how much to offer before forming expectations about others. If this were the case, causality would be reversed, with decisions informing expectations (in the sense ‚ÄúIf I do B in the situation of class A, expect B to be the rule for situations of class A‚Äù). Reverse causality was addressed primarily through the study design: expectations were measured before participants decided on an offer. Nonetheless, it cannot be completely ruled out that participants made a hypothetical decision immediately after reading the instructions [48]. _x000D_
_x000D_
Moreover, offers in the third party punishment game cannot be unequivocally interpret as due to non-selfish motives only. As suggested by some of the participants‚Äô comments, high offers can be due to strategic motives, to avoid vetoing. Although studies suggest that offers in the third party punishment positively and strongly correlate with established measures of selfishness [46] and the proposer‚Äôs offers primarily served as a replication of economics students‚Äô greater propensity to behave selfishly, a combination of experimental games would have been preferable to directly test the economics students‚Äô more selfish motives. Such combination of experimental games could also shed light on differences in the motives to veto. In the particular version of the third party punishment game vetoing always caused judges to earn less than what one or both other participants would earn. However, third party punishment in general can be motivated not only by norm enforcement but also by spiteful motives [49]. Further experiments could not only assess the students‚Äô differences in their motives to veto but also test a central assumption of the social norms hypothesis, namely whether economics students and other students are similarly motivated to comply with social norms._x000D_
_x000D_
Another limitation is the cross-sectional design of the study. Why are economics students more skeptical in the first place? There are two possible explanations. One is that people who are more skeptical and behave more selfishly are drawn to study economics (self-selection hypothesis). The other explanation is that economics students learn to associate specific situations with more selfish behaviors (socialization hypothesis). It is also possible that both explanations hold. The two effects have been extensively discussed in the literature ([50,51]; see [52] for an overview). In the specific context of experimental games, the findings of cross-sectional studies that correlate academic year with choices are frequently interpreted as pointing to socialization [5,8,14] rather than self-selection [4], suggesting that economics students learn to behave more selfishly over the course of their studies. This interpretation, however, must not be valid. A positive correlation of selfish behaviors with study year could be as much due to learning (socialization) as to a systematic dropping out of less selfish economics students (selfselection) as to a third factor, such as the effect of aging in general. Cross-sectional data simply cannot be used for inferring changes within a sample over time. To assess the underlying mechanisms of what is driving the more selfish behavior of economics students longitudinal data sets that include a control group are required. _x000D_
_x000D_
It is nonetheless possible to speculate that the body of theories on human behavior to which economics students are exposed during their studies can explain their greater skepticism and their more selfish behavior. Economic theories have traditionally been more concerned with the mathematical structure of the decision problem than with the psychology of the individual [53]. Rational choice theory, arguably one of the centerpieces of modern economic theory [54] and the starting point of game theory [55], frames decision-making as a calculative, emotionless weighing of the costs and the benefits of options. Although rational choice theory primarily serves to describe decision-making, its application to social situations may cause economics students to interpret a situation differently, ultimately leading to different choices [56‚Äì58]. For example, Fiske argued that in Western cultures taking calculative approaches to social relations is associated with greater psychological distance [59], less intense moral obligations [60], and more selfishness [61]. Economics students may thus not only learn rational choice theory but also learn to associate it with a specific behavior that they in turn expect from others. Rubinstein, for example, pointed out that students who come to the university ‚Äúto ‚Äòstudy economics‚Äô instead become experts in mathematical manipulations‚Äù [62]. As a consequence, economics students may be more committed to maximize profits rather than to sympathize with other individuals. Especially through being exposed to game theory in their studies, economics students who participate in game experiments find themselves in social situations for which they have learned the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù calculative approach [5]. This does not necessarily mean that economics students are more skeptical and behave more selfishly outside the context of games. Research combining game experiments with field studies would be needed to test how well the choices of economics students‚Äîand other students‚Äîactually predict their behavior outside the laboratory. _x000D_
_x000D_
The fact that economics students behave more selfishly than other students is rather critical for experimental practice. Experimental games aim at extrapolating findings from the laboratory to the world beyond [63]. Yet most experimental games are exclusively conducted among university students‚Äîespecially economics students [64]. Although research suggest that students behave rather similar to non-student population groups [64,65] variation within the student participant pool is frequently neglected, potentially constraining generalization. _x000D_
_x000D_
Conclusion _x000D_
To conclude, this study demonstrated that economics students behaved more selfishly than other students in a third-party punishment game. Analyses of three mechanisms potentially underlying this pattern of results suggest that the more selfish behavior is not due to differences in fairness concerns or notions of fairness, but to the greater skepticism among economics students. This finding sheds new light on the debate about potential links between studying economics and selfish behavior. Selfish behavior is not free from context and can have different motives. In some contexts, economics students behave more selfishly because they expect others to do so._x000D_","Do economics students behave more selfishly than other students? Experiments involving monetary allocations suggest so. This article investigates the underlying motives for the economic students‚Äô more selfish behavior by separating three potential explanatory mechanisms: economics students are less concerned with fairness when making allocation decisions; have a different notion of what is fair in allocations; or are more skeptical about other people‚Äôs allocations, which in turn makes them less willing to comply with a shared fairness norm. The three mechanisms were tested by inviting students from various disciplines to participate in a relatively novel experimental game and asking all participants to give reasons for their choices. Compared with students of other disciplines, economics students were about equally likely to mention fairness in their comments; had a similar notion of what was fair in the situation; however, they expected lower offers, made lower offers, and were less willing to enforce compliance with a fair allocation at a cost to themselves. The economics students‚Äô lower expectations mediated their allocation decisions, suggesting that economics students behaved more selfishly because they expected others not to comply with the shared fairness norm.","Apolitical",1,"4","Political",3,0

Review of Economics and Statistics, 1-43.","In this section, we examine and document potential mechanisms through which mass shootings may affect local economies. Based on our conceptual framework, we characterize these mechanisms as internal and external._x000D_
_x000D_
A. Internal Mechanisms: Consumer Expectations and Labor Productivity_x000D_
In this section, we analyze the internal mechanisms that may explain the effect of mass shootings on economic outcomes. We first examine the effect of mass shootings on consumer sentiment. In table 4, columns 1 to 4 (panel A), we analyze how mass shootings impact personal finance, business conditions, consumption decisions, and expectations about future economic conditions. In all estimations, we include individual controls (age, age squared, gender, education categories, and marital status) and weight observations by sample weights._x000D_
_x000D_
In column 1, we do not see that respondents in counties with mass shootings are more likely to say that their personal finances are worse now relative to one year ago. The coefficient is economically small and statistically insignificant at the 10% level. In column 2, we document that respondents are 4.6 percentage points (mean of the dependent variable is 56.9) more likely to report that business conditions are worse now relative to a year ago. In column 3, we find that respondents are not more likely to cite that it is a bad time to buy major household items relative to one year ago. The coefficient is economically small and statistically insignificant at the 10% level. Last, in column 4, we document that mass shootings lead respondents to become pessimistic about their future personal finances. We see that respondents are 2.1 percentage points (mean of the dependent variable is 13.5) more likely to report that their personal finances would worsen one year from now._x000D_
_x000D_
These results suggest that mass shootings are negative shocks to household wealth and are directly responsible for household economic decision-making, as they negatively affect current business conditions and expectations about future personal finances._x000D_
_x000D_
Next, we explore whether mass shootings impact the economy by affecting the mental health of the labor force. Specifically, we use the BRFSS to measure whether mass shootings lead to negative health outcomes. In panel B, columns 1 to 3 of table 4 present the estimates. In all estimations, we include individual controls (age, age squared, gender, education categories, and marital status) and weight observations by sample weights. We restrict our sample to two years around mass shootings for counties with mass shootings and all observations for other counties.23_x000D_
_x000D_
In column 1, we see that the number of days respondents report having poor overall health increases, on average, by 0.36 days (mean of the dependent variable is 5.6) in counties with mass shootings relative to other counties. In column 2, we see that respondents are not more likely to report having poor physical health in counties with mass shootings relative to other counties. The coefficient is both economically small in magnitude and statistically insignificant at the 10% level. Finally, in column 3, we see that the number of days respondents report having poor mental health increases, on average, by 0.30 days (mean of the dependent variable is 3.2) in counties with mass shootings relative to other counties._x000D_
_x000D_
Appendix figures A5(a), A5(b), and A5(c) illustrate the effect of mass shootings on overall health, poor physical health, and poor mental health for each period around a mass shooting, respectively. The year before the shooting is the omitted category. The patterns presented in these figures confirm our estimates presented in table 4; we find that the decrease in overall health after a mass shooting is driven by a decrease in mental health. The point estimates for overall health and mental health are small and statistically insignificant for the four years prior to the shooting._x000D_
_x000D_
To sum up, the effect of mass shootings on health is driven by mental health deterioration among the labor force. This finding is consistent with Rossin-Slater et al. (2020), who find a large, persistent negative impact of school shootings on mental health among youths. These results suggest that mass shootings increase the likelihood that poor health, especially poor mental health, makes residents of targeted counties unable to engage in their usual activities such as work. It is thus plausible that shootings may decrease labor productivity or lead to an increase in absenteeism due to poor health._x000D_
_x000D_
B. External Mechanisms: Housing Prices, Migration, and Media Coverage_x000D_
We now turn to external mechanisms. In appendix table A14, we investigate whether mass shootings impact migration patterns. We find that mass shootings do not result in a change in population or migration into affected counties, showing that the composition and total labor force remain unchanged.24 In the aftermath of a disaster, long-term earnings have been shown to increase due to reduced labor supply (e.g., Groen et al., 2020). Our null result on population and migration suggests that earnings do not recover in counties with mass shootings, perhaps due to the lack of a reduction in labor supply._x000D_
_x000D_
We then analyze the effect of mass shootings on housing prices. Housing represents the greatest component of household wealth, with, on average, over 60% of household wealth held in home equity (Banks et al., 2004). Table 4, column 4 (panel B), shows the estimates. We see that housing prices decrease by approximately 1.6% in counties with mass shootings relative to other counties. According to hedonic pricing models of housing, this result of the decreased valuation of housing in affected areas, in conjunction with no change in population in the affected counties, suggests that the demand for housing decreases in affected areas._x000D_
_x000D_
We now test whether media coverage exacerbates the negative economic outcomes of mass shootings. It is difficult to answer this question because the national media coverage of mass shootings is likely to be endogenous. For instance, mass shootings that occur close to the county population center may be more likely to receive higher national media coverage. Simultaneously, these mass shootings likely have a stronger effect on the county‚Äôs economic outcomes. This may lead to a downward bias in the OLS estimates._x000D_
_x000D_
To establish the causal impact of media coverage of mass shootings on the economic outcome, we use news pressure on the day of the shooting. We also include the fact that natural disasters on the day of a mass shooting may lead to less extensive coverage crowd out the news on the shooting entirely. Conceptually, our approach is similar to the news pressure first employed by Eisensee and Stromberg (2007)._x000D_
_x000D_
Specifically, we implement an instrumental variable strategy where we predict the news coverage of mass shootings in a first stage by whether it occurs during the time of a natural disaster. We use the exact dates of the shootings and natural disasters to characterize whether a mass shooting occurs during a natural disaster. We then omit natural disasters that occur within the same state on the day of a mass shooting to reduce concerns about violation of exclusion restrictions.25 Overall, 42 mass shootings occur during a natural disaster. We then use this predicted media coverage of each shooting in the second stage to estimate the impact of media coverage of mass shootings on economic outcomes. We focus only on (successful) mass shootings in the year of the shooting for our analysis. We estimate the following specification:_x000D_
Mediacst=Œ≥s+œÅdt+œÄNDcst+MS-deathscstŒª+ucst,ŒîYcst=Œ≥s+œÅdt+Œ≤Mediacst^+Xcst'Œ≥+…õcst, (3)_x000D_
where Mediacst measures the5 media coverage of the mass shooting in the national media (either the number of news stories or the total duration of news stories). NDcst equals one if there is a natural disaster in the United States on the exact date of the shooting and zero otherwise.26ŒîYcst is the change in the economic variable of interest from the previous year. Mediacst^ is the predicted media coverage from the first stage. MS-deaths controls for the total number of individuals killed in the mass shooting._x000D_
_x000D_
In the specification, we use first-difference in economic outcome to absorb county-specific time-invariant factors.27 Our strategy is only able to capture the contemporaneous effect of the media coverage of mass shootings on economic outcomes.28_x000D_
_x000D_
Appendix table A15 shows estimates of the first stage. We obtain a Montiel-Pueger F Statistic (Olea & Pflueger, 2013) of 9.4 and 7.4 in columns 1 and 2, respectively, showing that our instrument is relevant. We see that mass shootings that occur the same day as a natural disaster attract 3.4 fewer stories (mean of dependent variable 6.6) and receive 11.7 fewer minutes of news coverage (mean of dependent variable 24.38) relative to mass shootings that occur at other times._x000D_
_x000D_
Table 5 shows the results from the OLS estimation (columns 1, 3, and 5) and the second stage (columns 2, 4, and 6). In panel A, the main independent variable is the number of news stories in the national media. The OLS estimate in column 1 shows that the estimate of media coverage is economically small and statistically insignificant. However, the IV estimate in column 2 shows that national media coverage of mass shootings leads to a decrease in employment. One additional news story on a mass shooting in the national media leads to a 0.44% decrease in employment per capita. In column 3, we see that the OLS estimate of the effect of media coverage on real earnings is statistically insignificant. The IV estimate in column 4, however, shows that national media coverage of mass shootings leads to a decrease in earnings. For example, one additional news story on a mass shooting in the national media leads to a 0.82% decrease in earnings per capita. In columns 5 and 6, we see that media coverage does not impact establishments per capita._x000D_
_x000D_
In panel B, the main independent variable is the duration of news stories on mass shootings (in minutes) in the national media. The OLS estimate in column 1 shows that the estimate of media coverage is economically small and statistically insignificant. The IV estimate in column 2, however, shows that the duration of the national media coverage of mass shootings leads to a decrease in employment. One additional minute of a news story on a mass shooting in the national media leads to a 0.13% decrease in employment per capita. In column 3, we see that the OLS estimate of the effect of the duration of media coverage on real earnings is statistically insignificant. However, the IV estimate in column 4 shows that the duration of national media coverage of mass shootings leads to a decrease in earnings. One additional news story on a mass shooting in the national media leads to a 0.24% decrease in earnings per capita. In columns 5 and 6, we see that media coverage does not impact establishments per capita. Together, these results reveal that greater national media coverage of mass shootings exacerbates their local economic impact._x000D_
_x000D_
VII. Conclusion_x000D_
This paper provides one of the first detailed accounts of the economic consequences of mass shootings. We find that, on average, mass shootings have an economically significant negative effect on local labor markets. Our estimates suggest that mass shootings reduce earnings by about 2%. The effect persists for more than three years after the shootings. We show that earnings per employed worker decrease by 1.1%, suggesting that both intensive and extensive margins contribute to the effect of mass shootings on earnings. We then provide some evidence that mass shootings decrease employment by about 1%, although our employment results do not permit a linear violation of the parallel trends assumption. We find that the economic consequences of mass shootings are larger for services, manufacturing, and goods producing industries, and entirely driven by the private sector. We do not find an impact of mass shootings on establishments per capita._x000D_
_x000D_
We then investigate plausible channels, characterizing them into internal and external mechanisms. In the internal mechanism, we find that mass shootings are a negative shock to household wealth, expectations about current business conditions, and expectations for future personal finances‚Äîvariables that are directly responsible for household economic decision-making. Moreover, we find that mass shootings lead to poor mental health making the residents of targeted counties unable to engage in usual activities such as work, suggesting that shootings may decrease labor productivity or lead to an increase in absenteeism due to poor health. In the external mechanisms, we find that the national media coverage of mass shootings exacerbates the negative economic consequences for targeted areas. Greater national media coverage of mass shootings may make these places more salient in the nation and worsen their local impact._x000D_
_x000D_
Taken as a whole, our results show that mass shootings are major local labor market shocks. Our results show that mass shootings operate through internal mechanisms such as a decrease in household wealth, pessimistic expectations about the current and future state of the economy, and the deterioration of residents‚Äô mental health. These results suggest that public policy efforts in the aftermath of mass shootings should be aimed at managing expectations about future economic conditions so that individuals feel confident about the economy. Moreover, public policy efforts should aim to identify the groups most vulnerable to the negative mental health consequences of mass shootings and provide them with low-cost access to relevant medical treatment. Finally, national media outlets should avoid sensationalizing the coverage of mass shootings, which would help avoid making these areas less attractive to individuals and businesses located elsewhere._x000D_","In this paper, we investigate the economic consequences of mass shootings. We find that shootings have negative effects on targeted counties‚Äô economies. Estimates using three different comparison groups yield similar results. Examining the mechanisms, we find that residents of targeted areas: (i) develop pessimistic views of financial and local business conditions; and (ii) are more likely to report poor mental health, which hinders usual activities such as work, suggesting that shootings lead to decreases in productivity. Further, we find that greater national media coverage of shootings exacerbates their local economic consequences.","2",0,"2","Political",4,0

American law and economics review, 14(2), 457-487.","The aim of this paper is to investigate whether decisions on sexual activity are in part driven by considerations of costs and benefits. To test this hypothesis, our empirical approach relates abortion laws of different restrictiveness to reported gonorrhea incidence which is our proxy for risky sexual behavior. In our econometric analysis, we use data from 41 countries for the 1980‚Äì2000 period, as well as a more focused analysis of the nine countries that change their abortion laws during the sample period.

Consistent with our theoretical prediction and consistent with the results of Klick and Stratmann (2003, 2008), we find that compared with legislation that only permits abortion to save the woman‚Äôs life or her physical health, less restrictive abortion policies lead to significantly higher reported gonorrhea incidence. Our results are robust against a set of alternative model specifications that include the use of different weighing schemes and subsamples. Results for non-sexually transmitted diseases suggest that our findings are likely not driven by omitted variable bias arising from factors that make diagnosis more likely.

A concern remains that the countries whose legal variation we examine are idiosyncratic in ways that make one suspicious of drawing causal inferences from these results. Namely, Portugal and Spain both have relatively poor reporting systems for gonorrhea, missing a majority of cases. For Albania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, and Romania, concerns that the mechanism generating the change are related to the political changes these countries experienced around the time of abortion law changes (as opposed to the laws themselves having an effect on behavior) are impossible to rule out.

However, despite these concerns, the basic result that increased abortion access is associated with an increase in risky sex has now been demonstrated in three separate samples covering different periods, countries, and types of laws. Our results suggest that human disease spread models might be improved by including a behavioral component to generate more reliable results. Further, the finding that more liberal abortion laws are associated with an increase in risky sex may help practitioners to quantify and safeguard against possible public health repercussions of abortion liberalization.","Economic theory predicts that abortion laws affect sexual behavior since they change the marginal cost of having risky sex. We estimate the impact of abortion laws on sexual behavior by reported gonorrhea incidence. Our data panel includes 41 countries for which consistent gonorrhea data are available for 1980‚Äì2000. Compared with laws permitting abortion only to save the pregnant woman‚Äôs life or her physical health, the switch to more liberal abortion laws is associated with large increases in reported gonorrhea incidence. Our results help explain why birth rates do not decline at the same rate abortions increase when laws are liberalized.","5",0,"5","Political",4,0
57,10,"Wu, S. (2018). The effects of cueing and framing on youth attitudes towards gun control and gun rights. Social Sciences, 7(2), 29.","In this paper, I have conducted an analysis of youth attitudes towards guns and gun and school violence using a new data set of American High School seniors, juniors, and sophomores. Female students are less likely to believe that arming school staff would make schools safer and are generally less supportive of gun rights, consistent with prior literature (Smith 1984; Payne and Riedel 2002). Black teenagers do not have significantly different views on guns and gun rights than White teenagers, though I do find that Hispanics and other non-Whites are somewhat less supportive of gun rights than Whites. I do not find variation in attitudes according to family income. A consistent result in this study is that attitudes are strongly related to self-identified political preferences, a finding strongly supported by other research (Cox and Piacenza 2015; Parker et al. 2017). Students that most closely identify as Republicans are more likely to agree that arming citizens and arming school personnel would be effective in decreasing mass shootings and school violence than Democrats. Meanwhile, self-identifying Democrats are more likely than Republicans to believe that gun control laws should be stricter in many states. However, individual responses are also significantly shaped by the framing of the survey questions and the prompting of certain relevant information. The nature of cues and the political party identification determine the impacts that they have on student responses. Prompting students to think about prior acts of school violence increase the likelihood that Republicans agree about the efficacy of arming citizens to reduce violence, and to a lesser to degree for Independents, but this effect is not present for Democrats. Likewise, prompting students to think about the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution increases their assessment of the importance of individual gun rights for Republicans, but not for Democrats or Independents. When looking at the effect of informational cues, I find that providing selective information that certain states have loose gun control laws and low rates of gun violence increases the agreement that gun control laws are too strict in most states for Democrats and Independents, but not for Republicans. However, the prompting of information that certain states have loose gun control laws and high rates of gun violence actually decreases the likelihood that Republicans think that gun control laws are too strict, but has no impact for Democrats._x000D_
_x000D_
The results in this paper are consistent with the idea that emotional cues strengthen pre-existing biases towards gun control and gun rights, while informational cues sway people to become more moderate in their views on these issues. Of course, some caveats are important to mention. First, this survey was administered to high school participants, and the views of youth may be much more malleable than the views of the general population and an important question is whether the impact of cues and frames on survey responses of youth will actually lead to changes in adult behaviors such as voting. Granberg and Holmberg (1990) show that the correlation between intention to vote and actual voting is very high among U.S. and Swedish voters, though Hooghe and Wilkenfeld (2008) find more mixed evidence on the stability of attitudes and behavior over time. In addition, the results with respect to cues and framing of survey questions has been shown for one particular topic: school violence and gun rights/control. Whether or not these results would generalize to other age groups and for other public policy issues remains an open question. Nonetheless, in the current environment of polemicized and divisive discourse, there are potentially important implications of these results for the shaping of public opinions and debates between people of different political persuasions. Specifically, this results of this study show that providing objective information can be more helpful in narrowing the gaps in public opinions across political parties than appealing to one‚Äôs emotions about pre-existing biases. In addition, policy makers must be critically aware of the effects that the framing of questions and the prompting of various types of information may have on the way people respond to surveys, particularly younger individuals that may still be in the process of formulating their beliefs on important policy issues. These effects may also interact with the effects of race, gender, and family income. Further research that explores these issues would be helpful in understanding the factors that shape voter attitudes._x000D_","I analyze attitudes towards gun control from a recent survey of American high school students. For students who most closely identify as Republicans, cueing them to think about prior school shootings increases their agreement that armed staff in schools will improve safety and arming citizens will reduce risk of mass shootings.

For Republicans, providing selective information that certain states have loose gun control laws and high rates of gun violence makes them less supportive of gun rights.

Selecting the most effective nudge: Evidence from a large-scale experiment on immunization (No. w28726). National Bureau of Economic Research.","Despite immunization being one of the most effective and cost-effective methods to prevent disease, disability, and mortality, millions of children each year go unvaccinated. The COVID-19 epidemic has made the situation worse: vaccine coverage has dipped to levels not seen since the 1990s (Bill and Melinda Gates, 2020). Swift policy action is critical to ensure that this dip is temporary and children who missed immunizations during the pandemic get covered soon. _x000D_
_x000D_
In rural India, there was a priori reason to believe that nudges may work. After all, many children get their first vaccines but caregivers rarely follow through. This is consistent with the vast majority of caregivers reporting that vaccines are helpful. Yet, it was a priori unclear as to which nudge, let alone which policy bundle out of the 75 candidates, would be effective. _x000D_
_x000D_
Respecting this genuine uncertainty was critical. If we had simply done parallel treatments of incentives, reminders, and ambassadors, we might have found no effects. Our key finding is that combined interventions work better than each in isolation. Although there is temptation of paring down the number of treatments a priori for the sake of power, there is a danger in not doing this in a data-driven way. The suggestion of avoiding all interactions in this setting (made in Muralidharan et al. (2019)) would have led to the conclusion that nothing is effective. _x000D_
_x000D_
Additionally, the interaction effects identified by TVA teach us something about the world. From the point of view of public health policy it tells us that it is valuable to add networkbased insights (information hubs), which are not in a typical policymaker‚Äôs toolkit, to catalyze the effects of conventional instruments. From a basic research perspective, it also suggests that the information hubs, i.e. the person best placed in a village to circulate information, may be more effective when they have something concrete to talk about, such as incentives or something to explain such as SMSs. Such questions merit future research. _x000D_
_x000D_
The method suggested here is applicable to many domains where policymakers have several arms with multiple potential doses, do not have the time or capacity to adaptively experiment, or have genuine uncertainty about which policy bundles should be effective. Rather than guessing, or pretending to be an oracle, we suggest that policymakers consider the data-driven approach of treatment variant aggregation which may apply to their setting. The proposed method relies on strong assumptions that rule out some of the cases where model-selection leads to invalid inferences. Provided these assumptions are palatable, our findings show that TVA prunes and pools effectively and, thispays dividends when the policymaker wishes to adjust for the winner‚Äôs curse without falling into the trap of overconservatism. The algorithm can be easily pre-specified and does not require the researcher to take a stance on the possible effects of myriad interactions which are likely difficult to predict in advance._x000D_","Policymakers often choose a policy bundle that is a combination of different interventions in different dosages. We develop a new technique -- treatment variant aggregation (TVA) -- to select a policy from a large factorial design. TVA pools together policy variants that are not meaningfully different and prunes those deemed ineffective. This allows us to restrict attention to aggregated policy variants, consistently estimate their effects on the outcome, and estimate the best policy effect adjusting for the winner's curse. We apply TVA to a large randomized controlled trial that tests interventions to stimulate demand for immunization in Haryana, India. The policies under consideration include reminders, incentives, and local ambassadors for community mobilization. Cross-randomizing these interventions, with different dosages or types of each intervention, yields 75 combinations. The policy with the largest impact (which combines incentives, ambassadors who are information hubs, and reminders) increases the number of immunizations by 44% relative to the status quo. The most cost-effective policy (information hubs, ambassadors, and SMS reminders but no incentives) increases the number of immunizations per dollar by 9.1% relative to status quo.","3",0,"3","Political",4,1

Three studies, along with a pilot study, demonstrated that people with lower (vs. higher) childhood SES were more susceptible to the sunk-cost fallacy. Further, this effect was driven by the differences in the degree to which lower and higher childhood SES individuals felt perceived wastefulness for withdrawing from the events. The first two studies provided initial evidence for the proposed effect. In a pilot study, we first found a pattern between childhood SES and the sunk-cost fallacy. Then, Study 1 showed that, compared to higher childhood SES individuals, those with lower childhood SES were more susceptible to the sunk-cost fallacy. Study 2 replicated this negative relationship between childhood SES and the sunk-cost fallacy using a different scenario but also tested for the proposed underlying mechanism. Study 2 revealed that the effect of childhood SES on the sunk-cost fallacy was mediated by perceived wastefulness. In particular, this effect occurred only when a prior monetary investment was involved. The effect disappeared when there was no monetary investment. Study 3 further demonstrated that the proposed effect was evident in actual behavior (please see Supporting Information: Web Appendix for the design structure of each study).

Prior research showed that the susceptibility to the sunk-cost fallacy was determined by one's age (Strough et al., 2008), personality (Fujino et al., 2016), culture (Keil et al., 2000), temporal horizons (Strough et al., 2014), needs for cognition (Yan & Otto, 2020), and coping orientations (Van Putten et al., 2010). Our research adds another important determinant to extant literature‚Äîchildhood SES. Building on the recent perspective that the sunk-cost fallacy reflects an individual's decision patterns developed and reinforced through the adaptive learning process over time (Wong & Kwong, 2018), the present research showed that individuals from less affluent childhood environments are more likely to fall into the sunk-cost fallacy compared with those from wealthy childhood._x000D_
_x000D_
Second, unlike prior work that examined how childhood environments influence decision-making among children and adolescents (Burdick et al., 2013; Lundberg et al., 2009), our research shows that one's early-life environments can have long-lasting influences on decision-making. Specifically, we identified the impact of childhood SES on the susceptibility to the sunk-cost fallacy in adulthood. Importantly, our findings indicate that an individual's childhood resource level is a stronger predictor of the sunk-cost fallacy than the Person's current wealth level. These findings contribute to the childhood SES literature (Amir et al., 2018; Griskevicius. Ackerman et al., 2013; Infurna et al., 2011) by uncovering another important decision domain (i.e., the sunk-cost fallacy) that is influenced by abundance/scarcity of resources in one's early life._x000D_
_x000D_
Our research offers several practical implications. First, our findings suggest an important implication for lower childhood SES consumers' financial decision-making. While experts often advise people to buy and hold stocks for longer terms than to buy and sell frequently, too much patience can backfire. One of the common mistakes by nonprofessional investors is holding a loser for too long, expecting to get even (Artzberger, 2022). Relatedly, investors often attempt to average down stocks by purchasing an additional share of the losing stock in the hope that it eventually rebounds. It is a high-risk strategy because the fall may not be temporary but is only the beginning of a greater decline. Our findings suggest that such a bias can do more damage to lower childhood SES investors because they would perceive greater wastefulness from cutting losses in a losing stock. Thus, it is crucial for policymakers to require stock firms and trading platforms to equip their customers with adequate education and information and to design web/application user interfaces to protect customers._x000D_
_x000D_
Additionally, it should be noted that not every situation involving a sunk cost would be disadvantageous to those with lower (vs. higher) childhood SES. On the bright side, those with lower childhood SES may persist longer in important domains. For instance, our findings suggest that college students who grew up in relatively poorer environments may be less likely to drop out during the semester because of their ‚Äúsunk‚Äù tuition. Thus, federal agencies or social services that provide financial education may encourage those with lower childhood SES to stick to this somewhat difficult and boring subject by reminding them of how much time and effort they have already invested in the program. Practitioners can apply our findings to any services that promote the well-being of individuals such as debt-repayment programs or employee wellness programs._x000D_
_x000D_
7.2. Limitations and future research_x000D_
The present research has some limitations. Even though we did not find a significant effect of the current SES on the sunk-cost fallacy, some may argue that an individual's current (vs. past) abundance in resources should affect the perceived wastefulness of sunk costs (i.e., wealth effect). Indeed, G√§chter et al. (2022) showed that (current) income and wealth levels are positively associated with loss aversion which should lead to the sunk-cost fallacy (R. Thaler, 1985). Bruine de Bruin et al. (2007) also found that those with low (current) SES are more vulnerable to the sunk cost fallacy. Although none of these studies measured childhood SES, their results seem to conflict with our findings. However, the sunk cost fallacy can be seen as not a simple decision but rather an individual's decision patterns developed and reinforced through the adaptive learning process over time (Wong & Kwong, 2018). This suggests that the sunk cost fallacy should be more strongly influenced by one's life strategy than momentary judgment, which is more consistent with our findings. Nevertheless, future studies can investigate the relationship between the two constructs. It will be also especially interesting to examine the behaviors of individuals who made a transition between two life stages (e.g., from lower childhood SES to higher current SES or vice versa)._x000D_
_x000D_
Next, although the present research successfully demonstrated the impact of childhood SES on the sunk-cost fallacy, we have only limited knowledge about its boundary condition. When will individuals with lower childhood SES exhibit a lower susceptibility and those with higher childhood SES exhibit a higher susceptibility to the sunk-cost fallacy? As the sunk-cost fallacy prevents optimal decision-making, understanding what kind of intervention strategies might help low childhood SES individuals reduce the fallacy is important for their welfare. Such knowledge will improve the applicability of the current findings._x000D_","The sunk-cost fallacy is a well-documented cognitive bias in the decision-making literature. Although the emerging literature on childhood socioeconomic status suggests that early-life environments shape individuals' decision strategies and have a long-lasting impact on their decisions, little is known about the impact of childhood socioeconomic status on the sunk-cost fallacy. Using two different scenarios and an actual choice task, we provide converging evidence that individuals who grew up in resource-scarce environments (those with lower childhood socioeconomic status) are reluctant to abandon inferior choices merely because they have already invested substantial resources in them, resulting in the sunk-cost fallacy. This fallacy occurs because individuals with lower childhood socioeconomic status tend to perceive the loss of their prior investments as more wasteful than those with higher childhood socioeconomic status.","3",0,"3","Political",3,0

Personality and Individual Differences, 97, 165-172.","Research on intellectual humility has increased significantly in recent years, resulting in detailed conceptualizations and promising new measures (e.g., Krumrei-Mancuso, E. J. and Rouse, S. V., 2016, Leary, M. R., et al., 2016, McElroy, S. E., et al., 2014; cf. Meagher et al., 2015). That research has focused almost exclusively on intellectual humility as a trait that reflects the degree to which people are generally willing to reconsider their views. Relatively little attention has been devoted to intellectual humility with respect to particular views, some of which may be open to further consideration whereas others are not. We proposed a conceptual model of the specific intellectual humility construct and demonstrated that it could be assessed with respect to a wide range of specific views using a brief, adaptable measure. The findings from our research using that measure provides new insights into the relations between characteristics of specific views and the degree to which they are held with humility. They also highlight the advantages of a conceptualization focused on specific views for research questions concerning attitudes, persuasion, and behavior related to specific issues and topics._x000D_
_x000D_
The degree to which people approach their specific views with humility appears to reflect, in part, their general tendency to be intellectually humble (i.e., general intellectual humility). However, a significant proportion of the reliable variance in specific intellectual humility cannot be attributed to the general tendency toward intellectual humility or arrogance. This finding has two important implications for understanding intellectual humility with respect to specific views._x000D_
_x000D_
First, although people may tend toward humility or arrogance with respect to their opinions, beliefs, and positions, those who typically are humble may nonetheless be unwilling to consider specific views that call into question their own views on certain topics or issues, whereas those who typically are intellectually arrogant may be willing to consider alternatives with respect to some of their views. Thus, measures of general intellectual humility tell us only how intellectually humble or arrogant people are overall but may say little about their stance toward any particular view. From this observation follows the second implication: The underpinnings of intellectual humility with respect to specific views may include individual differences besides general intellectual humility and, as specified by our model, characteristics of the views. For example, findings from Study 2 point to low dogmatism and high openness as contributors to intellectual humility with respect to specific views, and the results of Study 3 suggest that specific views that are moderate and not based on personal exploration or study are held with greater humility. Thus, specific intellectual humility can be attributed, in part, to general intellectual humility, related individual differences, and characteristics of the views themselves._x000D_
_x000D_
Our earlier work on general intellectual humility (Leary et al., submitted for publication) coupled with the present work on specific intellectual humility embeds the intellectual humility construct in a rich nomothetic network, establishing both its conceptual kin and its distinctiveness from an array of constructs referenced in work on opinions, beliefs, and positions. At the individual difference level, intellectual humility covaries with openness, dogmatism, need for cognition, and self-righteousness, but is empirically distinct from those constructs (Leary et al., submitted for publication). At the specific view level, intellectual humility is, to a small degree, a reflection of general intellectual humility and one or more of these related constructs, but as detailed in our conceptualization of the construct, also reflects characteristics of the person's specific view and the basis for it. In this regard, the construct complements the rich literature on qualitative aspects of attitudes such as their accessibility (Fazio & Williams, 1986) and function (Katz, 1960) that contribute to their influence on behavior. A fruitful direction for future research is the conceptual and empirical integration of these well-established features of attitudes with intellectual humility with reference to those attitudes._x000D_
_x000D_
On a more practical level, the studies provided strong support for the Specific Intellectual Humility Scale. The items capture the three primary elements of the conceptualization yet operationalize specific intellectual humility as a unidimensional construct. They are worded in such a way that the simple insertion of a word or phrase referring to any view produces a reliable and valid measure of intellectual humility with respect to that view. Comparisons of the psychometric properties of the measure across a wide range of domains, topics, and issues indicate that the psychometric properties of the scale do not differ as a function of the view for which it is used. Importantly, an abbreviated, three-item version of the scale performed well, allowing for the assessment of specific intellectual humility in research contexts requiring brief measures such as opinion polls and surveys._x000D_
_x000D_
Our initial uses of the new measure suggest intriguing possibilities for future research incorporating specific intellectual humility. For research focused specifically on the role of intellectual humility in reactions to challenges or threats to peoples' views (e.g., Hopkin et al., 2014), the measure allows for optimal hypothesis testing through matching the specificity of predictor and criterion variables. For research focused more generally on the origins, functions, and consequences of people's positions on consequential issues, the measure provides a means of accounting for a property of views not currently addressed by models of attitudes and opinions (e.g., Eagly & Chaiken, 1998)._x000D_
_x000D_
Perhaps most importantly, research on specific intellectual humility may suggest strategies for promoting civil and productive discussions of contentious issues. By understanding the dispositional, situational, and message-relevant influences on intellectual humility and arrogance, we might find ways to lead people to be less certain of their views and, thus, more open to a broad analysis of the causes of and solutions to social and personal problems._x000D_","Although significant progress has been made in the conceptualization and measurement of intellectual humility, little is known about intellectual humility with respect to specific opinions, beliefs, and positions. We offer a conceptualization of specific intellectual humility and present three studies that examine its key tenets. Study 1 developed the Specific Intellectual Humility Scale and showed that its psychometric properties are excellent and invariant across a range of specific views. Study 2 considered additional specific views, further establishing measurement invariance and providing evidence of convergent and discriminant validity. Study 3 broadened the range of specific views and revealed that intellectual humility with respect to a specific view is a complex function of dispositional intellectual humility, the extremity of the view, and the basis for the view. These findings demonstrate the value of investigating intellectual humility with respect to specific views and the usefulness of the Specific Intellectual Humility Scale.","Apolitical",1,"4","Political",4,1
61,11,"Steele, C. M., & Aronson, J. (1995). Stereotype threat and the intellectual test performance of African Americans. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 69(5), 797‚Äì811. https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.797","The existence of a negative stereotype about a group to which one belongs, we have argued, means that in situations where the stereotype is applicable, one is at risk of confirming it as a self-characterization, both to one's self and to others who know the stereotype. This is what is meant by stereotype threat. And when the stereotype involved demeans something as important as intellectual ability, this threat can be disruptive enough, we hypothesize, to impair intellectual performance. _x000D_
_x000D_
In support of this reasoning, the present experiments show that making African American participants vulnerable to judgment by negative stereotypes about their group's intellectual ability depressed their standardized test performance relative to White participants, while conditions designed to alleviate this threat, improved their performance, equating the two groups once their differences in SATs were controlled. Studies 1 and 2 produced this pattern by varying whether or not the test was represented as diagnostic of intellectual ability‚Äîa procedure that varied stereotype threat by varying the relevance of the stereotype about Blacks' ability to their performance. Study 3 provided direct evidence that this manipulation aroused stereotype threat in Black participants by showing that it activated the racial stereotype and stereotype-related self-doubts in their thinking, that it led them to distance themselves from African American stereotypes. Study 4 showed that merely recording their race‚Äîpresumably by making the stereotype salient‚Äîwas enough to impair Black participants' performance even when the test was not diagnostic of ability. Taken together these experiments show that stereotype threat‚Äîestablished by quite subtle instructional differences‚Äîcan impair the intellectual test performance of Black students, and that lifting it can dramatically improve that performance. _x000D_
_x000D_
Mediation: How Stereotype Threat Impairs Performance _x000D_
Study 3 offers clear evidence of what being stereotype threatened is like‚Äîas well as demonstrating that the mere prospect of a difficult, ability-diagnostic test was enough to do this to our sample of African American participants. But how precisely did this state of self-threat impair performance, through what mechanism or set of mechanisms did the impairment occur? _x000D_
_x000D_
There are a number of possibilities: distraction, narrowed attention, anxiety, self-consciousness, withdrawal of effort, overeffort, and so on (e.g., Baumeister, 1984). In fact, several such mechanisms may be involved simultaneously, or different mechanisms may be involved under different conditions. For example, if the test were long enough to solidly engender low performance expectations, then withdrawal of effort might play a bigger mediational role than, say, anxiety, which might be more important with a shorter test. Such complexities notwithstanding, our findings offer some insight into how the present effects were mediated. _x000D_
_x000D_
Our best assessment is that stereotype threat caused an inefficiency of processing much like that caused by other evaluative pressures. Stereotype-threatened participants spent more time doing fewer items more inaccurately‚Äîprobably as a result of alternating their attention between trying to answer the items and trying to assess the self-significance of their frustration. This form of debilitation‚Äîreduced speed and accuracy‚Äîhas been shown as a reaction to evaluation apprehension (e.g., Geen, 1985); test anxiety (e.g., Wine, 1971; Sarason, 1972); the presence of an audience (e.g., Bond, 1982); and competition (Baumeister, 1984). Several findings, by suggesting that stereotype-threatened participants were both motivated and inefficient, point in this direction. They reported expending as much effort as other participants. In those studies that included the requisite measures‚ÄîStudy 2 and the replication study reported with Study 4‚Äîthey actually spent more time per item. They did not guess more than non-stereotype-threatened participants, and, as Black participants did generally, they reported rereading the items more. Also, as noted, these participants were strong students, and almost certainly identified with the material on the test. They may even have been more anxious. Stereotype threat increased Black participants' anxiety in the replication study, although not significantly in Study 2. Together then, these findings suggest that stereotype threat led participants to try hard but with impaired efficiency. _x000D_
_x000D_
Still, we note that lower expectations may have also been involved, especially in real-life occurrences of stereotype threat. As performance falters under stereotype threat, and as the stereotype frames that faltering as a sign of a group-based inferiority, the individual's expectations about his or her ability and performance may drop‚Äîpresumably faster than they would if the stereotype were not there to credit the inability interpretation. And lower expectations, as the literature has long emphasized (e.g., Bandura, 1977, 1986; Carver, Blaney, & Scheier, 1979; Pyszczynski & Greenberg, 1983) can further undermine performance by undermining motivation and effort. It is precisely a process of stereotype threat fostering low expectations in a domain that we suggest leads eventually to disidentification with the domain. We assume that this process did not get very far in the present research because the tests were short, and because our participants, as highly identified students, were unlikely to give up on these tests‚Äîas their self-reports tell us. But we do assume that lower expectations can play a role in mediating stereotype threat effects. _x000D_
_x000D_
There is, however, strong evidence against one kind of expectancy mediation. This is the idea that lowered performance or selfefficacy expectations alone mediated the effects of stereotype threat. Conceivably, the stereotype threat treatments got Black participants to expect that they would perform poorly on the test‚Äîpresumably by getting them to accept the image of themselves inherent in the racial stereotype. The stereotype threat condition did activate participants' self-doubts. This lower expectation, then, outside of any experience these participants may have had with the test itself, and outside of any apprehension they may have had about self-confirming the stereotype, may have directly weakened their motivation and performance. Of course it would be important to show that stereotype threat effects are mediated in African American students by expectations implicit in the stereotype, expectations powerful enough to more or less automatically cause their underperformance. _x000D_
_x000D_
But there are several reasons to doubt this view. For one thing, it isn't clear that our stereotype threat manipulations led Black participants to accept lower expectations and then to follow them unrevisedly to lower performance. For example, they resisted the self-applicability of the stereotype. But most important, as noted, it is almost certain that any expectation formed prior to the test would be superseded by the participants' actual experience with the test items; rising with success and falling with frustration. In fact, another experiment in our lab offered direct evidence of this by showing that expectations manipulated before the test had no effect on performance. Its procedure followed, in all conditions, that of the standard diagnostic condition used in Studies 1 and 2‚Äîwith the exception that it directly manipulated efficacy and performance expectations before participants took the test. After being told that the test was ability diagnostic, and just before taking the test, the experimenter (an Asian woman) asked participants what their SAT scores were. After hearing the score, in the positive expectation condition, she commented that the participant should have little trouble with the test. In the negative expectation condition, this comment indicated that the participant would have trouble with the test, and nothing was said in a no-expectation condition. Both White and Black participants were run in all three expectation conditions. While the experiment replicated the standard effect of Whites outperforming Blacks under these stereotype threat conditions (participants' SATs were again used as a covariate) F( 1, 32) = 5.12, p < .03, this personalized expectation manipulation had no effect on the performance of either group. For Blacks, the means were 4.32, 6.38, and 6.55, for the positive, negative and no-expectations conditions, respectively, and for Whites, for the same conditions, they were 8.24, 9.25, and 11.23, respectively. Thus in an experiment that was sensitive enough to replicate the standard stereotype threat effect, expectations explicitly manipulated before the test had no effect on performance. They are unlikely, then, to have been the medium through which stereotype threat affected performance in this research. _x000D_
_x000D_
Finally, participants in all conditions of these experiments were given low performance expectations by telling them that they should expect to get few items correct due to the difficulty of the test. Importantly, this instruction did not depress the performance of participants in the non-stereotype-threat conditions. Thus it is not likely that a low performance expectation, implied by the stereotype, would have been powerful enough, by itself, to lower performance among these participants when a direct manipulation of the expectation could not._x000D_
_x000D_
The Emerging Picture of Stereotype Threat _x000D_
In the social psychological literature there are other constructs that address the experience of potential victims of stereotypes. For clarity's sake, we briefly compare the construct of stereotype threat to these. _x000D_
_x000D_
""Token "" Status and Cognitive Functioning Lord & Saenz (1985) have shown that token status in a group‚Äîthat is, being the token minority in a group that is otherwise homogeneous‚Äîcan cause deficits in cognitive functioning and memory, presumably as an outgrowth of the self-consciousness it causes. Although probably in the same family of effects as stereotype threat, token status would be expected to disrupt cognitive functioning even when the token individual is not targeted by a performance-relevant stereotype, as with, for example, a White man in a group of women solving math problems. Nor do stereotype threat effects require token status, as was shown in the present experiments. In real life, of course, these two processes may often co-occur, as for the Black in an otherwise non-Black classroom. They are nonetheless, distinct processes. _x000D_
_x000D_
Attributional Ambiguity _x000D_
Another important theory, and now extensive program of research by Crocker and Major (e.g., Crocker & Major, 1989; Crocker, Voelkl, Testa, & Major, 1991) examined how people contend with the self-evaluative implications of having a stigmatized identity. Both their theory and ours focus on the psychology of contending with social devaluation and differ most clearly in which aspect of this psychology they attend to. The work of Crocker and Major focused on the implications of this psychology for self-esteem maintenance (for example, the strategies available for protecting self-esteem against stigmatized status) and we have focused on its implications for intellectual performance. There is also a conceptual difference. Attributional ambiguity refers to the confusion a potential target of prejudice might have over whether or not he is being treated prejudicially. Stereotype threat, of course, refers to his apprehension over confirming, or eliciting the judgment that the stereotype is self-characteristic. Again, the two processes can cooccur‚Äîas for the woman who gets cut from the math team, for example‚Äîbut are distinct. _x000D_
_x000D_
The Earlier Research of the Katz Group _x000D_
We also note that stereotype threat may explain the earlier findings of Katz and his colleagues. They found in the 1960s that the intellectual performance of Black participants rose and fell with conditions that seemed to vary in stereotype threat‚Äî for example, whether the test was represented as a test of intelligence or as one of psychomotor skill. A stereotype threat interpretation of these findings was foiled, however, by the lack of White participant control groups. Thus, the finding that manipulations very similar to Katz's depressed Black participants' performance while not depressing White participants' performance makes stereotype threat a parsimonious account of all these findings. _x000D_
_x000D_
Test Difficulty and Racial Differences in Standardized Test Performance _x000D_
The test used in these experiments is quite difficult, as the low performance scores indicate. As we argued, it may have to be at least somewhat demanding for stereotype threat to be occasioned. But acknowledging this parameter raises a question: Does stereotype threat significantly undermine the performance of Black students on the SAT? And if it does, is it appropriate to use the SAT as the standard for equating Black and White participants on skill level within our experiments? The answer to the first question has to be that it depends on how much frustration is experienced on the SAT. If the student perceives that a significant portion of the test is within his or her competence, it may preempt or override stereotype threat by proving the stereotype inapplicable. When the student cannot gain this perception, however, the group stereotype becomes relevant as an explanation and may undermine performance. Thus we surmise that over the entire range of Black student test takers, stereotype threat causes a significant depression of scores. _x000D_
_x000D_
And, of course, this point holds more generally. An important implication of this research is that stereotype threat is an underappreciated source of classic deficits in standardized test performance (e.g., IQ) suffered by Blacks and other stereotype-threatened groups such as those of lower socioeconomic status and women in mathematics (Herrnstein, 1973; Jensen, 1969, 1980; Spencer & Steele, 1994). In addition to whatever environmental or genetic endowments a person brings to the testing situation, this research shows that this situation is not group-neutral‚Äînot even, quite possibly, when the tester and test content have been accommodated to the test-taker's background. The problem is that stereotypes afoot in the larger society establish a predicament in the testing situation‚Äîaside from test content‚Äîthat still has the power to undermine standardized test performance, and, we suspect, contribute powerfully to the pattern of group differences that have characterized these tests since their inception. _x000D_
_x000D_
But, for several reasons, we doubt that this possibility compromises the interpretation of the present findings. First, it is unlikely that stereotype threat had much differential effect on the SATs of our Black and White participants since both groups, as highly selected students, are not likely to have experienced very great frustration on these tests. Second, even if our Black participants' SATs were more depressed in this way, using such depressed scores as a covariate in the present analyses would only adjust Black performance more in the direction of reducing the Black-White difference in the stereotype threat conditions. Thus, while a self-threateningly difficult test is probably a necessary condition for stereotype threat, and while stereotype threat may commonly depress the standardized test performance of Black test takers, these facts are not likely to have compromised the present results. _x000D_
_x000D_
In conclusion, our focus in this research has been on how social context and group identity come together to mediate an important behavior. This approach is Lewinian; it is also hopeful. Compared to viewing the problem of Black underachievement as rooted in something about the group or its societal conditions, this analysis uncovers a social psychological predicament of race, rife in the standardized testing situation, that is amenable to change‚Äîas we hope our manipulations have illustrated._x000D_","Stereotype threat is being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group. Studies 1 and 2 varied the stereotype vulnerability of Black participants taking a difficult verbal test by varying whether or not their performance was ostensibly diagnostic of ability, and thus, whether or not they were at risk of fulfilling the racial stereotype about their intellectual ability. Reflecting the pressure of this vulnerability, Blacks underperformed in relation to Whites in the ability-diagnostic condition but not in the nondiagnostic condition (with Scholastic Aptitude Tests controlled). Study 3 validated that ability-diagnosticity cognitively activated the racial stereotype in these participants and motivated them not to conform to it, or to be judged by it. Study 4 showed that mere salience of the stereotype could impair Blacks' performance even when the test was not ability diagnostic. The role of stereotype vulnerability in the standardized test performance of ability-stigmatized groups is discussed.","1",0,"1","Political",2,0

Several authors have mounted widely cited arguments that the evidence for LWA‚Äôs existence is less than persuasive and that the search for LWA should be abandoned. In the service of clarifying LWA‚Äôs nature and structure, we used exploratory test construction (Loevinger, 1957; Tellegen & Waller, 2008; Westen & Rosenthal, 2003) to develop and preliminarily validate a multidimensional measure of LWA. Our results suggest that LWA both exists and predicts key psychological and behavioral outcomes, including participation in political violence. In the following sections, we unpack our results, compare differences and similarities across LWA and RWA, discuss the role of political ideology in LWA and RWA, highlight limitations of the present research, and outline several promising directions for future research. We conclude with a discussion of LWA‚Äôs implications for (a) general authoritarianism and (b) psychological science. _x000D_
_x000D_
The Structure, Correlates, and Nature of LWA_x000D_
Authoritarianism among rightists has generally been understood to involve two broad dimensions: RWA and SDO, which reflect authoritarian submission and dominance, respectively (Duckitt & Sibley, 2007). RWA describes support for coercive social control, obsequiousness to established authorities, and conformity to traditional norms, whereas SDO describes support for hierarchy and the dominance of powerful groups over weaker groups. Other scholars have conceptualized authoritarianism as intolerance of difference and/or need for social uniformity (e.g., Feldman & Stenner, 1997). At the outset of this investigation, we did not have reason to suspect that LWA would necessarily mirror these conceptualizations due to their being tailored to right-wing populations. At the same time, we expected that LWA would dovetail with some core elements of previous conceptualizations, and in so doing, provide conceptual clarity concerning the nature of authoritarianism writ large. _x000D_
_x000D_
Our results point to the fruitfulness of a tripartite conceptualization of LWA comprising three correlated dimensions‚Äîantihierarchical aggression, top-down censorship, and anticonventionalism‚Äîthat broadly and inexactly reflect authoritarian dominance (e.g., SDO), authoritarian submission (e.g., RWA), and morally absolutist and intolerant desires for coercive forms of social organization, respectively. Antihierarchical aggression reflects motivations to forcefully overthrow the established hierarchy and punish those in power, perhaps mirroring SDO‚Äôs definitional core. Moreover, antihierarchical aggression‚Äôs nomological network was extremely similar to SDO‚Äôs nomological network, especially in the personality domain (i.e., low agreeableness, low honesty-humility, low conscientiousness, and psychopathic disinhibition and meanness), further suggesting that both constructs reflect authoritarianism‚Äôs power- and dominance-related features (Altemeyer, 1998), even as they differ in their orientation toward the established social hierarchy (i.e., challenging vs. upholding). _x000D_
_x000D_
Similarly, top-down censorship reflects motivations to wield group authority (e.g., governmental limitations on speech) as a means of regulating characteristically right-wing beliefs and behaviors, mirroring RWA‚Äôs definitional core. Fittingly, top-down censorship‚Äôs nomological network was more similar to RWA‚Äôs nomological network (i.e., low openness, cognitive rigidity, political intolerance, and dangerous worldview) than it was SDO‚Äôs. Thus, despite their manifest ideological differences, top-down censorship and RWA may similarly reflect authoritarian submission. Nevertheless, the parallels between antihierarchical aggression and SDO and top-down censorship and RWA are far from perfect. In Sample 5, for instance, antihierarchical aggression demonstrated greater similarity to both RWA and SDO than did top-down censorship, raising the possibility that antihierarchical aggression is simply a more direct analogue of rightist forms of authoritarianism than is top-down censorship. _x000D_
_x000D_
Anticonventionalism, the final LWA dimension, reflects a moral absolutism concerning progressive values and concomitant dismissal of conservatives as inherently immoral, an intolerant desire for coercively imposing left-wing beliefs and values on others, and a need for social and ideological homogeneity in one‚Äôs environment. As such, anticonventionalism does not clearly map onto authoritarian dominance or submission yet still reflects openly authoritarian sentiments and can be subsumed by the LWA construct. Consistent with this interpretation, before controlling for ideology, anticonventionalism manifested a pattern of correlations with external criteria that was not consistent with SDO or RWA, notwithstanding anticonventionalism‚Äôs large positive relations with free-speech suppression, social vigilantism, and lethal partisanship. Nevertheless, anticonventionalism‚Äôs pattern of relations was more consistent with RWA and SDO after controlling for political ideology. Moreover, in exploratory interaction analyses, anticonventionalism often potentiated the relation between antihierarchical aggression or top-down censorship, on the one hand, and outcome variables, on the other, with large effect sizes.21 These findings raise the possibility of multiplicative relations among LWA dimensions, such that LWA Index total scores are more than the sum of their parts. _x000D_
_x000D_
Thus, recognizable analogs of authoritarian dominance and submission were present in the LWA Index, situating LWA in parallel to longstanding accounts of authoritarianism on the right. By the same token, our investigation also revealed substantive differences between LWA and rightist forms of authoritarianism‚Äîmost consistently found in the anticonventionalism factor‚Äîunderscoring the need for a more expansive conception of authoritarianism (see Duckitt, 2020). Exploring the similarities and differences between LWA and RWA/SDO may offer a great deal of conceptual clarity in this regard. _x000D_

LWA and RWA/SDO: Similarities and Differences_x000D_
By and large, LWA and RWA/SDO seem to reflect a shared constellation of traits that might be considered the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of authoritarianism. These traits include preference for social uniformity, prejudice toward different others, willingness to wield group authority to coerce behavior, cognitive rigidity, aggression and punitiveness toward perceived enemies, outsized concern for hierarchy, and moral absolutism. Nevertheless, several notable differences between LWA and RWA/SDO also emerged. These differences can be broadly characterized as personological (i.e., variables reflecting a stable pattern of affect, cognition, and desires/motives that manifest in behavior), ideological (i.e., beliefs, attitudes, worldviews), and both personological and ideological (e.g., partisan violence). _x000D_
_x000D_
On the personological front, the most pronounced differences between LWA and RWA were negative affect (larger for LWA), confirmatory thinking (larger for RWA), and unjustified belief certainty. (larger for RWA).22 Further, RWA was more strongly related to cognitive rigidity and low openness than was LWA (prior to controlling for political ideology). This finding is consistent with the possibility that cognitive rigidity is functionally related to social conservatism in WEIRD samples (Van Hiel et al., 2016). Personological differences for LWA and SDO included coldheartedness (positive for SDO, null for LWA) and need for closure (positive for LWA, negative for SDO). Moreover, although authoritarianism has long been understood to centrally involve dispositional needs for control, certainty, and reduction of threats (either to the social order or status threats; e.g., Adorno et al., 1950; Jost, 2017; Wilson, 1973), critics of this position have observed that neither RWA nor SDO is associated with neuroticism, a personality trait characterized by the perception that the world is a dangerous place, along with the tendency to experience intense negative emotions and a sense of uncontrollability in response to stress (Barlow et al., 2014; Feldman & Huddy, 2014). LWA, in contrast, consistently predicted neuroticism in our data. This finding preliminarily suggests that left-wing authoritarians may be more sensitive to certain facets of threat and uncertainty than are right-wing authoritarians. By and large, though, LWA and RWA/SDO demonstrated far more personological similarities than differences. For instance, after controlling for political ideology, personological point estimates for LWA and RWA were within r = .05 for psychopathic meanness, cognitive reflectivity, the Dogmatism Scale, conscientiousness, need for closure, disinhibition, and psychopathic boldness. For SDO, point estimates were within r = .05 for antagonism, the DOG Scale, openness, extraversion, disinhibition, and psychoticism._x000D_
_x000D_
On the ideological front, LWA‚Äôs and RWA‚Äôs most pronounced differences were belief in science (null for LWA and negative for RWA), SVSS Conformity (negative for LWA and positive for RWA), and SVSS Self-direction (both negative, larger for RWA). For SDO, ideological differences were state control preferences (positive for LWA, null for SDO), determinism beliefs (larger for LWA), belief in science (null for LWA, negative for SDO), and belief in a dangerous world (larger for LWA). Point estimates for LWA and RWA were within r = .05 for fatalistic determinism beliefs, belief in conspiracy theories, and belief in a dangerous world. For LWA and SDO, these similarities were belief in conspiracy theories, SVSS Power, and SVSS Conformity. _x000D_
_x000D_
We also assessed several variables that capture both personological and ideological features, such as affective polarization and political intolerance. LWA and RWA were most dissimilar for partisan schadenfreude (positive for LWA, null for RWA), political social media use (positive for LWA, null for RWA), willingness to ban opposing views (larger for LWA), partisan violence (larger for LWA), and moral disengagement (larger for LWA). For SDO, the most pronounced differences were political intolerance (larger for LWA), willingness to ban public expression of opposing views (larger for LWA), partisan schadenfreude (positive for LWA, null for RWA), and moral disengagement (larger for LWA). LWA‚Äôs seemingly superior performance in this domain can likely be explained, at least in part, by the partisan skew of our samples (i.e., there were more leftists than rightists). If our samples had included more rightists than leftists, RWA and SDO would likely have been better predictors than LWA prior to controlling for ideology. _x000D_
_x000D_
What is more, political violence, a key component of folk and historical theories of authoritarianism (Wintrobe, 2006), is well-represented in the LWA Index and RWA Scale. Political violence can be directed either against the system (e.g., violent protests, terrorism) or to support the system (e.g., police brutality, support for war, state sanctioned torture of prisoners). LWA emphasizes antistate violence, whereas RWA/SDO emphasize prostate violence (Webber et al., 2020). Consistent with this possibility, LWA uniquely predicted participation in use of force for a political cause within the last five years, as well as support for, and participation in, antistate violence during the summer of 2020. The fact that antistate political violence has heretofore been largely excluded from the authoritarianism construct exemplifies the shortcomings of an exclusively right-wing account of authoritarianism. _x000D_
_x000D_
Authoritarianism and Political Ideology_x000D_
Having raised the possibility that a shared psychological core underlies different manifestations of authoritarianism, it is important to note that what authoritarianism fundamentally is, in psychological terms, remains a matter of ongoing debate (see Duckitt, 2020). Indeed, the chimerical construct has variously been conceptualized as a personality trait or disposition (e.g., Ludeke & Krueger, 2013), a rigid and absolutist style of thinking (e.g., Rokeach, 1960), an ideological attitude that satisfies discrete cognitive-motivational goals (e.g., Duckitt, 2001), and an index of political conservatism driven by needs to reduce and manage threat and uncertainty (e.g., Jost et al., 2003). These (at times) radically different conceptualizations complicate attempts to understand and discriminate between authoritarianism‚Äôs antecedents, authoritarianism‚Äôs consequents, and authoritarianism itself. Given these complexities, understanding the role that political ideology plays in measuring and conceptualizing authoritarianism represents an important avenue for future work. _x000D_
_x000D_
To understand whether and how authoritarianism and political ideology are related to one another, it should be acknowledged that various definitions of ideology have been advanced in the literature, and these are even more divergent and contradictory than those of authoritarianism (e.g., Gerring, 1997).23 Nevertheless, when psychologists have investigated political ideology, they have typically sought to understand why people are drawn to specific ideological beliefs (e.g., free-market capitalism), emphasizing the content of ideological claims (Zmigrod et al., 2020). Yet how someone holds their beliefs may be of equal or greater psychological relevance to authoritarianism than specific ideological content (Rokeach, 1960, pp. 14‚Äì15). Far-left and far-right ideologies (e.g., communism and fascism) are similarly authoritarian in their structure‚Äîboth exert powerful pressures to maintain discipline among members, advocate aggressive and censorious means of stifling opposition, believe in top-down, absolutist leadership, and so on. The content of communism, however, is arguably humanitarian and antiauthoritarian (e.g., the ideological aim is to remove economic inequities and take care of individuals per the doctrine, ‚Äúfrom each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs‚Äù). In contrast, the content of fascism is wholly authoritarian. If this is so, individuals may initially be drawn to far-left and far-right authoritarianism for different reasons (e.g., with the hopes of eliminating injustices vs. exacerbating them), even if they ultimately act in similarly authoritarian manners (Rokeach, 1960; see also Conway et al., 2020). _x000D_
_x000D_
Following this point, if authoritarianism is, indeed, a personality trait or disposition, it remains plausible that authoritarianism can be measured in a ‚ÄúPlatonic‚Äù form independent of one‚Äôs ideology. Hence, future research should attempt to tease apart LWA and RWA‚Äôs structure and content. Nevertheless, if authoritarianism is fundamentally or partially motivational, as others have argued, then measures of authoritarianism that are ideologically neutral may be of limited utility and/or not yield a coherent score. Moreover, even if LWA and RWA share many or most of their psychological substrates, left-wing ideology and right-wing ideology may interact with authoritarianism in different ways, rendering LWA and RWA both (a) more than the sum of their parts and (b) relatively unique ‚Äúflavors‚Äù of authoritarianism. Were this the case, attempting to measure authoritarianism in an ideologically neutral manner would obscure not only the unique contours of LWA and RWA but also their areas of substantive overlap. _x000D_
_x000D_
Until these competing possibilities can be resolved, it is necessary to measure and conceptualize LWA and RWA separately. For this reason, we chose to retain items in the LWA Index with leftwing content (but which were not highly correlated with ideology). In so doing, we ensured that our instrument measures authoritarianism in service of fundamentally left-wing motives and outcomes, thereby preserving future researchers‚Äô ability to compare and contrast LWA and RWA. Still, we were also quite careful to avoid creating a measure of left-wing ideology. Factors 1 and 3 of the LWA Index (as well as the measure‚Äôs total score) were consistently correlated, .45 with left-wing ideology and accounted for variance over and above ideology across dozens of criterion-related outcomes. LWA Factor 2, Anticonventionalism, tended to manifest larger correlations with ideology, but also accounted for variance in numerous criterion-related outcomes following statistical control for political ideology.24 The magnitude of these correlations is comparable with those commonly found among complementary but conceptually and empirically distinct pairs of psychological constructs, such as self-esteem and narcissism (Orth et al., 2016), shame and guilt (Paulhus et al., 2004), and affective empathy and cognitive empathy (Murphy et al., 2020). Moreover, the ACT Scale (i.e., an RWA measure with little explicit left vs. right political content; Duckitt et al., 2010) manifests correlations with political conservatism of a similar or larger magnitude than does the LWA Index (e.g., rs .60; Dunwoody & Plane, 2019). Thus, despite the presence of political content in some LWA items, the LWA Index successfully discriminates between political ideology and authoritarianism. _x000D_
_x000D_
Limitations and Future Directions_x000D_
To our knowledge, the present studies represent the most comprehensive investigation of LWA to-date. Nevertheless, we wish to delineate what can and cannot be concluded from our results. For instance, our results cannot directly speak to whether and to what extent the political right is more authoritarian than the political left, or vice versa, in part because it is unlikely that scores on the LWA Index and RWA Scale can be used and interpreted interchangeably in left- and right-wing samples. IRT scaling/ equating procedures may be useful in addressing this problem (i.e., by placing IRT parameter estimates from different test forms and populations on a common scale; Lee & Lee, 2018), although whether LWA and RWA can be distilled into a unidimensional, value-neutral authoritarianism construct remains an open empirical question. _x000D_
_x000D_
Further, the LWA Index comprises many more positively keyed items than it does negatively keyed items. This was done intentionally, because reverse-coded items frequently produce an artifactual ‚Äúkeying factor‚Äù that obscures the dimensionality of a latent construct (e.g., Netemeyer et al., 2003). Nevertheless, our nomological network analyses involving measures that also favor positivelykeyed items, such as the Personality Inventory for DSM‚Äì5 (Krueger et al., 2012), may have been distorted at least in part by shared method variance (e.g., owing to respondents who tend to respond positively to positively-keyed items, regardless of item content). Developing a relatively balanced pool of protrait and con-trait LWA items would be a worthy aim for future research. Granting this limitation, the LWA Index displayed dramatically different relations with a range of external criteria, including behavioral aggression, suggesting at least some substantive variance rising above method-covariance. _x000D_
_x000D_
An additional limitation concerns ‚Äújingle-jangle‚Äù fallacies (Block, 1995). Jingle fallacies entail the erroneous assumption that two measures with the same or similar names (e.g., Rokeach‚Äôs Dogmatism Scale and Altemeyer‚Äôs DOG Scale) reflect the same construct. In contrast, jangle fallacies entail the erroneous assumption that two measures with different names reflect different constructs. It could be argued that ‚Äúauthoritarianism‚Äù may not be an appropriate term for describing the shared core of LWA and RWA/SDO, at least insofar as authoritarianism is understood to entail deference to established authority (but see Conway et al., 2020). Future research could evaluate the psychological appropriateness of the term authoritarianism by using a version of Meehl et al.‚Äôs (1971) recaptured item technique, whereby one group of raters independently generates candidate factor names, based on a subset of items, and then a second group of raters attempts to ‚Äúrecapture‚Äù items by assigning them to their appropriate factor name, using a second subset of items. Combining measures of LWA, RWA, and SDO into a single item pool and drawing on this approach may be especially informative. Relatedly, recent evidence suggests that both left- and right-wing individuals report knowing many left-wing authoritarians (as well as right-wing authoritarians) in their everyday lives (Conway et al., 2020). Similarly, future work drawing on lexical approaches, which have been extensively used to clarify the structure and nature of personality traits and have even been adapted to the study of values (e.g., De Raad et al., 2016), may be a useful means of better understanding authoritarianism. _x000D_
_x000D_
Nevertheless, describing LWA and RWA using the same terminology without also clearly addressing the core ways they differ arguably risks blurring potentially important distinctions between them. As we have noted, communism and socialism, unlike fascism, propose humanitarian, egalitarian solutions to social injustices, which may attract individuals who hope to alleviate these injustices (Rokeach, 1960). Accordingly, left-wing authoritarians may come to believe that authoritarianism is ‚Äúa necessary evil‚Äù rather than an end unto itself. Some individuals who score highly on the LWA Index may be well-intentioned idealists seeking to build a better and a more equitable society by tearing down the establishment. Thus, any psychological similarities across LWA and RWA notwithstanding, we endorse no claims of motivational or moral equivalence (or a lack thereof) across the two constructs at present. _x000D_
_x000D_
Left-wing authoritarian ideologies may also appeal to individuals with greater cognitive complexity, because endorsing both authoritarianism and egalitarianism arguably involves reconciling two (seemingly) mutually contradictory beliefs. Indeed, embrace of contradiction is a key element of Marxist dialects (i.e., the ideological foundation of the Soviet Union and other left-wing authoritarian regimes; Hanson, 1997). Future research designed to find and clarify any differences between LWA and RWA is sorely needed to provide a more well-rounded view of the two constructs. _x000D_
_x000D_
Toward a More Comprehensive Science of Authoritarianism _x000D_
We have argued that a movement away from the conceptualization and measurement of exclusively rightist forms of authoritarianism may be required to crystalize authoritarianism‚Äôs definitional core. Having documented LWA, we now outline several additional new directions for future research in service of advancing the science of authoritarianism. _x000D_
_x000D_
One natural next step may be to construct a measure and conceptualization of authoritarianism that reflect the general properties held in common by left- and right-wing authoritarianism, drawing from the psychological commonalities revealed in the present investigation. Any such conceptualization would, in theory, apply to all positions on the ideological spectrum. Although past attempts to capture general authoritarianism have not succeeded (e.g., Rokeach, 1960), modern methods of scale development, such as those used in the present studies, may be cause for optimism. Further, the LWA Index and RWA Scale offer clear benchmarks for criterion-related validity that were not available to previous researchers. Success in this domain would offer enormous theoretical and practical advantages. For instance, a general measure could be fruitfully applied to new or yet-unstudied forms of authoritarianism, including authoritarianism in nations with politics that aren‚Äôt easily classified along the traditional left-right spectrum or authoritarianism in nonpolitical domains. _x000D_
_x000D_
Another natural progression of the present research involves exploring questions that might be more easily addressed by measuring authoritarianism in both leftist and rightist individuals. One such question concerns authoritarianism‚Äôs psychological and environmental antecedents. If the causes of RWA and LWA are highly similar, such a finding would support the hypothesis that a ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù authoritarianism underlies both constructs. In contrast, if LWA and RWA appear to stem from separate processes, such a finding would indicate that they are analogous but distinct phenomena, akin to organisms of separate species that develop functionally similar features via convergent evolution. _x000D_
_x000D_
Despite LWA‚Äôs and RWA‚Äôs marked similarities, it remains to be seen whether left-wing authoritarians who successfully overthrow the establishment tend to turn around and defend the new status-quo, thereby mirroring the right-wing authoritarians who came before them.25 Individuals high in LWA may instead tend to push back against any current power structure, even those born of revolutionary action, in which case there may be important psychological differences between LWA and RWA. Longitudinal research would be informative in this respect as it might hold the potential to arbitrate between these competing possibilities. _x000D_
_x000D_
Further, given that a third of the global population live in nations with autocratic or authoritarian governments (Repucci, 2020), yet another avenue for future research concerns exploring the diversity and complexity of the authoritarian phenomenon, which straddles sociopolitics, culture, and personality psychology, in non-WEIRD cultures, and especially in nations with authoritarian governments. Clarifying the psychology of authoritarianism among individuals who have first-hand knowledge of such systems of government, using measures explicitly tailored to their circumstances, would better allow researchers to triangulate the general properties held in common by all forms of authoritarianism. Even if LWA and RWA cannot ultimately be distilled into ‚Äúgeneral authoritarianism,‚Äù creating nuanced psychological portraits of individuals who exhibit authoritarian traits in diverse ideological and cultural contexts should provide substantial heuristic and functional value to the scientific research community and to public knowledge. _x000D_
_x000D_
Conclusions _x000D_
The dominant view of RWA as the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù of authoritarianism writ large is not merely an influential theoretical framework or a historical quirk‚Äîit limits the questions we ask as scientists, the methods we employ to answer those questions, and the types of theories we use to interpret our results. As such, the nearly universal exclusion of left-wing features from conceptualizations of authoritarianism, with little consideration of LWA‚Äôs and RWA‚Äôs psychological commonalities, has limited the kinds of knowledge we can produce as psychological scientists. Our intention in the present study has been to advance a new means of conceptualizing authoritarianism. Specifically, we have demonstrated the utility of conceptualizing and measuring leftist forms of authoritarianism, challenging longstanding portrayals of LWA as the ‚ÄúLoch Ness Monster‚Äù of political psychology. In light of authoritarianism‚Äôs enduring relevance to global politics and human behavior, we anticipate and hope that our work will allow researchers to better understand authoritarianism in all of its forms._x000D_","Authoritarianism has been the subject of scientific inquiry for nearly a century, yet the vast majority of authoritarianism research has focused on right-wing authoritarianism. In the present studies, we investigate the nature, structure, and nomological network of left-wing authoritarianism (LWA), a construct famously known as ‚Äúthe Loch Ness Monster‚Äù of political psychology. We iteratively construct a measure and data-driven conceptualization of LWA across six samples (N = 7,258) and conduct quantitative tests of LWA‚Äôs relations with more than 60 authoritarianism related variables. We find that LWA, right-wing authoritarianism, and social dominance orientation reflect a shared constellation of personality traits, cognitive features, beliefs, and motivational values that might be considered the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of authoritarianism. Relative to right-wing authoritarians, left-wing authoritarians were lower in dogmatism and cognitive rigidity, higher in negative emotionality, and expressed stronger support for a political system with substantial centralized state control. Our results also indicate that LWA powerfully predicts behavioral aggression and is strongly correlated with participation in political violence. We conclude that a movement away from exclusively right-wing conceptualizations of authoritarianism may be required to illuminate authoritarianism‚Äôs central features, conceptual breadth, and psychological appeal.","6",0,"6","Political",4,0

At least bias is bipartisan: A meta-analytic comparison of partisan bias in liberals and conservatives. Perspectives on Psychological Science, 14(2), 273-291.","The clearest finding from this meta-analysis was the robustness of partisan bias. A tendency for participants to find otherwise identical information more valid and compelling when it confirmed rather than challenged their political affinities was found across a wide range of studies using different kinds of samples, different operationalizations of political orientation and political congeniality, and across multiple political topics. The mean effect for overall partisan bias was modest in size, but statistically significant partisan-bias effects were found in 39 of 51 samples and in every subgroup compared in our moderator analyses. That is, the tendency to evaluate politically congenial information more charitably than politically uncongenial information was found whether the study manipulated congeniality via the source of the information or its content; whether political orientation was operationalized as ideology, party affiliation, or a specific attitude about a particular political issue; whether the sample was composed of students, adults opting into an online study, or a representative sample of U.S. citizens; whether the information evaluated was scientific or nonscientific; and across several different politically charged topics. None of this should be surprising given the extensive body of research confirming a pervasive human tendency toward motivated reasoning and self- and group enhancement (Brown & Kobayashi, 2002; Kunda, 1990; Mercier & Sperber, 2011; Sedikides, Gaertner, & Vevea, 2005; Stanovich, West, & Toplak, 2013). People are less skeptical consumers of information that they want to believe than of information that they do not want to believe (Ditto & Lopez, 1992), and this pattern is as evident in the political realm as it is in other realms of life that evoke strong emotions, preferences and social allegiances._x000D_
_x000D_
The question of ideological symmetry_x000D_
A corollary of the general robustness of partisan bias was specific support for the symmetry hypothesis. Our meta-analysis contributes to a long-standing and ongoing debate regarding the psychological similarities and differences between people occupying the left and right ends of the ideological spectrum (Adorno et al., 1950; Brandt et al., 2014; Crawford, 2017; Jost, 2017; Jost et al., 2003; Rokeach, 1956). Contrary to the view that political conservatives are particularly prone to defensiveness and cognitive rigidity (Adorno et al., 1950; Jost et al., 2003), our analysis found that when partisan bias was aggregated across studies, topics, and methodological details, both liberals and conservatives were biased in favor of information that confirmed their political beliefs, and the two groups were biased to very similar degrees._x000D_
_x000D_
Given the pervasiveness of motivated reasoning and the strong tribal animosities between left and right that have long characterized U.S. politics, it might seem odd to expect people on one side of the political divide to be substantially more or less evenhanded in their judgments than people on the other side. And yet there is a large and growing body of literature, including considerable experimental work, associating political conservatism with a broad array of motivational orientations suggestive of cognitive rigidity and resistance to negative or threatening information (Hibbing et al., 2014; Jost, 2017). This work is compelling, but it is important to note that these studies focus their comparisons on individual differences in general motivational proclivities (e.g., need for order, tolerance for ambiguity), whereas our meta-analysis examined specific judgmentoutcomes (e.g., the differential evaluation of politically congenial and politically uncongenial information). As such, the two sets of studies do not directly contradict each other, but the question clearly arises as to why the differential motivational tendencies of liberals and conservatives documented in past research were not found to manifest themselves in differential susceptibility to partisan bias in our meta-analysis._x000D_
_x000D_
One possibility is that the asymmetrical psychological propensities of liberals and conservatives have their primary impact not on susceptibility to bias in general but rather on the topics about which the two groups are likely to be biased (Brandt et al., 2014; Crawford, 2012, 2014). Greater commitment to attitude positions is associated with more selective processing and resistance to persuasion (Krosnick, 1988; Pomerantz, Chaiken, & Tordesillas, 1995; Zuwerink & Devine, 1996), and moral commitments may be particularly potent in rousing psychological defenses (Mullen & Skitka, 2006; Skitka, Bauman, & Sargis, 2005). By this account, conservatives‚Äô heightened discomfort with uncertainty and threat might reveal itself, not in more biased processing of information about any political topic, but rather in relatively pronounced bias about information that threatens or assuages those (or other) particularly conservative concerns. A recent study, for example, found political conservatism to be associated with greater credulity to information about personal or societal risks (e.g., attacks by terrorists or sharks) but not personal or societal benefits (e.g., the health advantages of carrots or cats; Fessler, Pisor, & Holbrook, 2017). Analogously, liberals by this account might be expected to show particularly biased responses to information bearing on their core concerns about protection for vulnerable groups and societal inequality. Uhlmann, Pizarro, Tannenbaum, and Ditto (2009), for example, found political conservatives to be unaffected by the race of an individual to be sacrificed in a moral dilemma, whereas liberals did discriminate on the basis of race: Liberals were significantly less likely to sacrifice an individual with a stereotypically African American name than a stereotypically White name (for similar findings, see Norton, Vandello, & Darley, 2004).6 Our meta-analysis found only nonsignificant differences in bias across political topics, but future research with greater statistical power and topics chosen to map onto the known psychological and moral sensitivities of liberals and conservatives (e.g., Graham et al., 2013; Jost et al., 2003) would be a more compelling test of the topic-specific bias hypothesis._x000D_
_x000D_
Another possibility is that the psychological differences between liberals and conservatives have their effects on aspects of the information processing sequence other than the biased evaluation of political information. The studies examined in our meta-analysis all confronted participants with information that either supported or challenged their political beliefs, a ‚Äústrong situation‚Äù (Mischel, 1977) likely to evoke motivated responding in most or all people, and one that precludes the choice generally available in the natural environment to direct one‚Äôs attention toward or away from particular kinds of information. It is possible, then, that the choice of what information to seek out or avoid is where conservatives‚Äô relative reticence toward novel and threatening information has its effects, rather than how that information is processed once it is confronted. Research in the selective-exposure tradition has produced several studies suggesting that the tendency to preferentially seek out information that supports rather than challenges political views is more pronounced in conservatives than in liberals (Barber√°, Jost, Nagler, Tucker, & Bonneau, 2015; Messing & Westwood, 2014; Nam, Jost, & Van Bavel, 2013; Rodriguez, Moskowitz, Salem, & Ditto, 2017). It is also true, however, that several studies have revealed no political differences in selective-exposure tendencies (Collins, Crawford, & Brandt, 2017; Frimer, Skitka, & Motyl, 2017; Iyengar & Hahn, 2009; Stroud, 2008), and a few have suggested greater selective exposure among liberals than among conservatives (Bakshy, Messing, & Adamic, 2015; Knobloch-Westerwick & Meng, 2009)._x000D_
_x000D_
Much like the pattern seen in our meta-analysis, the literature on selective exposure reveals considerable variability across studies in the relative magnitude of bias in liberals and conservatives; the clearest conclusion to be drawn from the extant data concerns the proneness of both sides to favor politically congenial over politically uncongenial information. Research on political selective exposure, however, is a step ahead of work on the biased processing of political information in its recognition of important boundary conditions and contextual influences on political bias such as information utility and attitude importance (Garrett & Stroud, 2014; Knobloch-Westerwick & Kleinman, 2012; Knobloch-Westerwick & Meng, 2009). Similar contextual factors have been found to moderate motivated-reasoning processes outside of the political domain (Kunda, 1990; Lerner & Tetlock, 1999; Neuberg & Fiske, 1987), and exploring their operation in political motivated reasoning has the potential to clarify predictions regarding when and in whom partisan bias is most likely to be found, including variability over time and political climate (Federico & Malka, 2018)._x000D_
_x000D_
Of course, further research is needed to thoroughly investigate all of the speculation above. This research would ideally include new experimental studies (e.g., comparing the magnitude of partisan bias across topics that differ in attitude importance or moral conviction for liberals and conservatives), longitudinal studies (where data are available) to track changes in political congeniality biases over time and historical context, as well as additional meta-analyses (e.g., comparing selective exposure tendencies in liberals and conservatives). The swelling body of research examining the psychological underpinnings of liberalism and conservatism should be particularly helpful in generating testable hypotheses._x000D_
_x000D_
There are almost certainly both important symmetries and important asymmetries between liberal and conservative psychology, and research exploring this complicated web of commonality is inaptly characterized as pursuing ‚ÄúSwiss-style neutrality‚Äù or some kind of false moral equivalency between liberal and conservative ideology (Jost, 2017). Different psychological processes contribute to different manifestations of bias, and there are complexities to political ideology that belie the simple unidimensional (liberal-conservative) characterization relied on here (e.g., Crawford, Jussim, Cain, & Cohen, 2013; Iyer, Koleva, Graham, Ditto, & Haidt, 2012; Malka & Soto, 2015). All this complexity must be considered in any comprehensive treatment of the ideological symmetry question, and given that complexity, a simple portrait of the psychological superiority of one ideology over another seems unlikely to emerge. Moreover, psychological comparisons are completely independent of, and in no way preclude, thoughtful assessments of the superiority or inferiority of political ideologies at a social, economic, or moral level. Psychological equivalency does not imply moral equivalency, despite a fundamental human tendency to conflate descriptive evaluations with prescriptive ones (Ditto & Liu, 2016; Hume, 1740/1985; Liu & Ditto, 2013). Political psychologists, ourselves included, face a unique challenge, highlighted ironically by the findings of pervasive partisan bias presented here, to prevent our own political views from influencing how we conduct and interpret our research. We agree with Jost (2017) that a preference for finding commonalities between ideologies is no less problematic than a preference for showing one particular ideology to be psychologically (or morally) superior to others, and we encourage all researchers interested in partisan bias to take every precaution to avoid falling prey to the very phenomenon we seek to understand._x000D_
_x000D_
Limitations_x000D_
Our meta-analysis was more targeted than some because of our desire to focus on studies that provide the most compelling evidence for partisan bias: experimental studies using a matched information design to examine differential evaluation of politically congenial and politically uncongenial information (Kahan, 2016). We could have cast our net more broadly to include studies using correlational data or other experimental designs or examining other kinds of partisan biases (e.g., selective exposure, hostile media bias). Instead, we felt that given the long-established difficulties of disentangling motivated bias from normative decision processes (Ditto, 2009; Kahan, 2016; Tetlock & Levi, 1982), focusing only on the highest quality studies as a first step would provide the most accurate and modest yardstick to compare bias across groups._x000D_
_x000D_
This does not mean, however, that bias is always the sole explanation for differences found in studies with carefully matched stimulus materials. For example, several studies included in our meta-analysis demonstrate significant differences in how positively an identical policy was evaluated, even when the only difference between conditions was a single word indicating whether one‚Äôs own party or the opposing party endorsed that policy (e.g., Malka & Lelkes, 2010). At one level this can be construed as bias: A person favors the very same policy that they would have rejected if the other party had proposed it. But party labels can also be thought of as cues, and favoring a policy supported by people one agrees with on many other issues can be thought of as a sensible heuristic strategy rather than a bias (Bullock, 2011; Leeper & Slothuus, 2014)._x000D_
_x000D_
This interpretational ambiguity, of course, is just one example of the formidable challenge of ruling out normative counterexplanation that transcends the study of bias in political judgment. In our meta-analysis, studies that manipulate the political content of information rather than its source are (arguably) less vulnerable to this ambiguity, and our analysis shows the mean effect of partisan bias to be equally strong in the former (r = .236) and in the latter (r = .251). But ultimately, there is an empirical catch-22 at the heart of all research on motivated reasoning. Because contextual information must be manipulated to produce differential motivations to accept or reject a given piece of target information, the informational differences between conditions that are a necessary part of the motivational manipulation are always a potential cause of any differential judgments between those same conditions. As long as information is used to manipulate motivation, the entanglement between the two (and the potential confounding that inevitably results) will always persist, at least to some degree._x000D_
_x000D_
Minimizing the plausibility of normative explanations for putative bias effects is important in scientific research, and restricting our meta-analysis to only the most carefully designed experiments was our attempt to do that here. But it is important to recognize that in the real world of politics, as in virtually every real-world situation, prior belief and motivated bias are naturally confounded (Ditto, Munro, Apanovich, Scepansky, & Lockhart, 2003), and both are likely to play a role in partisan resistance to politically challenging information. When confronted with the latest Republican tax-reform plan, for example, most Democrats approach that plan both expecting it to be bad policy (based on prior information to which they have been exposed about the ineffectiveness of tax cuts, almost certainly shaped by selective-exposure tendencies) and motivated to perceive it as bad policy, either because aspects of the policy offend their moral sensitivities or because of their general antipathy toward the Republicans who proposed it. This natural coalition of belief and motivation may help to explain why the bias we observe under tightly controlled experimental conditions seems so subtle compared with the seemingly blatant hypocrisy people often perceive in their real-world political antagonists._x000D_
_x000D_
Another key limitation of our study was our decision to treat political orientation dichotomously rather than continuously. This decision flowed primarily from our focus on matched information designs in which political congeniality was defined by whether information confirms or challenges participants‚Äô existing political views or allegiances, making the inclusion of individuals with moderate or politically independent views in continuous analyses problematic. Included studies also used varied operationalizations of left versus right ideology, many measuring or reporting it only dichotomously, so adopting a dichotomous approach allowed us to include the maximum number of studies in our analyses. Still, our approach of comparing the magnitude of liberal and conservative bias in reactions to information manipulated to either challenge or support partisan beliefs raises important issues about the equivalency of stimulus materials across experimental conditions (for examination of one such issue, see the Supplemental Material available online) as well as the extent to which our liberal and conservative samples were equally extreme in their ideological commitments. Future work should consider how to best gauge bias across the continuous spectrum of ideology, most critically for the ability to evaluate what is likely to be an important role for ideological extremity in fomenting partisan bias._x000D_
_x000D_
Finally, it is important to consider whether the political views of researchers may have influenced the sample of studies available for our meta-analysis, especially in a field so disproportionally composed of individuals whose sympathies lie with one particular political perspective (Inbar & Lammers, 2012). In most meta-analyses, the file-drawer problem is a straightforward matter of gauging the extent to which null results are underrepresented in the published data. The current case is more complicated in that (a) our primary result of interest is a null finding (no difference in magnitude of bias between liberals and conservatives) and (b) it is plausible to consider whether a particular pattern of affirmative results‚Äîthose showing strong liberal bias‚Äîmight be underrepresented in the literature as well._x000D_
_x000D_
First, we made active attempts to uncover and include data from unpublished sources and conducted moderator analyses comparing the relative effect size of conservative and liberal bias in published and unpublished studies, which revealed no significant differences. Second, suppression of evidence of liberal bias (either active or passive) seems unlikely in that very few of the studies included in our meta-analysis were specifically focused on comparing the magnitude of liberal and conservative bias; most did not even report the relevant data or comparisons. Still, we should note again that although we can find no evidence that the strength of liberal bias was underestimated in the current study, research on partisan bias is naturally fraught with the potential for that same partisan bias to influence the research process at multiple levels, from study design and construction of stimulus materials to the analysis and reporting of relevant data. New methods being promoted to enhance the reproducibility of empirical findings in the field of psychology (e.g., Cumming, 2014; Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn, 2011) should help combat all forms of research bias, including those flowing from researchers‚Äô political commitments (Ditto, Wojcik, Chen, Grady, & Ringel, 2015)._x000D_
_x000D_
Conclusion_x000D_
It is common in political discourse to hear politicians and pundits contrast the biased opinions of their political opponents with their own side‚Äôs impartial view of the facts. Our meta-analysis suggests instead that partisan bias is a bipartisan problem and that we may simply recognize bias in others better than we see it in ourselves (Pronin, 2007). This same myopia toward our own side‚Äôs biases may also help explain why a field dominated by liberal researchers has been so much more focused on the biased perceptions of the political right than the political left. This meta-analysis raised more questions than it answered in terms of the specific determinants of partisan bias, and future research may suggest that our assessment of the magnitude of bias in each side may be imprecise (see the confidence and prediction intervals in Table 2) or historically variable. What is most clear from the data, however, is that both liberals and conservatives show a consistent tendency to be less skeptical consumers of information that supports than challenges their political beliefs. The fact that neither side is immune to partisan bias may be the more important point than whether one side falls prey to it slightly more than the other._x000D_
_x000D_
Using different standards to evaluate information when it supports your political views than when it challenges them represents an obvious problem in terms of normative standards of judgment. Still, it can be argued that in terms of individual self-interest, a tendency to adjust one‚Äôs political views to fit with norms of important social or cultural groups makes good sense (Kahan, 2013). But partisan bias represents a practical problem as well. It is increasingly clear in contemporary U.S. politics that liberals and conservatives often hold dramatically different factual beliefs about key political issues (Frankovic, 2016; Rampell, 2016). The processing biases documented in our meta-analysis, particularly in conjunction with partisan selective-exposure effects, are likely to be an important contributor to these ‚Äúalternative facts‚Äù by leading political partisans to readily accept ‚Äúfacts‚Äù that support their side‚Äôs positions rather than to carefully scrutinize them. These differences in factual belief can in turn contribute to political conflict and governmental dysfunction by making compromise and negotiation more difficult and fueling corrosive political stereotypes of the other side as deluded, hypocritical, or just plain dumb (Ditto & Liu, 2016; Kennedy & Pronin, 2008)._x000D_
_x000D_
One solution many in the academy might suggest is the provision of clear scientific data to provide impartial answers to disputed questions of fact and to use as a foundation for evidence-based policy prescriptions. Our data, however, present a potential obstacle for this proposed solution in that our moderator analyses revealed that political partisans responded to information composed of scientific data in just as biased a fashion as they responded to nonscientific arguments. Rather than being the final arbiter of truth‚Äîthe impartial political referee that many people seem to crave‚Äîempirical data may simply provide ‚Äúgrist for a motivated cognitive mill‚Äù (Ditto & Lopez, 1992, p. 579). Together with a growing body of evidence suggesting that increased knowledge and expertise in a topic area exacerbates rather than ameliorates political bias (Kahan et al., 2012; Liu & Ditto, 2013; Taber & Lodge, 2006), the prognosis for eradicating partisan bias with harder data and better education does not seem particularly rosy.7_x000D_
_x000D_
Sophisticated strategies informed by psychological science need to be developed to combat our political prejudices (e.g., Feinberg & Willer, 2013; Fernbach, Rogers, Fox, & Sloman, 2013) and to begin to build a less polarized, more civil, and more evidence-based political culture. The evidence available right now, both scientific and anecdotal, suggests that this will not be easy. But a crucial first step is to recognize our collective vulnerability to perceiving the world in ways that validate our political affinities._x000D_","Both liberals and conservatives accuse their political opponents of partisan bias, but is there empirical evidence that one side of the political aisle is indeed more biased than the other? To address this question, we meta-analyzed the results of 51 experimental studies, involving over 18,000 participants, that examined one form of partisan bias‚Äîthe tendency to evaluate otherwise identical information more favorably when it supports one‚Äôs political beliefs or allegiances than when it challenges those beliefs or allegiances. Two hypotheses based on previous literature were tested: an asymmetry hypothesis (predicting greater partisan bias in conservatives than in liberals) and a symmetry hypothesis (predicting equal levels of partisan bias in liberals and conservatives). Mean overall partisan bias was robust (r = .245), and there was strong support for the symmetry hypothesis: Liberals (r = .235) and conservatives (r = .255) showed no difference in mean levels of bias across studies. Moderator analyses reveal this pattern to be consistent across a number of different methodological variations and political topics. Implications of the current findings for the ongoing ideological symmetry debate and the role of partisan bias in scientific discourse and political conflict are discussed.","4",0,"4","Political",4,1
64,11,"Napier, J. L., & Jost, J. T. (2008). Why are conservatives happier than liberals?. Psychological Science, 19(6), 565-572.","In three studies, using nationally representative samples from the United States and nine additional countries, we consistently found that conservatives (or right-wingers) are happier than liberals (or left-wingers). This ideological gap in happiness is not accounted for by demographic differences or by differences in cognitive style (as measured by the need for cognition in Study 1). We did find, however, that the rationalization of inequality‚Äîa core component of conservative ideology (Jost, Glaser, et al., 2003)‚Äîhelps to explain why conservatives are, on average, happier than liberals. These findings are consistent with system-justification theory, which posits that viewing the status quo (with its attendant degree of inequality) as fair and legitimate serves a palliative function (Jost & Hunyady, 2002). Study 3, in particular, suggests that conservatism provides an emotional buffer against the negative hedonic impact of inequality in society._x000D_
_x000D_
These findings contribute to the research literatures on the economic and psychological determinants of nation-level happiness. Our finding that worsening inequality is associated with decreased overall happiness levels is broadly consistent with previous findings that indicators of liberal development, including social capital, democratic governance, human rights, and peace, predict increased happiness at the national level (Diener & Seligman, 2004; Diener & Tov, 2007)._x000D_
_x000D_
However, our research suggests that inequality takes a greater psychological toll on liberals than on conservatives, apparently because liberals lack ideological rationalizations that would help them frame inequality in a positive (or at least neutral) light. This could explain, in part, why conservative governments tend to increase inequality more than liberal governments (Bartels, 2004). In addition, our work offers a theoretical framework that could help to explain why the negative relation between inequality and happiness is stronger in Europe than it is in the United States. Alesina et al. (2004) proposed that the American emphasis on meritocratic ideology renders economic inequality less aversive to Americans than to Europeans (see also Hartz, 1955). Our studies provide support for the notion that ideological differences can, in fact, explain certain effects of inequality on happiness._x000D_
_x000D_
There is no reason to think that the effects we have identified here are unique to economic forms of inequality. Research suggests that highly egalitarian women are less happy in their marriages compared with their more traditional counterparts (Wilcox & Nock, 2006), apparently because they are more troubled by disparities in domestic labor (Coltrane, 2000). System-justification theory provides a powerful means of analyzing and appreciating the palliative effects of rationalizing various forms of inequality in social relations, as well as the costs of failing to do so._x000D_","In this research, we drew on system-justification theory and the notion that conservative ideology serves a palliative function to explain why conservatives are happier than liberals. Specifically, in three studies using nationally representative data from the United States and nine additional countries, we found that right-wing (vs. left-wing) orientation is indeed associated with greater subjective well-being and that the relation between political orientation and subjective well-being is mediated by the rationalization of inequality. In our third study, we found that increasing economic inequality (as measured by the Gini index) from 1974 to 2004 has exacerbated the happiness gap between liberals and conservatives, apparently because conservatives (more than liberals) possess an ideological buffer against the negative hedonic effects of economic inequality.","1",1,"1","Political",3,0
65,11,"Zou, L., & Cheryan, S. (2015). When Whites' attempts to be multicultural backfire in intergroup interactions. Social and Personality Psychology Compass, 9(11), 581-592.","Although our primary focus in this paper has been the pitfalls of multiculturalism from the target's perspective, below, we briefly address how multiculturalism may backfire in intergroup interactions from the perpetrator's perspective as well.

Research has demonstrated that multiculturalism can improve Whites' behaviors in intergroup interactions (Vorauer et al., 2009); however, these benefits are not unconditional (Vorauer & Sasaki, 2010, 2011). Because multiculturalism encourages Whites to adopt an outward focus and engage more deeply with racial differences, this manner of engagement can ironically lead to negative interpersonal outcomes in situations wherein these differences are not agreeable (Sasaki & Vorauer, 2013). A multicultural prime caused Whites high in prejudice (but not those low in prejudice) to convey less warmth towards people of color in an intergroup interaction, and feel more disturbed by cultural differences (Vorauer & Sasaki, 2010). In another study, relative to Whites who were not primed with multiculturalism, Whites primed with multiculturalism reacted with greater hostility after learning that a person of color disagreed with or rejected them (Vorauer & Sasaki, 2011). Similarly, after reading an article proposing a new registration policy that would grant students of color early registration access at the expense of White students, White students primed with multiculturalism (versus colorblindness) expressed greater explicit racial bias (Correll, Park, & Smith, 2008). Thus, while multiculturalism may prompt positive behaviors from Whites in low-conflict situations, in situations where Whites perceive racial and ethnic differences to be threatening, multiculturalism may backfire to prompt hostility and negativity instead.

Whites are not the only ones who may go awry in their attempts to enact multiculturalism. Given the complex nature of intra-minority relations, people of color are capable of filling the role of perpetrator as well (Shapiro & Neuberg, 2008). For instance, non-Whites also express positive racial stereotypes about other groups (Bergsieker et al., 2012), and people of color can have their racial identity denied by members of their own in-group (Johnson & Ashburn-Nardo, 2014; Johnson & Kaiser, 2013). However, situations in which the potential perpetrator is another person of color, especially from one's own group, may be less automatically threatening (Brown, 1998; Wout, Shih, Jackson, & Sellers, 2009) compared to when the perpetrator belongs to the dominant group in power (i.e. Whites). As diversity ideologies impact not just Whites' behavior in intergroup interactions but the behavior of people of color as well (Vorauer et al., 2009), more research is needed to investigate the ways in which intra-minority attempts to be multicultural may manifest, and how such interactions play out.

Does Colorblindness Backfire Too?
Given the ways in which Whites' attempts to be attentive to group differences can backfire, it may be tempting to conclude that the solution is to ignore group differences instead. Indeed, colorblindness remains the more pervasive ideology in the United States (Apfelbaum, Norton, & Sommers, 2012) and can be used to promote racial equality and unbiased treatment (Plaut, 2010; Purdie-Vaughns, Steele, Davies, Ditlmann, & Crosby, 2008). However, significant criticisms have also been leveled against colorblindness (Markus, Steele, & Steele, 2002; Plaut, 2010), and a colorblind approach to intergroup interactions has its own set of pitfalls. Whites who practiced colorblindness and avoided mentioning race during a photo-matching task in which making racial classifications was appropriate exhibited less friendly non-verbal behavior and were perceived as less friendly by their Black interaction partners (Norton, Sommers, Apfelbaum, Pura, & Ariely, 2006). Compared to multiculturalism, priming Whites with colorblindness caused them to express more negative affect (Vorauer et al., 2009) and behave with more prejudice towards people of color, who experienced cognitive depletion following the interaction (Holoien & Shelton, 2012). Consequently, it does not seem any more preferable to always ignore racial and ethnic differences, especially in contexts where race is relevant (Apfelbaum et al., 2008) and significantly informs people's lived experiences (Markus, Steele, & Steele, 2000).

Taken together, the question becomes as follows: When is multiculturalism the better approach to intergroup interactions, and when is colorblindness defensible? The most advantageous strategy would be to educate people about the distinct benefits and limitations of both multiculturalism and colorblindness in different situations. Specifically, the effectiveness of either approach is contingent on the preferences and expectations of the people of color involved. In order to calibrate their behavior accordingly, Whites' should first be responsive to the interpersonal social cues that signal the appropriateness of one approach over the other. In interactions in which race is not central, people of color perceive Whites who bring up race to be more prejudiced than Whites who are more ‚Äúcolorblind‚Äù (Apfelbaum et al., 2008). Thus, when race is not salient and people of color have not indicated being interested in or open to talking about their race, it may be inappropriate for Whites to force the topic themselves. However, in interactions in which race is central and clearly relevant to the conversation, Whites who purposefully avoid race are perceived as more prejudiced (Apfelbaum et al., 2008). Thus, when people of color initiate a conversation about race and would rather their racial identities be acknowledged and heard, a response such as ‚ÄúI don't see you as a Black person‚Äù may be obtuse and insensitive.

Secondly, Whites should be aware of and educated about the broader diversity-related cues in the environment to which people of color are themselves often attuned. In a setting with high minority representation, a colorblind approach that emphasizes individual qualities may be appealing (Purdie-Vaughns & Walton, 2011; Purdie-Vaughns et al., 2008). However, settings with poor minority representation, and settings in which race has played and continues to play a critical role in individuals' life circumstances and experiences (e.g. educational settings), may be better served by an approach that does not devalue or ignore such racial differences (Markus, Steele, & Steele, 2002). Going forward, more research will be needed to identify which situations are better approached with multiculturalism, and which with colorblindness.

Doing Multiculturalism More Successfully
Being seen and understood by others as we see and understand ourselves is a common and shared desire (Swann & Read, 1981). Unfortunately, Whites' attempts to enact multicultural ideals in intergroup interactions can sometimes cause a harmful discrepancy between how people of color are seen, and how they see themselves and want to be seen by others. When poorly done, multiculturalism is prone to backfiring, as Whites' efforts to acknowledge, appreciate, and learn about racial and ethnic differences makes people of color's group identity uncomfortably salient (minority spotlight effect), makes people of color feel that attributes are being imposed onto their group identity (positive stereotyping), or makes people of color feel precluded from another group identity (identity denial). Thus, the when and how of ‚Äúdoing‚Äù multiculturalism are critical to its success.

As the United States' racial and ethnic diversity continues to grow at unprecedented rates, and individuals of varied backgrounds come into more frequent contact, it is necessary to improve upon our existing approaches to diversity. To the extent that people of color want their racial and ethnic identities to be recognized and celebrated, multiculturalism can have a beneficial impact on intergroup interactions. However, Whites should not let their own motivation to enact multicultural ideals take priority over how people of color themselves wish to be seen.","Whites' attempts to enact multicultural ideals in intergroup interactions can sometimes have negative interpersonal consequences. This paper reviews the instances when Whites' efforts to acknowledge, appreciate, and learn about racial and ethnic differences can make people of color's group identity uncomfortably salient (minority spotlight effect), make people of color feel that certain attributes are being imposed onto their group identity (positive stereotyping), or make people of color feel precluded from another group identity (identity denial). Each of these situations introduces a hurtful discrepancy between how people of color are seen by others and how they wish to be seen. Suggestions for how to ‚Äúdo‚Äù multiculturalism in ways that avoid creating this discrepancy are discussed.","1",0,"1","Political",2,0
66,11,"Stoet, G., & Geary, D. C. (2012). Can stereotype threat explain the gender gap in mathematics performance and achievement?. Review of General psychology, 16(1), 93-102.","We started our review with an overview of research on gender differences in mathematics performance and achievement. Based on the various large surveys on this topic, it seems reasonable to conclude that at least in the higher levels of performance, male mathematical achievers appear to outnumber female mathematical achievers. This is not only reflected in mathematics exams, but also in the number of jobs related to mathematics held by men and, for example, the prestigious Fields Medal for mathematical achievement, which has been won by men only since it was first awarded in 1936. While few researchers will deny that there are gender differences in mathematics achievement, the really interesting question is what factors contribute to these differences, especially given that it will be impossible to close the gender gap without understanding these factors._x000D_
_x000D_
This article reviewed evidence for the stereotype threat explanation of gender differences in performance, favoring boys and men, on difficult mathematics tests (gender differences are not typically found on comparatively easy tests; Penner, 2003). The question was whether the published research provides strong and stable evidence for the stereotype threat hypothesis as the primary causal explanation of this gender difference. Even when assuming that all failures to replicate have been reported, we can only conclude that evidence for the stereotype threat explanation of the gender difference in mathematics performance is weak at best, as less than half of the studies from which clear and unconfounded conclusions can be drawn did not show such an effect._x000D_
_x000D_
We also discussed the extent to which existing literature has amplified the stereotype threat hypothesis such that uncritical reading of the literature would lead one to conclude, as many have, that the hypothesis is strongly supported. Given the many enthusiastic statements about the stereotype threat effect, one of the most surprising findings of our review was that there were only 21 studies (including the original) that compared mathematics performance of men and women who were randomly assigned to threat conditions. This seems to be quite a contrast to larger reviews, such as by Nguyen and Ryan (2008). We identified three main reasons for the difference. First, their review was very general, whereas ours focused on the stereotype threat explanation of the gender gap in mathematics performance only. Thus, the many articles that were about other groups that might be affected by stereotype threat were not included. Second, we only included studies that had a male control group. Third, we only included published studies. We believe that this is reasonable, because it is difficult to determine the scientific credibility of unpublished data. Furthermore, we do not think that a possible file drawer effect, which is the likelihood of missing articles that have not been published, would change our conclusion. More likely than not, unpublished studies would have found no differences between experimental conditions, although we can only speculate about this._x000D_
_x000D_
We think that a more critical reading and interpretation of results is a necessity. After all, the aforementioned types of flaws in scientific work will ultimately damage the reputation of the whole field of psychology as a science, as was recently addressed in a New York Times article by Carey (2011) about forgery and unchallenged data massage:_x000D_
_x000D_
The scandal, involving about a decade of work, is the latest in a string of embarrassments in a field that critics and statisticians say badly needs to overhaul how it treats research results. In recent years, psychologists have reported a raft of findings on race biases, brain imaging and even ESP that have not stood up to scrutiny. Outright fraud may be rare, these experts say, but they contend that Dr. Stapel took advantage of a system that allows researchers to operate in near secrecy and massage data to find what they want to find, without much fear of being challenged._x000D_
_x000D_
‚ÄúThe big problem is that the culture is such that researchers spin their work in a way that tells a prettier story than what they really found,‚Äù said Jonathan Schooler, a psychologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. ‚ÄúIt's almost like everyone is on steroids, and to compete you have to take steroids as well.‚Äù (p. A3)_x000D_
_x000D_
We are hopeful that our review can help to counterbalance the mischaracterization of stereotype threat and the common belief that this threat has a strong causal effect on women's performance, which may influence policy making and popular beliefs in ways that, ironically, perpetuate the gender difference (Geary, 1996). When policymakers believe that achievement differences in mathematics can be overcome by simply reducing stereotypical beliefs (as the literature suggests), they might not be willing to invest in the study of other potential contributing factors and thus will not pursue solutions for these factors.8_x000D_
_x000D_
But what if other factors, such as the gender difference in three-dimensional spatial cognition or interest in nonsocial domains, contribute to the gap (Baron-Cohen, Knickmeyer, & Belmonte, 2005; Ceci & Williams, 2010; Ceci et al., 2009; Farrell, 2005; Ferriman, Lubinski, & Benbow, 2009; Geary, 1996; Lubinski, Benbow, & Sanders, 1993)? In this situation, the focus on stereotype threat will ensure that other potential contributing factors are ignored or downplayed and thus efforts will not be invested in better understanding them or interventions to change them. For example, instructing women on how to use spatial diagrams to setup complex multistep mathematical word problems (which many men do without instruction) can reduce women's disadvantage on these problems (Johnson, 1984). Downplaying the relation between spatial abilities and performance in some areas of mathematics and corresponding gender differences (e.g., Casey, Nuttall, & Benbow, 1995) ensures that interventions to address these differences will not be developed, and absence of such interventions ensures the gap will remain._x000D_
_x000D_
Finally, given the importance and influence of the stereotype threat hypothesis, it is essential that researchers conduct studies aimed to replicate the original findings, and more fully address the relative contribution of threat to the overall magnitude of the gender differences in mathematics performance. In general, researchers should be more precise in their characterization of previous research and more circumspect about the meaning of their results._x000D_
_x000D_
Altogether, we hope that our review will encourage researchers to put more effort in testing the basic hypothesis that the gender gap in mathematics performance can be explained as a stereotype threat, put more effort in a clear characterization of data, and last, but not least, be more careful with characterizing the current state of knowledge in the scientific literature and with discussions with the popular press. Ultimately, both psychological science and the general public, in particular girls and women, will be the winners if such an attitude is taken._x000D_","Men and women score similarly in most areas of mathematics, but a gap favoring men is consistently found at the high end of performance. One explanation for this gap, stereotype threat, was first proposed by Spencer, Steele, and Quinn (1999) and has received much attention. We discuss merits and shortcomings of this study and review replication attempts. Only 55% of the articles with experimental designs that could have replicated the original results did so. But half of these were confounded by statistical adjustment of preexisting mathematics exam scores. Of the unconfounded experiments, only 30% replicated the original. A meta-analysis of these effects confirmed that only the group of studies with adjusted mathematics scores displayed the stereotype threat effect. We conclude that although stereotype threat may affect some women, the existing state of knowledge does not support the current level of enthusiasm for this as a mechanism underlying the gender gap in mathematics. We argue there are many reasons to close this gap, and that too much weight on the stereotype explanation may hamper research and implementation of effective interventions.","4",0,"4","Political",5,0
67,11,"Spencer, S. J., Steele, C. M., & Quinn, D. M. (1999). Stereotype threat and women's math performance. Journal of experimental social psychology, 35(1), 4-28.","Being the potential target of a negative group stereotype, we have argued, creates a specific predicament: in any situation where the stereotype applies, behaviors and features of the individual that fit the stereotype make it plausible as a explanation of one‚Äôs performance. We call this predicament stereotype threat. The crux of our argument is that collectively held stereotypes in our society establish this kind of threat for women in settings that involve math performance, especially advanced math performance. The aim of the present research has been to show that this threat can quite substantially interfere with women‚Äôs math performance, especially performance that is at the limits of their skills, and that factors that remove this threat can improve that performance. _x000D_
_x000D_
The three experiments reported here provide strong and consistent support for this reasoning. Study 1 replicated the finding in the literature that women underperform on advanced tests but not on tests more within their skills. Study 2 attempted to directly manipulate stereotype threat by varying how the test was characterized‚Äîas one that generally found gender differences or as one that did not. Representing test performance as unaffected by gender, we reasoned, would make the gender stereotype irrelevant as an interpretation of test performance, preclude stereotype threat, and thereby allow women to match the performance of equally qualified men. This is precisely what happened in this condition, while in the condition where the same test was represented as affected by gender, women again underperformed in relation to men. Finally, Study 3 replicated the results of Study 2 with a less highly selected population and identified anxiety as a possible mediator of this effect. _x000D_
_x000D_
These findings also speak to the generality of stereotype threat‚Äôs negative effect on standardized test performance. Other research (Steele & Aronson, 1995; Croizet & Claire, 1998) has shown that stereotype threat can interfere with the performance of African‚ÄìAmerican and low socioeconomic students on difficult standardized tests. Thus, by showing a comparable effect among women test takers, the present findings help to establish the generality across groups of stereotype threat‚Äôs impairment of standardized test performance. _x000D_

This is not to say that there are no important differences in the way that stereotype threat affects different groups. We believe that such important differences do exist. For example, the nature of the stereotype about women‚Äôs math ability is different than the stereotype about African‚ÄìAmericans‚Äô ability in school. The stereotype about women is relatively confined‚Äîpertaining mainly to math and science‚Äîwhereas the stereotype about African‚ÄìAmericans is relatively broad, impugning almost all academic areas, which may lead to important differences in the way stereotype threat affects women and African‚ÄìAmericans. When women face stereotype threat in a math class, for instance, they can avoid it by dropping math and picking up most other classes. African‚ÄìAmericans, however, face a much more difficult problem when they face stereotype threat in school. For them it will be much more difficult to avoid. Women can still maintain a view of themselves as smart and capable, but just not good in math, if they disidentify with math. African‚ÄìAmericans, however, are likely to find it much more difficult to maintain a view of themselves as smart and capable, but just not able to cut it at school, if they disidentify with school. This reasoning suggests that stereotype threat may lead women to disidentify with math more readily than it leads African‚ÄìAmericans to disidentify with school. _x000D_

The Mediation of Stereotype Threat Effects _x000D_
Recent research by Steele and Aronson (1995) provided direct evidence of the psychological state that accompanies stereotype threat among African‚ÄìAmerican students taking a difficult standardized verbal test. As in the present research, they found that stereotype threat manipulations‚Äîfor example, making the negative stereotype about their intellectual ability either relevant or irrelevant to their test performance by representing the test as either diagnostic or nondiagnostic of ability‚Äîgreatly affected these participants‚Äô performance. But beyond this, they found that participants in the stereotype threat condition experienced a distinct psychological state marked by cognitive activation of racial stereotypes and strong motivation to avoid being judged by such stereotypes‚Äîa distinct state that accompanies stereotype threat. We have assumed that this state is experienced as a greater degree of self-evaluative threat‚Äîarising from their extra risk of fulfilling a negative group stereotype‚Äîand threat of this sort is likely to increase their emotionality (Baumeister & Showers, 1986; Geen, 1991; Sarason, 1972; Schlenker & Leary, 1982; Wine, 1971). _x000D_
_x000D_
The present studies tested this reasoning more directly. We found evidence that stereotype threat tended to increase anxiety, but we found little evidence that such emotionality mediates the observed stereotype threat effects. In particular, we found that anxiety showed only weak evidence of mediation and that evaluation apprehension and self-efficacy as we measured them in this study did not mediate the observed stereotype threat effects. These results suggest that the emotionality that we assumed undermined people‚Äôs performance when they experienced stereotype threat may accompany their performance but have little impact upon it. _x000D_
_x000D_
However, we should approach this conclusion with caution. There are several reasons why it may not be the final story on the mediation of stereotype threat effects. First, in Study 3 where we examined mediation, we only had 34 women, a relatively small sample to detect mediation. This limited power means that the lack of mediational evidence should be interpreted with caution. Second, in other situations and with other groups of subjects, the effects of stereotype threat may be mediated differently and some of the factors that we examined here that failed to show mediation might with other groups or in different situations. For example, in some situations, the mediation of stereotype threat effects may involve expectation effects. Lower expectations about both performance and self-efficacy are, after all, inherent parts of the stereotypes we are considering. Thus it is quite possible that the priming of these stereotypes in the stereotype threat conditions could lower expectations among the stereotyped. And this, in turn, could undermine their performance by undermining their motivation to perform (e.g., Bandura, 1977, 1986). Now Study 3 shows, we believe, that the effects of stereotype threat in the present experiments were not mediated in this way. Women‚Äôs performance expectations were not significantly affected by the stereotype threat manipulation and were not related to their test performance. This result is important in showing that stereotype threat has effects on performance that go beyond any effect it has on expectations and that it was these extra expectation effects that mediated the present results. _x000D_
_x000D_
Having made this point, however, we would stress that these effects are not always independent. In fact, lowered expectations in response to continued stereotype threat in a domain, and the demotivation this causes, may be critical precursors to disidentifying with the domain‚Äîthat is, to dropping the domain as an identification and as a basis of self-evaluation (see Major et al., 1998; Steele, 1992, 1997). Thus, while the present research shows that lowered expectations are not necessary mediators of stereotype threat effects, as the period of exposure to this threatening environment extends‚Äîas in the school settings to which we want to generalize‚Äîexpectations may play a more important mediational role. If this proves to be so, then a contribution of the present research is its identifying a new set of conditions that affect these expectations, namely, stereotype threat. _x000D_
_x000D_
Thus the question of how stereotype threat effects are mediated is a complex one. Certainly in real-life settings these effects are likely to be multiply mediated, involving several processes at once, anxiety, overcautiousness, lowered expectations, and so on. Thus a central challenge of ongoing research will be to discover which mediation occurs under which conditions. _x000D_

Stereotype Threat and the Genetic Interpretation of Gender Differences in Math Ability _x000D_
Our research also has implications for the lingering controversy over the role of biology versus the environment in determining the few sex differences that persist in mathematics performance. In its most recent incarnation, this issue has centered on the claims of Benbow and Stanley (1980, 1983). This much-cited research studied a group of seventh and eighth grade boys and girls, exceptionally talented in math, who scored above 700 on the quantitative section of the SAT. Boys were overrepresented in this group by a factor of 10 to 1. And since these boys and girls all had the same prior course work in math, the authors took this fact to indicate a sex difference in biological capacity for math. _x000D_
_x000D_
There have been several important critiques of this research and its conclusion (e.g., Eccles & Jacobs, 1986; Fennema, 1981; Jacobs & Eccles, 1985). A principal one is that being in the same classes does not mean that boys and girls have the same environment. Considerable research shows, for example, that boys and girls are treated very differently in the same classrooms (Constantinople, Cornelius, & Gray, 1988; Leinhardt, Seewald, & Engel, 1979). Over time, this argument goes, these differences in treatment, as well as differences in the larger societal socialization of women, could produce the findings that Benbow and Stanley report. While endorsing these arguments, we suggest that the present findings take them a step farther. The experience of the testing situation itself may be dramatically different for women and men. As the present research shows, stereotype threat as a feature of this situation can undermine women‚Äôs performance, precisely when the test is difficult. The seventh and eighth grade boys and girls in the Benbow and Stanley research, who are matched in eighth grade math ability, but given what for them is a very advanced math test (the quantitative SAT exam), are essentially in the same position as the participants in the high stereotype threat conditions in the present research. As this threat was able to dramatically depress the performance of talented women math students in the present experiments, it may well have depressed the performance of the talented girls in the Benbow and Stanley research. Thus we may not need to look to the earlier experience of these girls or to their biology to explain their performance. The critical factor may be the stereotype threat of the immediate test-taking situation.10 _x000D_
_x000D_
Finally, in the interest of careful generalization, we note several important parameters of the stereotype threat effect. It assumes that the test taker construes the test as a fairly valid assessment of math ability, that they still care about this ability at least somewhat, and that the test be difficult. Stereotype threat effects should be less likely if the test is either too easy or too difficult (either in item content or time allotted) to be seen as validly reflecting ability. Also, if the test taker has already disidentified with math, in the sense of not caring about their performance, stereotype threat is not likely to drive their performance lower than their lack of motivation would. Thus, it is only when the test reflects on ability and is difficult and the test takers care about this ability that the stereotype becomes relevant and disturbing as a potential self-characterization. For this reason, stereotype threat probably has its most disruptive real-life effects on women as they encounter new math material at the limits of their skills‚Äîfor example, new work units or a new curriculum level. _x000D_
_x000D_
This process may also contribute to women‚Äôs high attrition from quantitative fields, especially math, engineering, and the physical sciences, where their college attrition rate is 21 ‚ÅÑ2 times that of men (Hewitt & Seymour, 1991). At some point, continuously facing stereotype threat in these domains, women may disidentify with them and seek other domains on which to base their identity and esteem. While other factors surely contribute to this process‚Äîgender-role orientation (Eccles, 1984; Eccles et al., 1990;Yee & Eccles, 1988), lack of role models (Douvan, 1976; Hackett, Esposito, & O‚ÄôHalloran, 1989), and differential treatment of males and females in school (Constantinople et al., 1988; Peterson & Fennema, 1985)‚Äîwe suggest that stereotype threat may be an underappreciated source of these patterns. _x000D_
_x000D_
Embedded in our analysis is a certain hopefulness: the underperformance of women in quantitative fields may be more tractable than has been assumed. It attempts to understand the math performance of women not in terms of internal characteristics (e.g., abilities or internalized cultural orientations) but in terms of the interaction between the individual and a threatening predicament posed by societal stereotypes. Predicaments are circumstantial and thus should be easier to change than internalized characteristics. And though our experimental manipulations have yet to establish broadly generalizable strategies for changing this predicament, they do show that it can be changed._x000D_","When women perform math, unlike men, they risk being judged by the negative stereotype that women have weaker math ability. We call this predicamentstereotype threatand hypothesize that the apprehension it causes may disrupt women's math performance. In Study 1 we demonstrated that the pattern observed in the literature that women underperform on difficult (but not easy) math tests was observed among a highly selected sample of men and women. In Study 2 we demonstrated that this difference in performance could be eliminated when we lowered stereotype threat by describing the test as not producing gender differences. However, when the test was described as producing gender differences and stereotype threat was high, women performed substantially worse than equally qualified men did. A third experiment replicated this finding with a less highly selected population and explored the mediation of the effect. The implication that stereotype threat may underlie gender differences in advanced math performance, even those that have been attributed to genetically rooted sex differences, is discussed.","1",0,"1","Political",2,0

Nonetheless, we do not think that this should be the end of the biology and politics theory Oxley et al. helped initiate. Other fields have found that while the structure of the brain affects human behaviour, it does not do so in direct and easily measured ways44. Politics should be no different, especially given the complex personal experiences that politics evokes._x000D_
_x000D_
Failed replications always raise questions about why the original study‚Äôs findings were not supported. One possibility is that the underlying theory was either incorrect or bounded by unstated scope conditions. Another possibility is that differences between the original study and replication account for the discrepancy. Like all replications, ours differed in a few ways from the original study by Oxley et al.. First, our sampling strategy and sample characteristics did not match one-on-one the sampling strategy and sample of Oxley et al. We believe that this is an unlikely explanation for our failed replication. In line with recent work in the personality and politics literature45,46, and replication attempts in social psychology31, we find no evidence for a stronger association between threat sensitivity and social conservatism once we constrain our sample to people who more closely resemble those in the Oxley et al. sample with respect to age and race (question 10; Supplementary Figs. 32‚Äì45) or the distribution of social conservatism (question 11; Supplementary Fig. 46). Yet, other unknown differences caused by the different sampling strategies could potentially explain the different findings across the two studies. Replicating Oxley et al. using the same sampling strategy would provide a more definite answer, but even if our sample were the explanation for our null results, it would imply an unstated scope condition in the original study: namely, that it only applies to a particular population of people, as opposed to a general explanation for conservatism._x000D_
_x000D_
Second, our pre-registered replication consisted of the exact same threatening stimuli that Oxley et al. used. Oxley et al. interspersed these among a sequence of 33 images, some of which were positive. Yet, the exact content of the other images was not known to us. We interspersed the three threatening images among a sequence of 30 images (mostly taken from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS)), which were validated to be negative, positive or neutral. The basic procedure thereby matches the procedure of Oxley et al. We doubt that the different images we chose conditioned the results. Like Oxley et al., we randomized the order in which the images were shown. Recent work shows that the order in which threatening images are shown does not affect the response that people have to the images34. Indeed, our threatening images passed a basic manipulation check. Therefore, we do not think that the failure to replicate Oxley et al. can be attributed to unknown differences between the content of the other images used by Oxley et al. versus our images._x000D_
_x000D_
Third, we collected data in another part of the United States and the Netherlands. We can only speculate whether contextual differences explain the absence of a statistically significant association. On a theoretical level, Oxley et al. assert that the association between threat sensitivity and conservatism should be universal1,7,8. Consequently, if context conditions the link between physiological responses and conservatism, it would imply a scope condition unstated by Oxley et al. On an empirical level, large-scale replication projects in social psychology do not give much reason to presume that context conditions the outcome of replication studies31. At the same time, Malka and colleagues47 showed that the link between self-reported personality traits and social conservatism is stronger in countries with more ideological constraint. This would imply that we would find even weaker associations between threat sensitivity and social conservatism in countries with less ideological constraint. The only way to answer this question is to conduct more research using cross-country designs (see ref. 48 for a recent example)._x000D_
_x000D_
We see multiple opportunities for further research. Our study shows that using the exact same threatening (and disgusting) stimuli, as well as conceptually similar stimuli in the conceptual replications, leads to the same null findings. In our view, these null results are in line with the lack of theoretical and empirical evidence for the presence of an overarching physiological threat sensitivity dimension in recent neuroscience research. Of course, our view could be incorrect, and additional research could uncover a link between physiological responses and political ideology. For instance, it is possible that there are distinct sub-dimensions of physiological responses that tap into specific non-political threats (for example, snakes and spiders) as well as political threats (for example, violence), and these sub-dimensions could have distinct correlates with specific ideological sub-dimensions. Pre-registered, well-powered designs could speak to this question._x000D_
_x000D_
Furthermore, there is a long line of research in psychophysiology showing that negative stimuli evoke arousal fuelled by activation of the sympathetic nervous system49. Perhaps, the use of still images as stimuli is not the best way to evoke the kind of arousal that would signal individual differences in threat sensitivity. Stronger and more immersive stimuli, such real physical threats (for example, a spider in the room)50 or threats in a virtual reality environment51, are perhaps better equipped to capture individual differences in threat sensitivity. We welcome the next generation of research that would make use of more immersive stimuli._x000D_
_x000D_
Our study has broader implications for the literature in psychology and political science on the ideological asymmetry between liberals and conservatives. This literature predominantly relies on cross-sectional surveys in which self-reported traits are correlated with ideology52. The association between threat sensitivity and ideology has been considered an important piece of supporting evidence for the asymmetry thesis8. However, our failure to replicate the biological correlates of ideology aligns with recent work that questions the robustness of the personality and ideology association53. For instance, the content overlap between psychological traits and ideology might explain the association between personality and politics54. More troubling, panel studies failed to find evidence for the assumed causal effect of personality on ideology55,56, and the causal arrow may be reversed: people‚Äôs ideology might motivate them to express certain trait characteristics57. Therefore, while survey-based cross-sectional studies report consistent (albeit weak3) associations between personality and ideology, our study aligns with a small but growing body of literature that suggests a more critical assessment of the ideological asymmetry between liberals and conservatives._x000D_
_x000D_
To conclude, the field should move beyond the simplistic premise that unconscious reactions indicate real predispositions. Rather, unconscious reactions are one aspect of how the brain operates and one input into how people make decisions. One fruitful line of research would be to consider whether individual differences in the alignment between physiological reactions and experienced emotions explains the extent to which people‚Äôs political attitudes are rooted in intuitions versus being regulated by top-down processes. This may also help scholars sort out when expressed political beliefs and attitudes are sincere and when they are expressive. Whatever the case, we urge more, not less, research at the intersection of neuroscience and politics. It will not be easy, but profitable avenues of research rarely are.","About a decade ago, a study documented that conservatives have stronger physiological responses to threatening stimuli than liberals. This work launched an approach aimed at uncovering the biological roots of ideology. Despite wide-ranging scientific and popular impact, independent laboratories have not replicated the study. We conducted a pre-registered direct replication (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ202) and conceptual replications in the United States (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ352) and the Netherlands (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ81). Our analyses do not support the conclusions of the original study, nor do we find evidence for broader claims regarding the effect of disgust and the existence of a physiological trait. Rather than studying unconscious responses as the real predispositions, alignment between conscious and unconscious responses promises deeper insights into the emotional roots of ideology.","4",0,"4","Political",4,1

Psychological science, 18(10), 879-885.","How do people come to know whether social identity threat is ‚Äúin the air‚Äù in a particular setting? In the present study, people relied on the organizational features of a setting to help them determine the likelihood of encountering identity threat in that setting. We manipulated the situational cue of gender representation in an MSE setting among a population of men and women who were highly identified with MSE domains, hypothesizing that the cue would affect a broad array of outcomes among the women, including their objective experiences of identity threat, such as their levels of cognitive and physiological vigilance, as well as their subjective experiences of threat, such as their sense of belonging and desire to participate in the setting._x000D_
_x000D_
The results provided strong support for the cues hypothesis. Women who watched the gender-unbalanced MSE video showed more vigilance to both the details of the conference video and cues in their physical context, compared with women who watched the gender-balanced video. Also, women showed faster heart rates, greater skin conductance, and greater sympathetic activation of the cardiovascular system while watching the gender-unbalanced video than while watching the gender-balanced video. Finally, women anticipated a lower sense of belonging in the conference and reported less desire to participate in it after watching the unbalanced video than after watching the balanced video. The cue of gender representation did not significantly affect any of the men's outcomes except their desire to participate in the conference. Both men and women wanted to participate in the conference more when it was depicted as gender balanced rather than unbalanced. Though this effect was likely a result of different concerns among the two groups‚Äîperhaps women felt more identity-safe among other women, whereas men might have been attracted by the uncommon number of women in the gender-balanced MSE environment‚Äîit is nonetheless interesting that both groups favored an MSE environment containing more women._x000D_
_x000D_
Taken together, the compelling convergence of subjective and objective indicators signals a meaningful experience of social identity threat among women in the gender-unbalanced setting. Thus, women who were highly identified with MSE domains relied on the cue of numerical representation to assess the degree of identity threat in this context. These data demonstrate that rather than being endemic to women, the experience of identity threat is attributable to the situation‚Äîits cues and organization._x000D_
_x000D_
Why were men's outcomes unaffected by the cue of numerical representation? Because men are not traditionally stereotyped or outnumbered in MSE domains, the cue of numerical representation may not hold significant meaning for them in MSE settings.3 However, previous work has shown that men can be quite sensitive to other situational cues in MSE domains. In studies involving a math tutorial setting, men used cues including the gender of the math tutor and the tutor's reputation to assess their own level of identity threat (Murphy & Steele, 2007). In addition, research has demonstrated that when White men are vulnerable to a stereotype‚Äîsuch as when they are compared with Asian men in a math context or with Black men in an athletic context‚Äîthey show stereotype-threat performance decrements similar to those of women who are compared with men in a math context (Aronson et al., 1999; Stone, Lynch, Sjomeling, & Darley, 1999)._x000D_
_x000D_
Although the present study highlights the extensive effects of gender representation on women in an MSE setting, it has some limitations. First, because women who are highly identified with the MSE domains are the ones who will most likely enter MSE professions‚Äîhelping to address their gender's underrepresentation in MSE fields‚Äîthe present study tested the broad effects of one cue among this particular population of women. However, it is unclear whether the results will generalize to populations not highly identified with these domains. Perhaps other cues‚Äîsuch as the gender segregation of different MSE tracks or the gender of MSE teachers‚Äîmight be stronger signals of identity threat for students not yet identified with MSE domains. Because both entry and retention of women in MSE domains remain problematic, studying the situational cues that affect both women who are highly domain identified and women who are not is a worthwhile endeavor._x000D_
_x000D_
Second, it is difficult to imagine an MSE setting where only a single situational cue is present, as it was in this experiment. As James (1890, p. 462) aptly stated, ‚Äúthe world is a buzzing, blooming confusion‚Äù made even more so by the many situational cues found in each new setting that people encounter. Future work should examine the effects of multiple cues in settings. In fact, research has demonstrated that situational cues can interact in interesting ways to affect important outcomes, such as people's level of trust in a setting (Purdie-Vaughns, Steele, Davies, & Crosby, 2007)._x000D_
_x000D_
Despite these limitations, the present research demonstrates that potentially stigmatized groups are significantly affected by situational cues that speak to the likelihood of encountering identity threat in a setting. Thus, the way an environment is organized has important meaning and impact for groups who may be vulnerable to identity threat. As we have shown, when a setting contains threatening situational cues, it raises the specter of identity threat‚Äîprompting heightened cognitive and physiological vigilance, decreased feelings of belonging, and decreased desire to participate in the setting. It is our hope that the present research underlines the importance of situational cues and inspires greater motivation to attend to such cues when creating and modifying environments so that they may foster perceptions of identity safety rather than threat._x000D_","This study examined the cues hypothesis, which holds that situational cues, such as a setting's features and organization, can make potential targets vulnerable to social identity threat. Objective and subjective measures of identity threat were collected from male and female math, science, and engineering (MSE) majors who watched an MSE conference video depicting either an unbalanced ratio of men to women or a balanced ratio. Women who viewed the unbalanced video exhibited more cognitive and physiological vigilance, and reported a lower sense of belonging and less desire to participate in the conference, than did women who viewed the gender-balanced video. Men were unaffected by this situational cue. The implications for understanding vulnerability to social identity threat, particularly among women in MSE settings, are discussed.","1",0,"1","Political",2,1
70,12,"Jaeger, B., Evans, A. M., Stel, M., & van Beest, I. (2019). Explaining the persistent influence of facial cues in social decision-making. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 148(6), 1008.","We asked whether reliance on facial trustworthiness in social decision-making can be explained by beliefs in the diagnosticity of the cue (i.e., by subjective cue weighing) or by the fact that the cue is intuitively accessible, which makes it relatively effortless to rely on it (i.e., by intuitive accessibility). Across six studies, we systematically tested how much people rely on facial trustworthiness and economic payoff information (i.e., the trustee‚Äôs temptation to betray trust)‚Äîa cue that is perceived to be more valid but takes more effort to process. Across our studies, we find consistent support for the intuitive accessibility account. _x000D_
_x000D_
In Study 1, we found that economic payoff information is seen as a more valid cue than facial information. Study 2 showed there was a positive correlation between reliance on economic payoffs and decision time, while no such relationship was found for reliance on facial trustworthiness. These findings replicated in Study 3a‚Äì3c, with a substantially larger sample. To the extent that longer response times are an indicator for more effortful decision strategies (Bettman et al., 1990), these results suggest that it takes less cognitive effort to rely on facial trustworthiness rather than temptation. Thus, Study 1 identified economic payoff information as a cue that is seen as more valid, whereas Study 2 and Study 3a‚Äì3c showed that economic payoff information is also more effortful to process than facial trustworthiness. _x000D_
_x000D_
In Study 3a‚Äì3c, we tested to what extent people rely on economic payoff information and facial trustworthiness when both cues are available simultaneously. Results showed that people rely less on a subjectively more valid cue (i.e., temptation) when facial trustworthiness is available as well. However, people do not rely less on facial trustworthiness when temptation is simultaneously manipulated. This pattern of results is in line with the argument that persistent reliance on facial trustworthiness is driven by the intuitive accessibility of the cue. If cognitive reflection is required for reliance on economic payoff information, but not for reliance on facial cues, then we would expect that restricting reflection during decision-making only decreases the influence of payoff information, but not the influence of facial cues. This prediction was tested in Study 4. This final study confirmed that payoff information had a diminished effect on trust when people made intuitive (vs. reflective) decisions. Taken together, our data suggest that the persistent reliance on facial trustworthiness can be better explained by the intuitively accessibility of the cue, which makes reliance on it relatively effortless, rather than by the belief that it is a particularly valid cue. _x000D_
_x000D_
Decision Effort and Trust _x000D_
The present results converge with prior research on the processing of trait information from faces. A host of studies has demonstrated that trustworthiness impressions from faces are formed in a particularly efficient manner (Bonnefon et al., 2013; Klapper et al., 2016; Willis & Todorov, 2006). We extend these findings by showing that reliance on economic payoff information requires more effort than reliance on facial cues. Similar results were observed when we manipulated how much people could reflect on their decisions. Intuitive decisions were less reliant on economic payoff information, but the manipulation of reflection time had no effect on reliance on facial cues. Our interpretation that reliance on facial trustworthiness is relatively effortless is also in line with studies showing that subjecting participants to a cognitive load manipulation does not impair their use of facial cues when making trust decisions (Bonnefon et al., 2013; De Neys et al., 2017; Mieth et al., 2016). _x000D_
_x000D_
In Study 2 and Study 3a‚Äì3c, we measured response times as a proxy for the cognitive effort needed to make a decision (Bettman et al., 1990). Previous investigations in the domain of social decision-making have highlighted that other factors such as decision conflict can also drive response times (Evans, Dillon, & Rand, 2015; Krajbich et al., 2015). Perhaps, decision-makers felt more conflicted when relying on temptation, which increased their decision times. According to this view, we would also expect participants to be less confident when relying on temptation as decision conflict is associated with decreased confidence (De Neys et al., 2011; Zakay, 1985). Yet, across our studies, we found no evidence that participants reported lower levels of confidence in the presence of temptation as opposed to facial trustworthiness, suggesting that decision conflict was not driving our results. _x000D_
_x000D_
Our results also fit within broader frameworks of how people decide whom to trust. With regard to the question which cues people rely on in trust situations, Evans and Krueger (2016) suggest in their model of bounded prospection that people approach trust decisions egocentrically: People focus on their potential costs and benefits while neglecting the probability that these outcomes will occur as assessing an interaction partner‚Äôs trustworthiness requires perspective-taking and thus cognitive effort (S. Lin, Keysar, & Epley, 2010). We go beyond contrasting cues pertaining to the self with cues pertaining to the situation (Thielmann & Hilbig, 2015) or the interaction partner (Evans & Krueger, 2011) and provide evidence for a more general claim that the extent to which people rely on information in trust decisions with multiple cues is determined by the ease with which the information is processed. _x000D_
_x000D_
Limitations and Future Research _x000D_
We provided evidence that the persistent reliance on facial trustworthiness can at least partly be explained by the intuitive accessibility of face judgments. We demonstrated this by showing that people favor relying on facial trustworthiness over temptation even though the latter is seen as a more valid cue. More specifically, we found that people did not rely less on facial trustworthiness when they could also rely on temptation. This finding stands in contrast to previous studies showing that people discount facial cues when other information is available (Graham, Harvey, & Puri, 2017; Rezlescu et al., 2012; Yu, Saleem, & Gonzalez, 2014). For example, Rezlescu and colleagues (2012) showed that the influence of facial trustworthiness on trust decisions was reduced, but not eliminated, when information on a partner‚Äôs past behavior was available. Maybe the subjective validity of temptation is still comparatively low and a stronger cue would have reduced or even eliminated reliance on facial cues in our studies. Arguably, people may prioritize past behavior over facial trustworthiness because past behavior is both easy to process and subjectively valid. To date, there is relatively little work that examines how people prioritize different types of cues in dilemmas of trust; future studies need to test how reliance on facial trustworthiness changes in the presence of different cues that vary in both subjective validity and ease of accessibility. _x000D_
_x000D_
In addition, more research is needed to understand how the efficient processing of faces influences cue selection and cue weighing. Following the fast accessibility of face judgments, do people ignore other cues altogether? Our results speak against such a strong version of one-reason decision-making (Gigerenzer et al., 2008) as the effect of temptation was still apparent even when decision-makers could have relied solely on facial trustworthiness. Individual differences in rational versus heuristic processing (Epstein, Pacini, Denes-Raj, & Heier, 1996) or need for cognition (Cacioppo & Petty, 1982) might help explain why some individuals reach a decision after face judgments are accessible whereas other consider additional cues. People who score higher on heuristic processing may rely more on facial trustworthiness even when other cues are available._x000D_
_x000D_
Alternatively, it could be the case that our participants did in fact consider all available cues but that the efficient processing of faces influenced how the cues were weighed. Shah (2007) has argued that efficiently processed cues are weighed more heavily. Because participants only read a description of the face cue and did not experience the efficient processing of it in Study 1, our measure of subjective cue validity might have underestimated how valid participants perceived the cue to be while making decisions. However, Dimov and Link (2017) showed that processing efficiency does not affect cue weights, but rather the order in which cues are considered. In the context of our study, it is thus conceivable that the discounting of temptation was due to a sequential process where fast facial trustworthiness judgments anchored participants‚Äô response and subsequent adjustment on the basis of temptation was insufficient (Tamir & Mitchell, 2013). This view holds that the primary processing of faces influences the weighing of subsequently processed cues. Future research could test whether a serial presentation of cues, where participants first learn about temptation and then see the face of their interaction partner, eliminates the discounting of temptation in favor of facial trustworthiness.7 _x000D_

Implications for Debiasing Interventions _x000D_
The primary goal of our current investigation was to shed light on the process giving rise to the face bias. In addition, our findings may also be used to inform the design of interventions aimed at curbing the bias. One previously proposed recommendation is to inform decision-makers about the poor accuracy of their impressions (Porter et al., 2010). Our results suggest that this approach might not be sufficient as the face bias does not stem from a conscious (albeit subjective) weighing of cues (Dawes et al., 1989; T. D. Wilson & Brekke, 1994). Another idea would be to increase the importance of the decision in order to motivate people to process the available information more deeply (Chaiken, 1980; Chaiken & Maheswaran, 1994) or to reduce processing constraints (e.g., time pressure) or decision complexity (Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996; Payne et al., 1988). Both approaches might lead to an attenuation of the face bias, but we are skeptical that it will completely eliminate reliance on facial cues. Previous studies have shown that the influence of facial trustworthiness persists for extremely important decisions, such as legal sentencing (Blair, Judd, & Fallman, 2004; Eberhardt, Davies, Purdie-Vaughns, & Johnson, 2006; J. P. Wilson & Rule, 2015) or voting (Olivola & Todorov, 2010a), as well as for relatively simple, self-paced decisions in the lab (Mieth et al., 2016; Rezlescu et al., 2012). As a further case in point, Study 4 showed that, while making people reflect on their decision increased their reliance on temptation, we found no evidence that it reduced the influence of facial trustworthiness. _x000D_
_x000D_
Our findings suggest that interventions that disrupt the primary and efficient processing of faces might hold more potential for success. Inverting photos or misaligning its parts might disrupt the efficient processing of faces while still enabling the identification of an individual (Bindemann, Burton, Hooge, Jenkins, & de Haan, 2005; Todorov, Loehr, & Oosterhof, 2010), but requesting photos to be displayed upside-down in case files or on websites such as Airbnb is not realistic. However, in many situations, decisionmakers could be asked to reach a decision in absence of facial cues first‚Äîideally based on valid information. In the next step, a photo is displayed while the decision can still be revised. With this setup, initial decisions should be less biased. Any incorporation of face judgments into the decision-making process would now require a conscious revision of the decision, which is less likely if more diagnostic cues are also available. Future studies should test interventions targeting the efficient processing of faces and compare their effectiveness to simply teaching decision-makers about the biasing potential of faces. _x000D_
_x000D_
Conclusion _x000D_
Despite their poor predictive validity, face judgments influence decisions ranging from the relatively trivial choice of which apartment to rent (which might determine the fate of the next vacation; Ert et al., 2016), to the selection of a CEO (which might determine the fate of a company; Gomulya et al., 2017; Graham et al., 2017; Stoker, Garretsen, & Spreeuwers, 2016), to the sentencing of a criminal (which might determine the fate of a human being; Blair et al., 2004; Eberhardt et al., 2006; J. P. Wilson & Rule, 2015). It may thus not be surprising that researchers have called for a more nuanced understanding of why people persistently rely on face judgments (Olivola et al., 2014). We contribute to this debate by showing that peoples‚Äô reliance on face judgments is better explained by the intuitive accessibility of the cue, which make reliance on it relatively effortless, rather than by beliefs that facial cues are particularly valid. We recommend that future attempts at designing interventions focus on disrupting the primary and efficient processing of faces to attenuate the effects of face judgments on social decisions._x000D_","Impressions of trustworthiness based on facial cues influence many consequential decisions, in spite of their (generally) poor accuracy. Here, we test whether reliance on facial cues can be better explained by (a) the belief that facial cues are more valid than other cues or by (b) the quick and primary processing of faces, which makes relying on facial cues relatively effortless. Six studies (N = 2,732 with 73,182 trust decisions) test the two accounts by comparing the effects of facial cues and economic payoffs on trust decisions. People believe that facial cues are less valid than economic payoffs (Study 1) but relying on facial cues takes less time than relying on economic payoffs (Study 2). Critically, introducing facial cues causes people to discount payoff information, but introducing payoff information does not reduce the effect of facial cues (Studies 3a‚Äìc). Finally, when making intuitive (vs. reflective) trust decisions, people rely less on payoff information, but they do not rely less on facial cues (Study 4). Together, these findings suggest that persistent reliance on facial trustworthiness is better explained by the intuitive accessibility of facial cues, rather than beliefs that facial cues are particularly valid.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Political",4,1
71,12,"Jaeger, B., & Sleegers, W. W. (2023). Racial disparities in the sharing economy: Evidence from more than 100,000 Airbnb hosts across 14 countries. Journal of the Association for Consumer Research, 8(1), 33-46.","Sellers in sharing economy markets are often required (or strongly encouraged) to display personal information, such as profile photos and names, in order to reduce anonymity and enhance trust between consumers and sellers (Guttentag 2013). However, disclosing personal information may come at a cost for some sellers, as studies suggest that consumers use this information to discriminate against sellers from racial minorities (K√∂bis et al. 2020). For instance, a recent experiment found that the same Airbnb apartment was evaluated more negatively and less likely to be chosen by participants when it was advertised by a host from a racial minority (N√∏dtvedt et al. 2020). Lower demand for apartments of racial minorities should negatively influence their earning opportunities. In line with these idea, our analysis of more than 100,000 listings across 24 cities, 14 countries, and 3 continents consistently showed that non-White hosts charge significantly lower prices for qualitatively similar apartments compared to White hosts. Three key findings emerged from our studies.

First, price disparities disfavoring Airbnb hosts from racial minorities are widespread. In study 2 (ùëõ=12,648), we analyzed data from 16 cities across the United States (the country with the most Airbnb listings worldwide) and found price disparities of 7.39% and 5.94% for Black hosts and Asian hosts, respectively. Previous studies mostly focused on a few Airbnb markets (e.g., Edelman and Luca 2014; Jaeger et al. 2019), which raised questions about the generalizability of the observed price disparities. Many parameters that plausibly influence racial disparities vary substantially across cities and regions, including the prevalence of hosts from racial minorities and the types of guests that visit the place. We analyzed a larger and more representative set of US markets and found that racial price gaps were apparent in all 16 cities analyzed here.

Second, going beyond previous studies, our results show that racial price disparities are also apparent outside of the United States. In study 1 (ùëõ=96,150), we focused on the 24 largest Airbnb markets worldwide (in countries with a predominantly White population) and found that, on average, non-White hosts charge 2.74% lower prices for qualitatively similar apartments. Racial price gaps were again common: We found price disparities favoring White hosts in 20 out of the 24 cities that were analyzed.

Third, although we consistently found price disparities in favor of White hosts, the exact size of the disparity varied. We were particularly interested in examining whether price disparities would vary depending on whether a listing is shared or not. If price disparities reflect consumers‚Äô reluctance to stay with non-White hosts, then this disparity might be stronger when guests share the listing with the host, rather than rent it out entirely. In other words, potential guests might be particularly reluctant to stay with a host from a racial minority when they anticipate to have more direct contact with the host. Results of study 1 showed evidence for this hypothesis: Racial price disparities were significantly larger for listings that were shared with hosts. A similar effect was not observed in study 2, which may have been due to the smaller sample size or the exclusive focus on listings in the United States.

Practical Implications
Sharing economy platforms often highlight that providing personal information is crucial to foster trust between consumers and sellers (Airbnb 2013). However, a growing number of studies suggest that people rely on this information to discriminate against sellers from racial minorities. Given the prevalence of personal information on sellers‚Äô profiles across different sharing economy platforms, it is likely that racial price disparities not only exist on Airbnb, but across the sharing economy. In fact, while the majority of studies have focused on Airbnb, other work has found racial disparities on BlaBlaCar (Farajallah, Hammond, and P√©nard 2016), Uber, and Lyft (Ge et al. 2020). This is particularly problematic because the relatively low barriers to becoming a seller make sharing economy markets attractive to economically disadvantaged groups (Dillahunt and Malone 2015). In short, evidence is accumulating that racial discrimination is a common phenomenon across the sharing economy and that this may be enabled by common design features of sharing economy platforms.

Sharing personal information can have advantages and disadvantages for sellers. On the one hand, profile photos contain information that is perceived to be relevant by consumers (Eckel and Petrie 2011). Although more evidence is needed to test this hypothesis, providing profile photos may increase consumer trust and engagement. On the other hand, results of the current and previous studies suggest that profile photos and other types of personal information can enable discrimination. When deciding how to balance these concerns, the priorities of sellers and the platforms they are featured on may not be aligned (Buhalis, Andreu, and Gnoth 2020). Sharing economy platforms have an incentive to provide as much personal information as possible if this increases consumer engagement (and, therefore, the company‚Äôs revenue). It is individual sellers who will experience the negative externalities of this design feature. Sellers should be aware of this potential conflict between their own interests (e.g., anonymity, fair treatment) and the platform‚Äôs interests (e.g., transparency, consumer trust).

To reduce the prevalence of discrimination in the sharing economy, more fundamental changes to the design of the platforms may be needed (Lee et al. 2021). Parallels can be drawn to changes in hiring procedures to mitigate discrimination. In many countries, it is now uncommon (or even prohibited) to ask applicants to include a photo or other personal information in their application. A similar intervention may be needed in the sharing economy. Again, it should be noted that these changes are unlikely to be initiated by the companies themselves if they face competing incentives. In the case of Airbnb, many hosts have already voiced their discontent by sharing their negative experiences on Twitter under the hashtag ‚Äúairbnbwhileblack.‚Äù Media coverage of the issue may help raise public awareness. Ultimately, legislation may be needed to ensure that the same level of protection from discrimination that is available to sellers and buyers in more traditional markets (e.g., the housing market) also extends to the sharing economy.

The current results should be seen as a snap shot of racial price disparities on Airbnb at the time the studies were conducted. Airbnb is continuously updating its booking procedures and web design, which may influence the extent to which racial biases emerge. Recently, Airbnb announced additional efforts to study and mitigate discrimination on its platform (Airbnb 2020). It remains to be seen how these changes will impact racial disparities on the platform.

Limitations and Future Directions
Following previous investigations (e.g., Edelman and Luca 2014), we investigated racial discrimination on Airbnb by testing whether hosts from racial minorities charge lower prices for qualitatively similar listings compared to White hosts. If consumers favor staying with White hosts then they will have a lower willingness to pay for the apartments of hosts from racial minorities, all else being equal. As a consequence, White hosts will be able to charge higher prices for similar apartments compared to non-White hosts. One strength of our approach is that it does not rely on examining participants‚Äô hypothetical choices in response to simplified descriptions of fictitious listings. Our analyses provide insights into consumers‚Äô actual choices on the platform. Lab experiments, such as the series of experiments conducted by N√∏dtvedt and colleagues (2020), afford more control over the factors that may influence rental choices allowing for cleaner causal inferences. However, lab experiments often only poorly approximate the conditions under which real-world choices are made, raising questions about the external validity of results. Racial disparities may be smaller in the lab than in real life because participants are aware that their choices are studied which could lead them to give socially desirable responses. Racial disparities may also be larger in the lab than in real life because real-world choices occur in noisier environments with more information that guests can rely on.

One limitation of our approach is that, due to its correlational nature, we can be less confident about the causal role of hosts‚Äô race. It is possible that price disparities are not caused by racially biased preferences of consumers, but by other factors, such as differences in the quality of apartments between White and non-White hosts. For example, it is plausible that White hosts live in more attractive neighborhoods. As a consequence, White hosts may be able to attract more guests and charge higher prices not because guests are willing to pay more to stay with White hosts, but because they favor staying in attractive neighborhoods. To address this issue, we controlled for a large set of potential confounds in our analyses (see table 1) including attributes of the listing (e.g., number of bedrooms, review scores, the unemployment and poverty rate in the listing‚Äôs zip code), the host (gender, age), and the booking process (e.g., cleaning fees, strictness of the cancelation policy). We find that many desirable characteristics are positively related to the price of listings, as predicted by hedonic pricing theory (Rosen 1974; Malpezzi 2008). For example, listings located in more desirable neighborhoods (as indicated by higher average rental prices in the listing‚Äôs zip code) and listings with more positive location review scores were more expensive, which suggests that hosts take advantage of guests‚Äô higher willingness to pay for apartments located in attractive locations. We also find that White hosts tend to live in more attractive locations. We therefore controlled for location attractiveness and many other potential confounds in our studies. The fact that racial price disparities emerge even after controlling for a large set of potential confounds makes it more likely that price disparities reflect consumers‚Äô lower willingness to pay for listings of non-White hosts.

Two additional considerations support the idea that rental decisions on Airbnb are influenced by racial preferences. In a recent lab experiment, N√∏dtvedt and colleagues (2020) manipulated the perceived race of Airbnb hosts by manipulating their profile photo and name. In line with the idea that hosts‚Äô race influences booking decisions, Norwegian participants showed stronger preferences for an apartment when it was rented out by ‚ÄúMartin from Norway‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúAbdi from Somalia.‚Äù Moreover, if racial price disparities result from a disinclination to stay with hosts from racial minorities, then disparities should be larger when consumers can expect to have more direct contact with hosts. Results from study 1 supported this prediction. Racial price disparities were larger when listings were shared with hosts rather than rented out entirely.

These findings also speak against another alternative explanation of the present results. Racial price disparities may not be due to lower demand for apartments of non-White hosts by racially biased consumers, but due to White hosts setting higher prices irrespective of demand, for example, because of an increased sense of entitlement. In general, it is plausible that the prices that hosts set for their apartments are not perfectly calibrated to the demand that they experience but are also influenced by various other factors. However, this account would not predict that racial price disparities are larger when guests have more contact with the host, which we observed in study 1, or that experimental manipulations of hosts‚Äô race would influence apartment choices, which was observed by N√∏dtvedt and colleagues (2020). Overall, the current findings support the interpretation that the observed price disparities reflect racially biased preferences of consumers.

Our large sample of cities and hosts and converging results from different analyses attest to the robustness of the price disparity in favor of White hosts. However, the exact size of the disparity should be interpreted with caution, as it depends on several methodological and statistical choices such as which cities and hosts were included in the analysis and which potential confounds were statistically controlled for. A comparison of results for cities that were analyzed in studies 1 and 2 illustrates this point. The two studies used different inclusion criteria and control variables and, although results were similar for some cities (e.g., 5.6% vs. 8.0% lower prices for Asian hosts in San Diego), others showed larger differences (e.g., 13.7% vs. 2.0% lower prices for Black hosts in New York City).

The current analysis focused on a large set of countries in Europe, Australia, and North America. This allowed us to test how widespread racial price disparities are, but it also introduced substantial heterogeneity in the racial groups that were represented in our data set. Even though we focused on countries with a White majority, the exact racial compositions of countries differed substantially. Our data show that non-White hosts charge lower prices for qualitatively similar listings across various cities and countries, but more cross-cultural work is needed to map which racial groups are affected most in each country. Results of study 2 provide first insights into this question. Although both Black and Asian hosts charged lower prices than White hosts in all cities, the price gap for Black hosts was larger. Additional studies are also needed to examine racial disparities in countries with a predominantly non-White population. On the one hand, we might observe price disparities that disfavor White hosts in these countries if consumers avoid staying with hosts from racial minorities. On the other hand, we might still find price disparities that favor White hosts because being White is a (true or perceived) indicator of status and wealth in some countries (e.g., South Africa) and consumers may therefore prefer to stay with White hosts even though they constitute the racial outgroup. Similarly, future studies could test whether the size of the racial price gap across cities is associated with the racial diversity, the prevalence of specific racial groups, or other characteristics of cities.

In general, the current analyses leave open the question of how the race of consumers and hosts interacts in shaping booking decisions. Some consumers may prefer to stay with a White host because they are (consciously or unconsciously) avoiding contact with a person from a racial outgroup. Alternatively, consumers may hold the (accurate or inaccurate) belief that stays with White hosts are somehow better. These different accounts map onto the common distinction between taste-based and statistical discrimination (Becker 2010). Future analyses that consider the race of consumers may help to shed light on the process underlying racially biased booking decisions. For example, if decisions are driven by the motivation to avoid racial outgroups (i.e., taste-based discrimination), then Black hosts should be avoided by White, but not by Black guests. If decisions are driven by stereotypes that stays with White hosts are somehow better (i.e., statistical discrimination), then Black hosts may be avoided by both White and Black guests. Future work could also examine how racial biases affect the experiences of Airbnb guest, such as whether non-White guests receive poorer service (e.g., Bone et al. 2023).

In the present investigation, we relied on face classification algorithms to code the race of Airbnb hosts based on their profile photo. Using automated procedures instead of human raters has several key advantages. Coding a large number of hosts requires many participants and previous work often focused on a subset of all available listings in one or a few Airbnb markets due to limitations in participant pool size or research budget (e.g., Kakar et al. 2018). Relying on automated procedures circumvents this problem and allowed us to examine large samples of listings across many different markets. Yet, relying on algorithms also has disadvantages. The algorithm that was used in study 1 classified hosts into four categories: White, Black, Asian, and Indian. This may not capture all racial groups in a given country. Moreover, race classification algorithms rely on perceptual cues that are easily detectable and discriminate between different racial groups (e.g., skin color). Previous studies found relatively high levels of accuracy in race classification, especially for Black and White targets (Jaeger et al. 2020). However, accuracy may be lower for racial groups that are more perceptually ambiguous. Given these limitations, we decided to focus on the broader distinction between White and non-White hosts in study 1. Moreover, in study 2, we only focused on hosts that were classified with high confidence to reduce measurement error.

Additional work is needed to better understand how racial preferences of consumers translate into lower prices (and, presumably, lower earnings) for hosts from racial minorities. Airbnb and other websites offer algorithms with which hosts can determine a reasonable price for their listing. Algorithm suggests a price by comparing the host‚Äôs listing to similar listings, but the exact features that influence this recommendation are not clear. If prices in the algorithm‚Äôs training set reflect racially biased preferences of consumers, then these biases may be reflected in (and propagated by) the algorithm‚Äôs suggestions. Racial preferences could also be reflected in reviews of listings. A negative review of a host from a racial minority that was, at least partially, due to prejudice could deter future guests even if they are unbiased. Again, this mechanism would propagate racial price disparities.

Conclusion
Our analysis of more than 100,000 Airbnb listings across 24 cities, 14 countries, and 3 continents revealed widespread price disparities favoring White hosts who are able to charge higher prices for qualitatively similar listings. We also find some evidence that racial price disparities were larger when listings were shared with hosts, that is, when consumers could anticipate to have more direct contact with their hosts. Although the exact size of the racial price gap varied substantially across different cities, it emerged in 20 out of the 24 largest Airbnb markets worldwide and in all 16 US cities examined here. Our findings are in line with experimental work showing that consumers prefer to stay with White hosts, which allows them to charge higher prices for their listings.","Sharing economy platforms, such as Airbnb, often requires (or strongly encourages) hosts to share personal information, such as names and profile photos.

We also found an association between scores on the Francis scale and scores on the Purpose in Life test and the Index of Self-Actualisation. It would seem therefore that the discrepancies found in previous research are not a function of different operational definitions of happiness. An explanation for these inconsistent findings remains uncertain. But although positive associations were found between religiosity and the two happiness measures, when purpose in life was partialled out, the associations no longer remained. We would conclude therefore that the association between religiosity and happiness might be accounted for by purpose in life. Religious people would seem to have a greater sense of purpose in life, and after taking this cognitive component of subjective well-being into account, there remains no evidence that religious people are happier.","The aim of the present work was to test for an association between religiosity and happiness.

73,12,"Brandt, M. J. (2017). Predicting ideological prejudice. Psychological Science, 28(6), 713-722.","I tested whether I could use perceived group characteristics to predict the size and direction of the association between participants‚Äô ideology and their prejudice against a variety of target groups. Results showed that the models using perceived ideology (and, to a lesser degree, conventionalism) can be used to make precise predictions about when people will exhibit prejudice. The predictive success of perceived ideology outstripped that of both perceived status and perceived choice in membership. These latter dimensions of group perception are often tied to expressions of prejudice (Fiske, Cuddy, & Glick, 2007; Haslam et al., 2006; Sidanius & Pratto, 2001), especially ideologically based prejudice (Duckitt, 2006; Suhay & Jayaratne, 2013). However, status and choice may make only a small contribution to prejudice when in direct competition with perceived political ideology, as they were in the current studies._x000D_
_x000D_
There are limitations to the approach taken in this research. First, the predictive models were developed using one measure of explicit prejudice. Although this measure is a common one (Correll et al., 2010), it is not known if the precise model predictions would extend to other measures and, especially, if they would extend to measures of implicit prejudice. For example, it might be the case that status is more important for predicting the association between ideology and implicit prejudice. Answers to these questions will help further refine the models. Also, although the models were predictive in the sense that they accurately predicted the observations in future studies, the ideology-prejudice association is cross-sectional. The purpose of this study was not to pin down a causal connection, but rather to maximize prediction (Yarkoni & Westfall, in press). Finally, this study focused on ideology, and the results suggest that dissimilarity along the ideological dimension is important for understanding ideological prejudice, but that does not mean that dissimilarity is limited to politics. The effect of dissimilarity on prejudice is pervasive (Byrne, 1969; Wynn, 2016)._x000D_
_x000D_
One might point to the unrepresentative Mechanical Turk samples to discount the findings. Although these samples have shortcomings, the findings obtained with them closely adhered to the findings obtained using the 2016 ANES Pilot Study and to the predictions of the models developed from the 2012 ANES survey, both of which are based on nationally representative samples. Another possible critique is that if status and choice in membership did not have reliable effects in the model-building phase, it would not be possible for status-only and choice-only models to demonstrate predictive accuracy greater than that of the null model. However, the results of exploratory analyses using group characteristics to predict the ideology-prejudice association in Studies 1 through 4 were similar to the results in the model-building phase (see Tables S8‚ÄìS11 in the Supplemental Material). That is, status and choice remained unreliable predictors._x000D_
_x000D_
This study of the ideology-prejudice association makes several contributions (see also the introduction). I highlight three here: First, consistent deviations from the model‚Äôs predictions can highlight cases that warrant more in-depth investigations and suggest target groups for which perceived ideology is not enough to make accurate predictions. In the current set of target groups, prejudice toward Muslims was consistently inaccurately predicted by all seven models. Thus, for this group, it appears that accurate predictions require going beyond value dissimilarity to include additional mechanisms, such as ideological differences in associating Muslims with terrorism threats (Sides & Gross, 2013). Second, the results of this study demonstrate that researchers and practitioners can make reasonable predictions about the size and direction of the ideology-prejudice association using only a simple linear model and a group‚Äôs perceived ideology. In contrast, much of the work in social psychology makes only directional predictions‚Äîand even so the results can be replicated less often than one might expect (Open Science Collaboration, 2015; see Gilbert, King, Pettigrew, & Wilson, 2016, for a countervailing view). Third, scholars who disagree with such a simple model or believe that other theoretical processes are at play have a clear benchmark to test their own models against. My cards are on the table. Clear predictions that can be falsified will help move research forward and will lead to increasingly refined models of ideologically based prejudice._x000D_","A major shortcoming of current models of ideological prejudice is that although they can anticipate the direction of the association between participants‚Äô ideology and their prejudice against a range of target groups, they cannot predict the size of this association. I developed and tested models that can make specific size predictions for this association. A quantitative model that used the perceived ideology of the target group as the primary predictor of the ideology-prejudice relationship was developed with a representative sample of Americans (N = 4,940) and tested against models using the perceived status of and choice to belong to the target group as predictors. In four studies (total N = 2,093), ideology-prejudice associations were estimated, and these observed estimates were compared with the models‚Äô predictions. The model that was based only on perceived ideology was the most parsimonious with the smallest errors.","4",0,"4","Political",4,0

_x000D_
In highlighting the effects of the rational and emotional appeals, as compared to the no-appeal control condition, one might object that these results are simply due to ‚Äúexperimenter demand‚Äù. However, taken in context, this is not a deflationary alternative explanation. Requests for charitable donations are intended as ‚Äúdemands‚Äù ‚Äì not in the sense of being insistent or impolite, but as explicit requests for a specific behavioral response. Given that the requested behavior involves a costly risk, responding positively to the request is not trivial, as it might be in other contexts. The challenge for the present research program, then, is not to avoid making ‚Äúdemands‚Äù of our participants, but rather to determine which kinds of ‚Äúdemands‚Äù are effective, in both relative and absolute terms._x000D_
_x000D_
It is also worth noting that the inclusion of a philosophical argument in the combined appeals did not significantly dampen the effect of the emotional appeal. The rational-first combined appeal performed slightly better than the emotional appeal alone, and the emotional-first combined appeal performed slightly worse than the emotional appeal, but again, these differences were not statistically significant. By contrast, Reference Small, Loewenstein and SlovicSmall et al. (2007) found that the addition of information on the number of people in need to an emotional appeal significantly suppressed donations. This observation, along with the significant effect of the philosophical argument in the rational appeal condition, suggests that it may be worth examining differences within the broad and loosely-defined category of rational appeals._x000D_
_x000D_
We acknowledge that our distinction between ‚Äúrational‚Äù and ‚Äúemotional‚Äù appeals is a rough one and that all effective appeals are likely ‚Äì if not guaranteed‚Äîto have both rational and emotional aspects. Reference Hume, Selby-Bigge and NidditchHume (1739/1975) argued long ago that the apparent distinction between ‚Äúreason‚Äù and ‚Äúpassion‚Äù is better understood as a distinction between ‚Äúcalm‚Äù and ‚Äúviolent‚Äù passions. Likewise, the distinction between emotion and reason is a perennial target of (legitimate) criticism among psychologists (e.g., Cunningham et al. 2007; Reference Van Bavel, Xiao and CunninghamVan Bavel, Xiao & Cunningham 2012; Reference CushmanCushman, 2013; Reference Phelps, Lempert and Sokol-HessnerPhelps, Lempert & Sokol-Hessner 2014). Consistent with this view, we note that participants reported being more upset by what they read in the rational appeal condition, as compared to the control condition. Thus, for present purposes, we regard ‚Äúrational‚Äù and ‚Äúemotional‚Äù as convenient labels for familiar styles of persuasion, reflecting degrees of difference along multiple psychological dimensions. We do not take them to refer to sharply defined and wholly distinct sets of psychological processes. Further research will be required to dissociate the relevant underlying processes and their respective contributions._x000D_
_x000D_
Our results do, however, cast doubt on the standard view that appeals that are rational in this familiar sense are invariably less effective than conventionally emotional appeals in garnering charitable donations. A philosophical argument, we found, can be as effective as an emotional appeal of the kind that has led many to adopt the standard view. Of course, this is not to say that philosophical arguments will be effective in general, and again, when they do have motivational force this may be partially or entirely due to their affective influence. But some arguments, it is reasonable to think on the basis of our results, may be able to convince people to donate more, and so perhaps there is a role for rational appeals in motivating prosocial behavior after all. This work complements recent work showing that Rawlsian veil-of-ignorance reasoning can influence moral judgment, including decisions to donate to more effective causes (Reference Huang, Greene and BazermanHuang, Greene & Bazerman, 2019)._x000D_
_x000D_
There may be additional benefits to studying the impact of arguments as opposed to emotional appeals that we haven‚Äôt been able to explore in this paper. Emotional appeals would seem to work primarily on people‚Äôs immediate emotional affect, which is subject to depletion based on repeated exposure and over time. Ethical arguments, however, often aim to convince people to change their way of thinking about their own behavior and how they should treat other beings, human and non-human. When arguments succeed in changing people‚Äôs thinking, they may lead to longer term changes in behavior ‚Äì more sustained giving, changes to diet and food choices, lowering one‚Äôs carbon emissions, and so on. This is consistent with the prior points recognizing that affect may play an important role in the motivational force of ethical arguments. Further research must be conducted to examine the long-term effects of exposure to arguments on behavior and the relation of these effects to the arousal of affect, but our study provides evidence that, at least in the short term, a philosophical argument can have a significant effect in motivating prosocial behavior._x000D_
_x000D_
While some philosophers have thought that the study of morality is no different from inquiry into any other topic, others have held that moral and political concepts should be fruitful in helping us to solve problems that we face as agents interacting with other agents and non-agent sentient creatures (Lindauer forthcoming). Our work demonstrates that thinking about charitable giving in terms of duties of assistance, a positive duty, has the virtue of motivating moral action and so meets this desideratum. Insofar as the shallow pond argument motivates moral behavior, it is practically fruitful in a way that other arguments may not be, and this, according to some philosophers, should go into the evaluation of the argument, in addition to its validity and soundness. Other approaches may also be examined, such as comparing positive duty arguments with arguments that focus on negative duties or duties not to harm (Buckland et al.). While many philosophers have been committed, often implicitly, to the practical effects of their ideas and arguments mattering for their evaluation, we take a step further here and attempt to directly test the effectiveness of a particular argument. We look forward to seeing more research conducted on the practical effects of philosophical arguments, including arguments that focus on other pressing moral problems, such as climate change and the plight of refugees._x000D_
_x000D_
Despite the restrictions in the scope of our study discussed above, our findings provide insight into the factors that motivate people to address global poverty and perhaps other pressing moral issues. They will also help us to understand the range of possible forms of moral motivation, promoting a more nuanced account of the role of reason and emotion in prosocial behavior._x000D_
_x000D_
We hope that this line of research can inform the work of NGOs. As noted above, prior research has suggested that rational appeals will generally suppress the positive effects of emotional appeals, but this wasn‚Äôt the case in our study. If, as our results suggest, philosophical arguments have some motivating force of their own and need not undermine more conventionally emotional appeals, it may be wise to employ both types of persuasion, deploying them at different times, with different audiences, and with different types of goals. As the history of these ideas suggests (Reference SingerSinger, 1972, 2015), rational appeals may prove especially effective in producing long-term changes in values, attitudes, and behaviors regarding pressing moral problems.","We present evidence from a pre-registered experiment indicating that a philosophical argument ‚Äì a type of rational appeal ‚Äì can persuade people to make charitable donations. The rational appeal we used follows Singer‚Äôs ‚Äúshallow pond‚Äù argument (1972), while incorporating an evolutionary debunking argument (Paxton, Ungar and Greene, 2012) against favoring nearby victims over distant ones. The effectiveness of this rational appeal did not differ significantly from that of a well-tested emotional appeal involving an image of a single child in need (Small, Loewenstein and Slovic, 2007). This is a surprising result, given evidence that emotions are the primary drivers of moral action, a view that has been very influential in the work of development organizations. We found no support for our hypothesis that combining our rational and emotional appeals would have a stronger effect than either appeal in isolation. However, our finding that both kinds of appeal can increase charitable donations is cause for optimism, especially concerning the potential efficacy of well-designed rational appeals. We consider the significance of these findings for moral psychology, ethics, and the work of organizations aiming to alleviate severe poverty.","2",0,"2","Political",4,0

The interplay of multiple unconditioned stimuli in evaluative conditioning: A weighted averaging framework for attitude formation via stimulus co-occurrences. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 127(5), 964‚Äì985.","Attitude change due to stimulus co-occurrences (EC) is an influential effect in attitude formation. However, previous research has neglected that stimulus co-occurrences can go beyond one stimulus at a time and that multiple stimuli are present in many situations. In the current research, we proposed an information integration framework for studying EC effects from multiple simultaneously occurring USs. In 10 experiments with different designs, materials, measures, and pairing procedures, we found that EC effects from multiple USs simultaneously present follow a weighted averaging rule. This weighted averaging rule led to the following distinct patterns in EC effects: First, conditioned attitudes did not depend on whether an attitude object co-occurred with one or multiple stimuli of the same valence. Second, the EC effect of one US was strongest if no other USs were present and weakest if other negative stimuli were present. _x000D_
_x000D_
We also tested various cognitive mechanisms that might contribute to this weighted averaging pattern. First, we found that memory for a CS‚ÄìUS pairing decreases when more stimuli are simultaneously present, which did account statistically for a part of the weighted averaging pattern but not for all of it. Second, we found no changes in US valence depending on whether it was paired with other stimuli. Third, we found that US compounds are already integrated following a weighted averaging rule, and integration on CS evaluations was not incremental to the integration pattern on US compound evaluations. _x000D_
_x000D_
Overall, our studies provide a novel perspective on EC and offer various important implications for the role of stimulus co-occurrences in attitude formation, which we discuss first. Afterward, we will discuss open questions and directions for future research. _x000D_
_x000D_
EC Effects Follow Averaging _x000D_
The core implication of our research is that conditioned attitudes from multiple simultaneously present affective stimuli align well with a simple mathematical rule. Conditioned attitudes develop as if people compute the average of all USs present in a situation. As we discuss later, we find evidence that people might indeed perform some genuine mental averaging, but that other cognitive processes might also be involved that might impose further restrictions regarding the generalizability of averaging. On a purely functional level, however, we find that a simple averaging rule predicts well how conditioned attitudes emerge, outperforming a summation rule, and even a more complex summation-and-discounting rule. Furthermore, this averaging rule implies two central restrictions regarding attitude acquisition from stimulus co-occurrences in social and nonsocial environments. _x000D_
_x000D_
First, adding positive (negative) stimuli to an already positive (negative) context has no incremental effect on conditioned attitudes. This nonmonotonicity principle implies that EC effects follow a quality-over-quantity principle. It does not matter whether an attitude object co-occurs with multiple affective stimuli, but it matters how positive/negative these stimuli are. For example, it is possible that social interventions building on EC (e.g., reducing prejudice against minorities; Olson & Fazio, 2006; increasing self-esteem; Grumm et al., 2009) might not benefit from adding further positive stimuli, and adding mildly positive stimuli might even decrease their effectiveness. _x000D_
_x000D_
Second, the effect of a single stimulus co-occurrence on conditioned attitudes attenuates if other stimuli are present, especially if they are negative. This interdependence principle could have critical implications for how strong EC effects can be in real life. Whereas stimulus co-occurrences are influential in a sterile laboratory setting (Hofmann et al., 2010), a single stimulus might have negligible influence on attitude objects in a stimulus-rich environment. Indeed, a recent review concludes that there is not much research on EC effects in genuinely applied or field settings (Moran et al., 2023). EC effects might be less likely to ermerge in field settings simply because multiple affective stimuli are present, which mask the influence of one particular US of interest. At the present stage, however, our findings are restricted to standard EC procedures, and generalizability to specific field settings remains to be tested by future research. _x000D_
_x000D_
Our findings align well with previous research on impression formation (N. H. Anderson, 1967) and attitude change (N. H. Anderson, 1971), showing that complex judgments from multiple pieces of information follow a simple averaging rule. However, this also raises the question of to what extent our results can be explained by existing theories, in particular, the averaging/summation (A/S) model (C. E. Seta & Seta, 1992; J. J. Seta et al., 1991; for a review, see J. J. Seta & Seta, 2020). This model states that both averaging and summation can pertain to a judgment. However, it also predicts averaging if affective experiences vary but summation if affective experiences have the same affective intensity. In our studies, the USs for a respective valence level had very similar affective intensities, as evidenced by the normed ratings and also our findings from Experiment 5. Thus, the A/S model would predict summation in our studies, especially for compounds of multiple USs of the same valence‚Äîwhich we do not find. Future research is necessary to test why our findings diverge from the A/S model‚Äôs predictions. Potential explanations might eventually be found in the cognitive processes underlying averaging in EC, which we turn to next. _x000D_
_x000D_
Processes Underlying Information Integration in EC _x000D_
We started this article by distinguishing between averaging and summation as computational rules describing and predicting people‚Äôs conditioned attitudes and the cognitive processes contributing to these patterns. While we find clear and consistent evidence for averaging on attitude measures, some of the cognitive process measures suggest that there might also be boundary conditions for this averaging pattern and some cognitive mechanisms might also adhere to summation. _x000D_
_x000D_
Primarily, the averaging pattern (partially) relates to a central moderator of current EC theories (Gast, 2018; Stahl & Aust, 2018)‚Äî memory. The more stimuli are present, the worse people remember a specific pairing, and the smaller is the conditioning effect of the respective US. Across all experiments, we observed some evidence that this partially contributes to the averaging pattern. In particular, Experiments 7‚Äì9 showed monotonicity, consistent with summation, and interdependence, consistent with averaging, for pairings where memory is correct. This finding deserves further consideration. _x000D_
_x000D_
One interpretation is that multiple cognitive mechanisms are involved in information integration in EC, where some processes favor a summation pattern, and some processes favor an averaging pattern. The contribution from summation processes is simply masked by the decrease in memory for an increasing amount of affective stimuli. This would imply that mixtures of summation-and-averaging patterns emerge in situations where memory is highly accurate. It would also imply that the cognitive mechanisms underlying information integration in EC are more flexible and more complex than people engaging in a simple averaging or summation process. _x000D_
_x000D_
However, another interpretation is that the monotonicity effect for correct memory reflects a methodological artifact. Previous research has shown that people also rely on their attitudes toward the CS when asked about their memory (Bar-Anan & Amzaleg-David, 2014; H√ºtter et al., 2012; Ingendahl, Woitzel, et al., 2023). In our case, people might infer from a highly positive attitude that the respective attitude object co-occurred with many positive stimuli. In contrast, they might infer from a less positive attitude that the object was only shown with a few positive stimuli. Consequently, analyzing only those CS evaluations where the memory response was correct might have induced a bias favoring monotonicity simply because only the strongest conditioned attitudes led participants to infer that the CS was shown with multiple USs. Supporting this latter explanation, a re-analysis of Experiments 7‚Äì9 showed that also for pairings with incorrect memory responses, more extreme conditioned attitudes correlated with responses that the object was shown with many positive/negative USs (see additional online material Supplement G at https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/ WJZ9V). However, this interpretation also implies that people have metacognitive beliefs about some summation processes in their own attitude acquisition (i.e., ‚Äúwhat I like very much must come from a lot of positive information‚Äù), whereas our experiments show that the attitude change itself is bound to processes leading to averaging. Previous research has indeed shown that people expect summation in attitude change for receivers of a persuasive message but themselves show attitude change consistent with an averaging rule (Weaver et al., 2012). However, such differences remain to be tested in attitude formation via EC. At the present stage, we thus recommend interpreting the monotonicity effect with caution and suggest that future research should further examine the role of memory by relying on more elaborate memory measures (H√ºtter et al., 2012; Stahl et al., 2024). _x000D_
_x000D_
Beyond memory, we did not find evidence that a US‚Äôs valence changes due to the pairing with other affective stimuli. Instead, we found evidence that people already experience a compound of multiple affective stimuli following a weighted averaging rule. This finding aligns with research from other areas, showing that positive/ negative life events are experienced following an averaging rule (J. J. Seta et al., 1991, 2008; see also Fredrickson & Kahneman, 1993). However, it also raises the question under which condition such a nonadditive US compound is formed. From a Gestalt psychological perspective, one could speculate that the stimuli must have some degree of physical proximity and be similar to each other compared to the background in order to be integrated into a nonadditive average experience (Sperlich & Unkelbach, 2022; Wagemans et al., 2012). Such moderating conditions remain to be tested by future research. _x000D_
_x000D_
Differential Weighting and ‚ÄúNegativity Bias‚Äù _x000D_
Across the different experiments, we obtained evidence that negative USs receive a stronger weight in averaging than negative USs. This has critical implications for when and why a negativity bias (Rozin & Royzman, 2001; Rozin et al., 2010) can be expected in conditioning effects. Previous EC research has speculated about negativity biases in EC but obtained mixed empirical evidence (H√ºtter et al., 2012; Landwehr et al., 2017; van den Bosch et al., 2015). Here, it is important to distinguish between different manifestations of negativity bias (Rozin & Royzman, 2001), particularly negative potency and negativity dominance. Negative potency means that negative information has a stronger impact despite the same objective magnitude as positive information. Negativity dominance means that negative information receives a stronger weight when integrated with positive information. Summation and averaging make different predictions regarding the specific manifestation of negativity bias (Figure 1). Summation predicts negativity potency, with a generally stronger influence of negative USs irrespective of whether other USs are present. In contrast, averaging predicts negativity dominance, with a stronger influence of negative USs in competition with positive USs. We find support for the latter prediction, suggesting that negativity bias in EC becomes only visible once positive and negative USs compete. _x000D_
_x000D_
However, just as averaging and summation are not necessarily cognitive mechanisms, stronger weighting itself is an effect and not a cognitive mechanism. On a process level, we found even slightly weaker memory for negative USs in some studies, suggesting that memory differences cannot account for this differential weighting. Likewise, we found no evidence that negative USs make co-occurring positive USs less positive. Thus, future research might focus on the cognitive processes leading to the stronger weighting of negative USs. For example, negative information is less frequent overall in the natural environment and might thus be perceived as more diagnostic than positive information (Alves et al., 2018; Unkelbach et al., 2019). _x000D_
_x000D_
This point also raises the question of whether other factors than valence lead to differential weighting. For example, a strong connection in content between CS and US might also lead to stronger weighting (e.g., Moran et al., 2022; Till et al., 2008; Ingendahl et al., 2024); but see Alves & Imhoff, 2023). Furthermore, the propositional account on EC, stating that EC effects are driven by inferences about the relation between CS and US (De Houwer, 2018), might give rise to more complex patterns than the weighted averaging rule currently predicts. As an illustration, presume that two food brands (A and B) are paired each with two negative USs: A with a cockroach and a person vomiting, and B with a person vomiting and a destroyed forest. For A, the two USs are conceptually similar and might lead to similar effects as one of these USs alone. However, participants might also infer a more complex relation (see also Fan et al., 2021), such that the person is vomiting because the cockroach contaminated the food brand. For B, the two USs provide nonredundant information, which might lead to incremental effects compared to one US alone. However, the two USs might also be considered inconsistent because what causes vomiting is likely not related to the destroyed forest, which might also limit the conditioning effect of the two USs combined. Thus, our findings should be interpreted with caution at the present stage, and more research is necessary to investigate the mechanisms and boundary conditions of weighted averaging in EC. _x000D_
_x000D_
Limitations and Directions for Future Research _x000D_
Beyond the considerations discussed above, our research leaves several unanswered questions that should be picked up by future research. We discuss some general open questions regarding external validity and generalizability (e.g., across non-Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic samples) in Table 5. However, we also consider specific theory-based constraints regarding generalizability below. _x000D_
_x000D_
First, so far, our framework focused on situations where multiple USs are present at the same time. However, people might also average if USs are encountered across different situations (Hogarth & Einhorn, 1992). Previous research has shown EC in situations where a CS is presented with multiple USs sequentially (e.g., CS‚Äì US1, CS‚ÄìUS2, ‚Ä¶; Gawronski et al., 2015; H√ºtter et al., 2022; Stahl & Unkelbach, 2009; Sweldens et al., 2010; Vogel et al., 2021). Findings from these studies are so far alignable both with averaging and summation. In support of averaging, EC effects in these studies are comparable in size or even slightly weaker than when a CS is always presented with the same US (Stahl & Unkelbach, 2009; Sweldens et al., 2010; but see Gawronski et al., 2015). However, there is a natural confound: The overall number of pairings per US is lower in these studies. EC effects here may also be the sum of multiple smaller EC effects from each individual US. Based on our findings, we speculate that averaging is less likely compared to simultaneous US presentations because people do not encounter the USs as compounds but in isolation._x000D_
_x000D_
Second, future research should further test at which stage of the conditioning process the US information is integrated‚Äîat learning or judgment. Integration at learning implies that people first integrate the different US valences into an overall context valence. This overall context valence then exerts an EC effect on the CS. Integration at judgment means that each US has a unique conditioning effect during learning. Only when an evaluative response (e.g., a judgment or behavior) is required do people integrate the different independent conditioned valences into a single response. Our findings on US compound evaluations suggest that integration might already occur during learning, but they do not exclude integration at judgment. Such integration at judgment would imply that separate conditioned attitudes are formed, which would conflict if a CS was paired with one positive and one negative US. In other words, integration at judgment would imply that the CS is ambivalent (Thompson et al., 1995). Also, integration at judgment should be sensitive to any postconditioning changes in the valence of the USs. For example, if a neutral US becomes positive or negative after the conditioning, this can only influence integration at judgment but not at learning. _x000D_
_x000D_
Third, a key debate in EC and attitude research is the contribution of associative and propositional processes in attitude formation (Corneille & Stahl, 2019; Gawronski & Bodenhausen, 2014; H√ºtter, 2022; Moran et al., 2023). Purely propositional accounts postulate that EC is driven by inferences people make about the CS‚ÄìUS relation (De Houwer, 2018). Dual-process accounts propose that EC is partially driven by such inferences but also by associative links between CS and US that form automatically and depend only on the spatiotemporal contiguity of the stimuli (Gawronski & Bodenhausen, 2014). Associative attitude formation operates on links between memory nodes established via Hebbian learning and the principle of spreading activation (Gawronski & Bodenhausen, 2014) and might thus follow a summation rule (Betsch et al., 2006). In contrast, propositional processes can discount the validity of a CS‚Äì US link, for example, if the information is redundant. Accordingly, propositional attitude formation might follow an averaging pattern. This prediction (associative‚Äîsummation, propositional‚Äîaveraging) also aligns with earlier theories on the contribution of implicit processes to attribute formation (Betsch et al., 2001, 2004). Future research might consider investigating differences in the integration rule by using more automatic attitude measures or providing explicit information on the relation between the stimuli. _x000D_
_x000D_
Last, there might also be a dissociation between the valence and the strength of conditioned attitudes regarding the integration rule. Our previous studies show that the valence of the conditioned attitude follows a weighted averaging rule. However, persuasion research has shown that the amount of information positively relates to the attitude‚Äôs behavioral impact (Davidson, 1995) or its stability (Harkins & Petty, 1987). Accordingly, a conditioned attitude from a higher number of USs might also be more resistant to change, more predictive for behavior, or more persistent over time. _x000D_
_x000D_
Statement of Limitations _x000D_
The reported experiments have high internal validity. However, some conclusions regarding the underlying processes are inferred from correlative data and may benefit from subsequent experimental validation. The manipulations employed in this research are rooted in previous evaluative conditioning paradigms and have a high construct validity. However, the studies are restricted to explicit attitude measurements, warranting potential future exploration of more indirect and automatic measures. Furthermore, only withinsubjects designs are employed. Regarding statistical validity, frequentist ANOVAs and contrast analyses support the proposed averaging rule across all experiments. Nevertheless, the specific contrast designed for testing differential weighting of positive and negative stimuli was not significant in all single experiments. The proposed weighted averaging rule generalizes across different stimulus materials, measures, pairing procedures, and experimental designs. However, the experimental procedures are close to established EC paradigms for testing the basic processes underlying attitude formation, providing little evidence for or against external validity. Also, the participant samples consist of individuals who are Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Although the empirical phenomenon and its proposed explanation should, in theory, generalize across different cultural backgrounds, this assumption has not been explicitly tested in this line of research. _x000D_
_x000D_
Conclusion _x000D_
Our weighted averaging framework provides a novel perspective on EC and offers valuable insights into attitude formation from multiple co-occurring positive/negative stimuli. Our research also sheds light on the underlying mechanisms behind this weighted averaging rule, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of how attitudes from stimulus co-occurrences develop in more complex contexts._x000D_","Evaluative conditioning (EC) is a key effect in attitude formation, leading to changes in the liking of neutral attitude objects due to their pairing with positive or negative stimuli. Despite EC‚Äôs significance, current theories and most empirical findings are limited to stimulus pairings with a single affective stimulus at a time. In contrast, social environments often involve more complex combinations of affective stimuli. In this article, we introduce a novel framework grounded in information integration research to understand how conditioned attitudes develop in the presence of multiple affective stimuli. Through 10 experiments with different designs, measures, materials, and pairing procedures, we find that individuals‚Äô conditioned attitudes follow the average valence of all affective stimuli present with a stronger weighting of negative stimuli. This weighted averaging rule bears two implications for EC in more complex stimulus combinations. First, EC effects are nonmonotonous, such that additional stimuli of the same valence do not produce incremental EC effects. Second, EC effects are interdependent, such that the impact of one stimulus is weakest when accompanied by another negative stimulus and strongest when no other affective stimulus is present. We examine different cognitive processes underlying this weighted averaging rule, including potential differences in pairing memory or changes in the affective stimuli‚Äôs valence when other stimuli are present. Our findings present a novel theoretical perspective on EC and offer valuable insights into attitude change from stimulus co-occurrences in stimulus-rich environments.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,0

Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 127(5), 986‚Äì1011.","Across four preregistered studies, using multiple topics and measuring different beliefs, we compared evaluations of study quality between participants who made either blinded evaluations‚Äîjudging a study‚Äôs methodological merits before knowing its results‚Äîor unblinded evaluations of the same study. By pairing this novel experimental design with measurements of participants‚Äô expectations (prior efficacy beliefs in Studies 1a‚Äì2 and prior bias beliefs in Study 3) and their preferences/feelings (prior support in Studies 1a‚Äì2 and partisan feelings in Study 3), we created strict tests of partisan information processing. Comparing participants who provided blinded and unblinded evaluations allowed us to test whether unblinded partisans are impartial evaluators of politically relevant science. Furthermore, measuring partisans‚Äô expectations and preferences/feelings allowed us to test whether any observed biases supported the expectancy-driven and/or congeniality-driven accounts of partisan bias. _x000D_
_x000D_
Ultimately, we found clear and consistent evidence that partisans are not impartial evaluators of new scientific evidence, and the results supported both the expectancy-driven and congenialitydriven accounts of partisan bias. Unblinded partisans‚Äô preferences and feelings influenced their evaluations significantly more than their blinded counterparts‚Äô (Studies 1b, 2, and 3), as did unblinded partisans‚Äô expectations (Studies 1a, 2, and 3). Notably, in our more highly powered analyses (Studies 2 and 3), we found that partisans‚Äô preferences/feelings and expectations yielded distinguishable biases on their evaluations. Moreover, the effects we observed were primarily driven by unblinded partisans providing negatively biased evaluations of unexpected and uncongenial studies, consistent with findings of motivated skepticism toward undesirable beliefs and evidence (Cusimano & Lombrozo, 2021; Ditto & Lopez, 1992; Ditto et al., 1998). By using a novel experimental paradigm‚Äîblinding evaluations to establish better impartial benchmarks, deploying specific measures of quality evaluations to counter Bayesian counterexplanations, and measuring the influence of different beliefs to better test existing theoretical accounts‚Äîwe addressed the major limitations of past research. Our results thus provided the clearest evidence to date that partisans exhibit expectancy-driven and congeniality-driven biases when evaluating politically relevant scientific information. _x000D_
_x000D_
Theoretical Implications _x000D_
Toward More Integrative Theories of Biased Cognition _x000D_
In the current studies, we conducted strict tests of the congeniality-driven account of partisan bias by systematically addressing the limitations of prior research. We found that partisans‚Äô feelings and preferences biased their evaluations, above and beyond the influence of their expectations. Although it is not necessary to posit motivations to explain all instances of biased cognition (Kahneman, 2003; Oeberst & Imhoff, 2023), our findings suggest that ‚Äúmotivated‚Äù factors (i.e., preferences/feelings) may be more functionally entrenched with ‚Äúunmotivated‚Äù drivers (i.e., expectations) of belief-consistent cognition than previously recognized, at least in the political domain. Not only were partisans‚Äô preferences/feelings and expectations highly correlated across our studies (rs = 0.62‚Äì0.76), but the effects that each class of prior belief exerted on partisans‚Äô evaluations were highly intertwined. As detailed further in our additional online material (https://osf.io/ xhjk7/), models for Studies 2 and 3 that included only one class of prior beliefs (i.e., preferences/feelings or expectations) accounted for nearly the same amount of variance in partisans‚Äô evaluations as did models that included both classes of prior beliefs (i.e., preferences/feelings and expectations). In other words, while the different prior belief measures yielded independent influences, the bulk of the observed partisan biases was accounted for by their shared influence. _x000D_
_x000D_
We hope these data help resolve long-standing debates about the existence of motivated reasoning (Ditto, 2009). The support we found for the congeniality-driven account provides evidence of politically motivated reasoning as classically construed; that is, we found evidence of nonexpectancy variables as a driver of partisan bias, above and beyond the influence of partisans‚Äô expectations. The support we found for the expectancy-driven account, however, is trickier to classify. Expectations have typically been considered an ‚Äúunmotivated‚Äù influence on reasoning (Erdelyi, 1974; Gerber & Green, 1999; D. T. Miller & Ross, 1975; Oeberst & Imhoff, 2023; Tetlock & Levi, 1982; others term this an accuracy motivation, Kunda, 1990), yet recent theorists have considered biases driven by priors and expectations to be a form of directional motivated reasoning (Bayes & Druckman, 2021; Druckman & McGrath, 2019). These recent theorists argue that expectancy-driven biases reflect partisans‚Äô motivation to maintain their beliefs, rather than a motivation to form an accurate or impartial evaluation. While our data are not well-suited for resolving this theoretical and terminological dispute, it is plausible to us that expectancy-driven biases index the influence of both impartial and partial motivations (i.e., drives toward accuracy and belief maintenance may manifest through the influence of partisans‚Äô priors on their evaluations). Nevertheless, our data provide clear evidence of motivated reasoning, whether one adopts a broad conception of the phenomenon (i.e., congeniality-driven and expectancy-driven biases reflect different kinds of motivated reasoning) or a narrow conception of the phenomenon (i.e., congeniality-driven biases, but not expectancy-driven biases, reflect motivated reasoning). Research that further examines when and to what extent various motivational biases drive belief-consistent cognition will yield more fruitful descriptions of political reasoning than debates over whether such biases exist. _x000D_

Partisans Are Partial, but Are They Rational? _x000D_
Our findings may seem counterintuitive to those who have typically considered motivated reasoning to be inherently irrational. After all, how can ‚Äúirrational‚Äù motivations influence partisans in the same direction, and largely to the same extent, as their ‚Äúrational‚Äù prior beliefs? _x000D_
_x000D_
It is important to note that, while we find partisans are not impartial evaluators of new information, our results do not necessarily speak to the rationality of partisans‚Äô information processing. For decades, debates over the empirical drivers of information processing have been mired in psychologists‚Äô amateur conceptual analyses of the (ir)- rationality of those processes. Yet such normative analyses‚Äîtheorizing about how a ‚Äúrational‚Äù reasoner would evaluate information‚Äîare not necessary to operationalize or observe a bias (Oeberst & Imhoff, 2023). Empirically describing a bias (i.e., an evaluative tendency) and assessing the (ir)rationality of that bias are two separate issues (with the latter task likely being one better suited to philosophers). In the domain of politics, whether partisans are biased (a descriptive claim) is separate from whether it is rational for partisans to be biased (a normative claim). This is why Bayesian logic is fundamentally incapable of explaining away partisan biases: Such attempts aim to replace an empirical description with a normative theory, to swap an apple for an orange. _x000D_
_x000D_
Although normative theories are impotent as challenges to the existence of empirical phenomena, normative analyses have a long history of helping theorists adjudicate between explanations for empirical phenomena, as illustrated in debates over the role of motivations in information processing (Bullock, 2009; Ditto, 2009; Erdelyi, 1974; Gerber & Green, 1999; D. T. Miller & Ross, 1975; Tetlock & Levi, 1982). In the case of political cognition specifically, Bayesian logic has helped researchers identify and address holes in motivated reasoning accounts of partisan bias (Druckman & McGrath, 2019; Tappin et al., 2020b). Until the present studies, partisans‚Äô reliance on their priors when evaluating new information was a plausible counterexplanation for the influence of partisans‚Äô feelings and preferences. However, we found that unblinded partisans‚Äô feelings and preferences, as well as their expectations, drove their quality evaluations to deviate from the impartial baselines established by their blinded counterparts. By teasing apart the normative claims (i.e., how partisans ‚Äúshould‚Äù reason) and descriptive claims (i.e., how partisans actually reason) of prior research, we devised more rigorous tests of how various beliefs influence political cognition, resulting in support for theoretical accounts that have been traditionally presented as competing hypotheses (Ditto et al., in press). _x000D_
_x000D_
We argue that teasing apart the historical conflation between bias and irrationality helps reveal a deeper truth about ‚Äúrational‚Äù cognition. Namely, it clarifies how it may be rational, at certain levels of analysis, to be biased. In environments where any individual‚Äôs beliefs and behaviors will have a limited impact on political systems, it may be rational (i.e., sociofunctional) to express group- or identity-consistent beliefs even at the expense of accuracy or impartiality (Kahan, 2016; Pinsof et al., 2023). Where the costs of inaccuracy, incoherence, and partiality are limited, it can be ‚Äúecologically rational‚Äù and adaptive to exhibit perceptual and evaluative biases (Arkes et al., 2016). Indeed, in their fervor to classify the epistemic (ir)rationality of biases, researchers have generally overlooked the ‚Äúdeep,‚Äù evolutionary rationality that may underlie these evaluative tendencies (Barlev & Neuberg, 2024). Recognizing the compatibility between motivated biases and certain types of rationality may help researchers develop more integrative theoretical frameworks for explaining the ubiquity of belief-consistent biases in human cognition (e.g., Oeberst & Imhoff, 2023). _x000D_
_x000D_
Symmetries in Partisan Bias _x000D_
If partisan biases flow from an ecological or evolutionary rationality, then we should be skeptical of accounts of political cognition that suggest there is greater between-group variance than within-group variance in partisan bias. This is especially true for groups that live in similar ecologies and have undergone similar evolutionary pressures. In other words, we do not think that liberals and conservatives are separate species. As such, we are not surprised by evidence that liberals and conservatives largely display biases to a similar degree (Ditto, Liu, et al., 2019; Guay & Johnston, 2022; Washburn & Skitka, 2018), such as in our Study 3. _x000D_
_x000D_
However, our studies were not designed to conclusively answer questions of partisan (a)symmetries (see Table 4 for further limitations), and we did observe a statistically significant asymmetry in expectancy-driven biases (but not in congeniality-driven biases) in Study 3. While we caution against interpreting this result as meaningful support for a partisan asymmetry (given the p value observed for this test; see Lakens & Evers, 2014), we do not suggest that partisan biases will always be symmetrical. In fact, it is nearly certain that there will be substantial heterogeneity in the magnitude of partisan biases observed across samples and political topics (Yarkoni, 2022) and the extent to which such biases are expectancy- or congeniality-driven. Following Oeberst and Imhoff (2023), we take prior beliefs and belief-consistent information processing to be the recipe for any bias; what differs across biases is the specific belief that is the psychologically active ingredient. When liberals have stronger beliefs or preferences about a topic than conservatives, and vice versa (Skitka et al., 2015), asymmetrical biases will likely emerge. Nevertheless, while liberals may be more biased about certain topics and conservatives may be more biased about others, we suspect that partisan biases will generally be symmetrical. If liberals and conservatives generally hold mirrored versions of the same beliefs and preferences (such as believing something is true/ false, or being in support/opposition to a group or political candidate), then they will demonstrate symmetrical biases when such beliefs and preferences are made salient. Ultimately, our results suggest an important ideological symmetry: Both liberals and conservatives will deflate the evidentiary value of information that is perceived to challenge their preferences, identities, ingroups, or prior beliefs. The blinding paradigm allows for more precise estimates of the magnitude of partisan biases, and pairing the blinding paradigm with separate measurements of priors and preferences will help future researchers provide more definitive answers to questions of ideological (a)symmetries in bias (Ditto et al., in press)._x000D_
_x000D_
Moderators of Partisan Bias _x000D_
Moreover, we surmise that it will be difficult to find individual differences that consistently moderate partisan biases across evaluative contexts. Consider differences in cognitive reflection, which have been posited to both exacerbate political biases (Kahan et al., 2017) and ameliorate them (Tappin et al., 2020a, 2021). In the present work, we found that cognitive reflection slightly exacerbated partisan biases in Study 2 but did not significantly moderate partisan biases in Study 3. Similarly, moral conviction did not moderate partisan bias in Study 2, and intellectual humility did not moderate partisan biases in Study 3. Although we were surprised by the lack of moderation by these individual difference measures, these null findings accord with theorizing about the likely domain-general moderators of biased cognition: Unless an individual difference consistently alters partisans‚Äô belief strength or their propensity to engage in belief-consistent information processing, it will not be able to explain much variation in partisans‚Äô evaluative tendencies (Oeberst & Imhoff, 2023). _x000D_
_x000D_
Consistent with this theory, we found that partisans‚Äô confidence in their prior beliefs about partisan bias strongly amplified the expectancy-driven effects observed in Study 3. Partisans who were more confident that their political opponents are more biased than their political allies displayed significantly stronger biases than their less-confident counterparts. This finding aligns with work on more general myside biases, in which belief strength is a robust predictor of such effects (Stanovich & Toplak, 2022; Stanovich & West, 2008). Strength of partisan affiliation, which relates to the propensity to engage in belief-consistent cognition (Van Bavel & Pereira, 2018), amplified partisan biases in Study 3 as well. Importantly, all the individual difference analyses in the present work were exploratory, so our studies should be directly and conceptually replicated to ensure the generalizability of these results. Nevertheless, given the consistency of these results with theorizing about belief-consistent biases (Oeberst & Imhoff, 2023), and myside biases specifically, we believe this framework will help researchers better identify domain-general moderators of partisan biases. _x000D_

Practical Implications _x000D_
Blinding and the Prevention of Partisan Bias _x000D_
The present studies are predicated on a simple but powerful logic: When evaluators are not aware of decision-irrelevant criteria, such criteria cannot bias their evaluations (Ebersole, 2019; Wilson & Brekke, 1994). Blinded participants provided impartial evaluations of the presented studies, which served as impartial benchmarks against which to compare unblinded participants‚Äô evaluations. While blinding primarily served as a methodological tool to help us better identify partisan biases, our experiments also provided further evidence of the utility of blinding to prevent evaluative biases (Goldin & Rouse, 2000; Schulz et al., 1995; Uhlmann & Cohen, 2005). _x000D_
_x000D_
Blinding should be considered a useful tool for psychologists to wield in service of ‚Äúgiving debiasing away‚Äù (Lilienfeld et al., 2009). People need help avoiding closed cognitive loops, where only data that affirm their desires and expectations are deemed valid (Ditto, Clark, et al., 2019). This is especially important at the intersection of science and politics, where such loops stifle effective consensusbuilding and policymaking (Druckman, 2017; Finkel et al., 2020). Nevertheless, while our results support the notion that blinding is a viable debiasing tool, there were also limitations to the impact of blinding in our studies. First, while blinding did reduce the influence of partisans‚Äô prior beliefs on some of their downstream judgments (i.e., credibility impressions), these effects were inconsistent and much smaller than the debiasing impact of blinding on partisans‚Äô initial quality evaluations. Second, blinding had a minimal impact on the extent to which partisans updated their beliefs in response to the presented information. Although not as conclusively reflective of biased reasoning as our primary analyses of quality evaluations, these results align with previous observations of the ‚Äúwhack-amole‚Äù nature of bias, where biases blocked at one location resurface further down the information processing stream (Khanna & Sood, 2018). _x000D_
_x000D_
It is worth remarking on the seemingly Sisyphean nature of the debiasing enterprise. Preventing evaluative biases early in information processing, via blinding or other techniques, will not necessarily prevent biases in later processes, such as belief updating (Thaler, 2023). If belief-consistent biases are indeed a feature of human cognition (Oeberst & Imhoff, 2023), then we should expect our usual, one-shot attempts to thwart such biases to fall short of our ultimate debiasing goals. We do not mean to trivialize the impact that one-shot interventions can have: Any increase in Republicans‚Äô COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, for instance, may have saved lives once those vaccines were made widely available (Wallace et al., 2023). Rather, we argue that, despite the positive impacts of one-shot interventions, partisans will not consistently transcend humans‚Äô widespread evaluative tendencies toward belief consistency without sustained cultural practices or salient social incentives that counter those tendencies. _x000D_
_x000D_
The Metascience of Partisan Bias _x000D_
While we have focused on lay evaluations of scientific evidence, we believe our findings and discussion are relevant to experts‚Äô social cognition as well. Specifically, we do not think there has been sufficient attention paid to the ways that researchers‚Äô evaluative biases, including partisan biases, can impact scientific literatures. Researchers do not often agree on the quality of research even in the absence of politics; for example, evaluations of NIH grant proposals are better predicted by the idiosyncratic preferences of reviewers than by the number of weaknesses identified by those reviewers in a particular proposal (Pier et al., 2018). Moreover, single-blind review processes, where reviewers know who authored a submitted article, generally result in more favorable outcomes for prominent researchers and less favorable outcomes for unknown researchers (Huber et al., 2022). Given this highly subjective peer-review process, it is plausible that scientists evaluate research that runs counter to their theoretical or political commitments more skeptically than research that affirms those commitments, distorting the landscape of published research on contentious topics. As is the case with other varieties of evaluative bias, modest effects at the individual level can aggregate into large effects at the collective level (Funder & Ozer, 2019; Hardy et al., 2022). Evaluative competence and domain-area expertise may mitigate partisan biases, yet such expertise may instill self-perceptions of objectivity that, as has been shown in lay evaluations (Uhlmann & Cohen, 2007), could undermine experts‚Äô evaluations._x000D_
_x000D_
We do not know of research that has examined how scientists‚Äô political beliefs may influence their methodological evaluations of politically relevant research. Yet, as has been noted, ‚ÄúIt would be remarkable indeed if scientists were immune to the empirical phenomena we study‚Äù (Uhlmann, 2011, p. 214). For instance, by their own admission, some researchers find it ‚Äúreasonable and appropriate for people to ask whether the study‚Äôs conclusions agree with their preexisting beliefs‚Äù when evaluating its methodological quality (Baron & Jost, 2019, p. 297). Such filtering of methodological evaluations through one‚Äôs prior beliefs mirrors the evaluative process that resulted in our unblinded participants‚Äô biases. Beyond illustrating that differences between lay and expert evaluations are often differences in degree rather than kind (Ballantyne et al., 2022, p. 13), this admission suggests that social and political psychologists may need to improve their peer-review processes to ensure that partisan biases do not impede scientific discovery. _x000D_
_x000D_
Leaning further into the logic of blinding may help psychologists further debias their work, which will be necessary to enhance the reliability and credibility of psychological research (Vazire et al., 2022). Crucially, blinding techniques are equalopportunity bias prevention: Blinding strategies can help reduce conservative biases in one journal or subfield while similar procedures can help reduce prevailing liberal biases in a different subfield. Simply engaging in more double-blind (vs. single-blind) review processes may reduce some evaluative biases (Huber et al., 2022), yet only blinding to author identity and affiliation may not be sufficient for combating biases related to the politicalcongeniality of a given set of findings (Ballantyne & Celniker, 2024). The greater use of registered reports (Chambers et al., 2015; Munaf√≤ et al., 2017; Nosek & Lakens, 2014), as well as creating results-blind review processes for nonregistered reports (Button et al., 2016), may be necessary to reliably increase impartiality in peer review. Broader adoption of such practices can help scientists mitigate partisan and other evaluative biases (e.g., biases toward supporting hypothesized effects) that may underlie publication biases in some fields (Barto≈° et al., 2022). Blinding cannot fix all that ails psychology, but further preventing scientists‚Äô own biases from influencing the literature is a necessary step toward improving psychological science. _x000D_
_x000D_
It may be worth investigating the extent to which scientists‚Äô biases influence their empirical evaluations before pursuing further blinding reforms in earnest. Yet given the widespread prevalence of belief-consistent biases (Oeberst & Imhoff, 2023) and the fact that such biases are not reliably dampened by cognitive sophistication (Batailler et al., 2022; Stanovich & Toplak, 2022), we suggest it is worth proactively investing in such reforms. Lay individuals claim to be objective after knowingly using biased evaluative strategies (Hansen et al., 2014) and do not generally choose to blind themselves from potentially biasing information when the opportunity is available to them (Fath et al., 2022); as experts of social cognition, we should develop psychologically ‚Äúwise‚Äù review processes to avoid mirroring these mistakes (Pronin & Hazel, 2023). _x000D_
_x000D_
Summary _x000D_
Despite decades of research, there has not been an established consensus about (a) whether partisans engage in biased social cognition and (b) whether any such biased cognition reflects motivated reasoning. We systematically addressed the limitations of past research on partisan bias to help resolve these debates. Across four studies, we found clear evidence that partisans engage in biased social cognition and that their evaluations of politically relevant science were susceptible to both expectancy-driven and congeniality-driven partisan biases, both of which can be construed as reflecting motivated reasoning. What partisans believed and wanted to be true inhibited them from evaluating evidence impartially, and their ‚Äúpriors‚Äù and desires were functionally intertwined in producing these biases. Furthermore, in a study designed to test for (a)symmetries in partisan biases (Study 3), we found that liberals and conservatives displayed similar levels of partisan bias. _x000D_
_x000D_
In considering the ubiquity of biased social cognition, we hope that researchers will appreciate the need for more robust, institutional interventions to combat partisan biases. We also suggest that psychologists are not immune to the biases we investigate, including those revealed in the present studies. Further embracing the logic of blinding may help psychologists develop better approaches to combating partisan biases, both within and beyond social science._x000D_","Despite decades of research, it has been difficult to resolve debates about the existence and nature of partisan bias‚Äîthe tendency to evaluate information more positively when it supports, rather than challenges, one‚Äôs political views. Whether partisans display partisan biases, and whether any such biases reflect motivated reasoning, remains contested. We conducted four studies (total N = 4,010) in which participants who made unblinded evaluations of politically relevant science were compared to participants who made blinded evaluations of the same study. The blinded evaluations‚Äîjudgments of a study‚Äôs quality given before knowing whether its results were politically congenial‚Äîserved as impartial benchmarks against which unblinded participants‚Äô potentially biased evaluations were compared. We also modeled the influence of partisans‚Äô preferences and prior beliefs to test accounts of partisan judgment more stringently than past research. Across our studies, we found evidence of politically motivated reasoning, as unblinded partisans‚Äô preferences and prior beliefs independently biased their evaluations. We contend that conceptual confusion between descriptive and normative (e.g., Bayesian) models of political cognition has impeded the resolution of long-standing theoretical debates, and we discuss how our results may help advance more integrative theorizing. We also consider how the blinding paradigm can help researchers address further theoretical disputes (e.g., whether liberals and conservatives are similarly biased), and we discuss the implications of our results for addressing partisan biases within and beyond social science.","4",0,"4","Political",4,1
77,13,"Bai, H., & Zhao, X. (2024). Asian = machine, Black = animal? The racial asymmetry of dehumanization. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 127(5), 1038‚Äì1061.","The tendency to dehumanize racial minority groups has captured researchers‚Äô attention in past studies, but the popular operational focus on animalistic dehumanization has belied the complexity of how different racial groups are dehumanized differently. This lacuna in the literature prompted assumptions that Asian people, as ‚Äúmodel minorities‚Äù (Chou & Feagin, 2015), are relatively immune to dehumanization (as discussed in detail in the Introduction section). We proposed and found evidence for a racial asymmetry of dehumanization through fifteen hypotheses such that Asian people are primarily mechanically dehumanized and Black people are primarily animalistically dehumanized (again, see Table 2 for the hypotheses, which we shall not review more in detail for brevity). _x000D_
_x000D_
Our studies interrogate the proposed asymmetry from the perspective of victims (Studies 1a and 1b) as well as perceivers (Studies 2a‚Äì2d), demonstrating the asymmetry‚Äôs existence in the lab (Studies 1‚Äì2, 4a‚Äì4c, and 6) as well as in the real world (Studies 3 and 5). The studies feature a variety of sources of data (including online samples, large word embeddings, and national occupation data) and methodologies (including experiments, archival analysis, and computational methods).20 We tested the asymmetry through perceivers‚Äô general perceptions (Studies 2a‚Äì2d) as well as specific evaluations in consequential domains (Studies 4a‚Äì4c and 6) of Asian and Black people. The implications of the asymmetry span from the dating market and criminal justice system to the workplace and labor market. We acknowledge that each study has its own shortcomings in different ways, which are inevitably impractical to enumerate exhaustively across all twelve studies. However, throughout the studies, we tested the theory of asymmetry repeatedly using as many different methods as we feasibly could, and the limitation of any one study usually can be addressed by at least one other. For example, though the animalistic and mechanical dehumanization measures in Studies 2c and 2d primarily focus on comparisons with great apes and computerized machines, the corresponding measures in all other studies are reflective of the constructs‚Äô relatedness to animals and machines generally. Overall, the evidence for the claim that Asian and Black people face dehumanization differently is preponderant and expansive, and the patterns we capture are likely robust. _x000D_
_x000D_
Though our studies focus on White participants‚Äô perceptions, we also found that most of the hypothesized patterns generalized to non-White participants. These results reveal that Asian and Black people‚Äôs different experiences of dehumanization are not something uniquely perpetuated from the dominant group to the minority group. Instead, it flows ‚Äúin the air‚Äù as shared sociocultural assumptions and notorious practices (Adams et al., 2008; Steele, 1997). Our findings suggest that different racial minority groups are differentially selected and segregated along occupations that vary along the two senses of humanness. This racial division of labor may further confirm and reinforce racial dehumanization (Eagly & Wood, 2012), creating a vicious circle of racial segregation in the workforce. _x000D_
_x000D_
Contributions _x000D_
The current studies introduce a theory of racial asymmetry that clarifies how different racial groups are stigmatized differently in society. In the prevailing approach to understanding racial minorities‚Äô experience of dehumanization, researchers primarily focus on the animalistic sense of dehumanization (see above; also see Smith, 2023, for a critique on the existing social psychological model of dehumanization in capturing the construct generally). This has led to findings suggesting that Asian people do not face very much blatant dehumanization (see the Introduction section). Despite the positive light of the ‚Äúmodel minority‚Äù myth that Asian people are often cast under, our theory of asymmetry uncovers mechanical dehumanization as an overlooked domain of stigmatization that Asian people are vulnerable to, hidden in plain sight. Due to the unique combination of cultural stereotypes they face, different racial groups, while humanized in one form, are dehumanized in another. _x000D_
_x000D_
More generally, our theory of asymmetry contributes to the literature by providing a more general framework that can explain how Black people and Asian people experience stigma. Critically, though research on Asian people‚Äôs experiences has revealed many seemingly unrelated domains where they are perceived as inadequate, a general framework that can unite these findings remains missing. As discussed earlier, recent work reveals that Asian people often struggle to obtain leadership positions‚Äîhitting a ‚Äúbamboo ceiling‚Äù because they are seen as lacking essential skills for leadership, including assertiveness and interpersonal skills (Lu, 2023; Lu et al., 2022). In creative domains such as performance art, Asian people remain severely underrepresented (Ramo¬¥n et al., 2023)‚Äîindeed, it was not until 2023, more than 5 years after we initially set out to study the asymmetry phenomenon, that the first Asian woman finally won an Academy Award (Lai, 2023). _x000D_
_x000D_
The current findings unify these discrete findings about perceptions of Asian people by revealing human nature‚Äîmechanical dehumanization as a general dimension of attributes along which Asian people are often stigmatized. The current research also contributes to the literature with its practical implications for interventions about prejudice reduction. To combat these widely held prejudices, researchers who are interested in designing prejudice-reduction intervention programs should consider that different racial groups, in particular Black and Asian people, are primarily facing different types of dehumanization. For instance, interventions that increase intergroup contact (Pettigrew, 1998) and construct a common ingroup identity (Gaertner & Dovidio, 2014) are useful in reducing prejudice against the outgroup. Current studies suggest that interventions that increase the commonality in emotion and empathy during contact (Sesko & Biernat, 2010) may be especially useful for reducing prejudice against Asian people or other social groups that primarily face mechanical dehumanization. In contrast, interventions that focus on the mechanism of increasing the commonality in cultural achievement and moral sensibility may be especially useful for reducing prejudice against Black people or other social groups that face animalistic dehumanization. _x000D_
_x000D_
Our work also makes a key methodological contribution. As part of our effort in operationalization, we also developed a mechanical dehumanization scale (Studies 2c and 2d) that we validated by demonstrating its ability to capture meaningful variances and correlate with other outcome variables in the expected ways. This measure complements the N. Kteily et al. (2015) animalistic dehumanization scale‚Äîwhich asks participants where participants believe a social group is at the evolutionary stage‚Äîin the operationalization of the two forms of dehumanization for future researchers. _x000D_
_x000D_
Limitations _x000D_
The current article, by topic, focuses on the American context. As such, a key limitation of the current research is its exclusive focus on the United States in the contemporary era, and it remains unclear how well it generalizes to other national, cultural, or historical contexts. The way a stigmatized group (whether it is a racial, religious, or any sociocultural group) is diminished in a culture likely reflects the unique sociological context, the features that the group might have, the type of threats they may be perceived to impose on the individuals that engage in the dehumanization, as well as the vocabulary and analogies available to them (e.g., Esses, 2021; Haslam, 2006; Stephan et al., 2016). For example, contrasting the patterns highlighted in the current research, Chinese mainlanders, a relatively low-status group, were compared to locusts by Hongkongers when Hong Kong faced an influx of mainland Chinese migrants and tourists (e.g., Sala, 2017), suggesting that even within a racial group, the way different groups are dehumanized could be different. Therefore, within the United States, it may also be possible that the changing power relationship between various groups (e.g., see Bai & Federico, 2021; Craig & Richeson, 2014) and major historical events (e.g., Landry et al., 2022; Markowitz et al., 2021) can disrupt the patterns we observed in the current studies. Future research could specifically address these possibilities. Nevertheless, despite these contextual limitations, the current article‚Äôs contention that Asian and Black people (at least in the United States) often face different types of dehumanization remains applicable. Understanding exactly what types of sociological contexts create what types of dehumanization and investigating how they do so from both the societal level and individual levels are some interesting future directions of research. For example, researchers may investigate how historical events, such as the exploitation of early Chinese migrant workers in railroad construction, are related to mechanical dehumanization in context. _x000D_
_x000D_
Future Directions _x000D_
One future direction is to further test the current theory‚Äôs applicability to various groups within the Asian population. As recent research suggests, in many people‚Äôs minds, the prototype of Asian people is often East Asian people in particular (Goh et al., 2023; J. Lee & Ramakrishnan, 2020; though see Goh & McCue, 2021, that this pattern is more pronounced in the United States and attenuated in the United Kingdom), and the distinctions between South Asian and East Asian population have been largely overlooked until recently (e.g., Lu et al., 2020). The asymmetry may attenuate if South Asian targets are considered in the studies, given that they are not perceived as prototypically Asian as East Asian people are perceived to be. Beyond South and East Asian populations, Southeast Asian populations may require additional attention from future research‚Äî observing from existing cultural references or slurs that may be used on them (e.g., ‚Äújungle Asian‚Äù; Tomas, 2022); it is very possible that Southeast Asian people suffer from both a high level of mechanical dehumanization as well as a high level of animalistic dehumanization. Future research should consider the diversity within the Asian population to gain a more complete picture of the racial prejudice Asian people experience. _x000D_
_x000D_
Another future direction is to consider the dehumanization of racial minorities and its interface with gender or test the current theory through an intersectional lens (Lei et al., 2023). For example, women often experience sexual objectification in various ways (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997). How are mechanical and animalistic dehumanization related to objectification? Though Haslam (2006) originally theorized women‚Äôs experiences of objectification to be more related to mechanical dehumanization than animalistic dehumanization, is it possible that Asian women are nonetheless objectified in ways that are more mechanical while Black women are objectified in ways that are more animalistic? Additionally, recent studies suggest that race itself is gendered, such that Black people are seen as more masculine and Asian people as more feminine (Galinsky et al., 2013; Hall et al., 2015). How might the ‚Äúgender‚Äù of each race, and related to this, the gender of perceivers, play a role? Future research should consider further exploring these questions. For example, future research could consider addressing this question by replicating Study 4a with a larger sample size with sufficient women and men to explore how gender might interact with race in the way racial minorities are dehumanized. _x000D_
_x000D_
Investigating the asymmetry in the implicit domain of attitude is another direction of future research. Past research suggests that finegrained distinctions between valence and stereotypes on explicit attitudes do not always manifest in the implicit domain of attitudes (Kurdi et al., 2019). It could be worthwhile to investigate, for example, whether implicit mechanical dehumanization of Asian people and implicit animalistic dehumanization of Black people are more powerful predictors of attitudes toward each of the racial groups. _x000D_
_x000D_
Finally, past studies revealed that minorities who perceive that they are dehumanized tend to be more supportive of violent collective action and less willing to assist counterterrorism efforts (N. Kteily & Bruneau, 2017). In light of the current findings, it is possible that the two forms of dehumanization are differentially associated with these political tendencies for Black and Asian people, and future studies should consider empirically answering this question. _x000D_
_x000D_
Conclusion _x000D_
In conclusion, we show that animalistic dehumanization and mechanical dehumanization are experienced by Black and Asian people differently in an asymmetry: Whereas Black people are more often subjected to animalistic dehumanization, Asian people are predominantly subjected to mechanistic dehumanization._x000D_","How different racial minorities experience racism differently remains underexplored in existing research. Here, we show that Asian and Black people are often dehumanized differently. Twelve studies spotlight a racial asymmetry in dehumanization using a wide array of methods (experimental, archival, and computational) and data sources (online samples, word embeddings, and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data): Whereas Black people are more often subjected to animalistic dehumanization, Asian people are predominantly subjected to mechanistic dehumanization. We demonstrate this asymmetry from the vantage point of victims (Studies 1a and 1b) and perpetrators (Studies 2a‚Äì2d). We further document the prevalence of this asymmetry across diverse domains, from everyday language (Study 3) to perceptions in the realms of romantic relationships (Study 4a), crime rates (Study 4b), and business skills (Study 4c). Finally, we demonstrate the asymmetry‚Äôs real-world consequences in labor market segregation (Studies 5 and 6). Our findings shed light on the distinct experiences of racism encountered by different racial groups and, more critically, introduce a framework that unifies and integrates scattered empirical observations on perceptions of Asian people.","1",0,"1","Political",2,0

Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 127(4), 731‚Äì757.","In her analysis of White working-class Americans, Joan Williams asserts, ‚Äúwhen you leave the two-thirds of Americans without college degrees out of your vision of the good life, they notice‚Äù (Williams, 2017, p. 129). The current set of studies found empirical support for this claim and provided evidence for one potential source of this disparity: When it comes to feeling that you have made a contribution to your community or society, caring for a family member does not equal volunteering to help a stranger. First, using multiple methods, the current research found that Americans in lower, compared to higher, social class contexts continue to report reduced perceived social contribution. This is an enduring social class disparity that also extends to metaperceptions. Second, probing one potential source of the disparity, two experiments and a correlation study found that bridging help to distant others was perceived as more of a contribution to society than bonding help to close others, in part, because bridging help reflects greater perceived choice to help. Third, Study 5 found that differences in engaging in forms of bridging and bonding help were related to the social class disparity in perceived contributions. Taken together, the current research provides support for the hypothesis that the forms of help more accessible and common in higher (vs. lower) social class contexts are perceived as more of a contribution to society._x000D_
_x000D_
Theoretical Contributions_x000D_
This initial series of studies makes three distinct contributions to the literature on social class inequality, status hierarchy, and prosocial behavior. First, they add to theory on the psychological consequences of inequality and expand the growing list of the consequences of social class inequality. We found evidence that in addition to having fewer material resources, less well-paid jobs, and other forms of inequality, lower social class standing can be accompanied by being less likely to believe that one‚Äôs life and everyday activities provide something of value to society and the sense that others‚Äô likely share this perception. We suggest here that this aspect of psychological inequality can compound the inequality of material resources. A focus on material needs often positions psychological needs (e.g., meaning, respect, recognition, dignity) as secondary, though lower income individuals tend to view material and psychological needs as equally important (Schroeder & Epley, 2020; Thomas et al., 2020). Thus, attending to the psychological inequality faced by those in lower social class contexts is important in addition to much-needed efforts to address material-based inequalities. Further, believing one makes a meaningful contribution is important for well-being and health, even being associated with reduced risk for mortality, as well as for one‚Äôs sense of belonging (Gruenewald et al., 2012; Keyes, 1998; Muragishi et al., 2024). Thus, a consistent, robust disparity in perceived contributions may play a role in exacerbating existing social class disparities across a variety of domains._x000D_
_x000D_
Second, the current research identifies in the U.S. American context a default model of social good which emphasizes bridging help to distant others rather than bonding help to close others as a possible source of this disparity. The capacity and opportunity to fulfill the standards set by the default model of social good have the potential to add to the accumulation of advantage experienced by those with more material resources and status and could aid in fostering a sense of contributing less among those who may necessarily contribute to others in ways that differ from the default model. People with more than sufficient material resources are more likely to navigate contexts in which the needs of close others in their networks are already met without their active participation and are thus best positioned to engage in bridging help (Rossi, 2001a)._x000D_
_x000D_
The default model of social good may serve as an additional means of maintaining, reinforcing, and legitimizing the status hierarchy by conferring additional status to people in society who already have relatively more material resources, power, and influence. Further, the default model fails to fully recognize the family-oriented, private labor that is disproportionately more common and maintains community in lower (vs. higher) social class contexts. A sense of being valued in society has many sources and is the focus of multiple, often disparate literatures. It accrues, for example, through the cultural capital associated with one‚Äôs family, paid labor, education, occupation, race, gender, and social class (for a recent conceptual and empirical overview, see Ridgeway, 2019; Ridgeway & Markus, 2022). The current article investigated one potential link between helping others and the sense of feeling like a valued, contributing member of society. In doing so, we identified and analyzed an additional and relatively unexplored avenue through which social class status is recognized and maintained._x000D_
_x000D_
Third, the studies underscore the need to connect analyses of prosocial behavior, which often focus almost exclusively on helping strangers, to the growing literature on giving, as opposed to receiving, social support. Prosocial behavior is often broadly defined as ‚Äúactions intended to benefit others‚Äù (Kassin et al., 2016, p. 412) but is most often operationalized as helping a stranger and other forms of bridging help. When help between close others is considered, as is the case with the literature on social support, the focus is often on the health and well-being benefits accrued by those receiving support and not on how support or help giving can serve as a form of moral action worthy of societal respect (Inagaki & Orehek, 2017; with a few notable exceptions, e.g., Brown et al., 2003; Liang et al., 2001)._x000D_
_x000D_
The current prevalence and growing need of caring for close others suggests the rich potential for enhancing the measurement, relevance, and applicability of theories of prosociality to consider more and diverse forms of social support and how they could be recognized as moral and worthy of respect. Recent surveys in the United States that focus on the aging American population (e.g., National Public Radio, 2023) refer to ‚Äúa crisis of care‚Äù and suggest that meeting the mounting need for hands-on care may require increasing the value and moral significance of those who spend their time and much of their lives caring for close others. In many respects, a concern with how behaviors that are more common in lower social class contexts are not fully recognized reprises the classic debate between Gilligan and Kohlberg over different forms of morality. Gilligan observed that much of the work done for others such as caring and doing for others was overlooked in the analysis of moral behavior and typically undervalued because this type of work was performed in roles traditionally held by women (Gilligan, 1993; Kohlberg et al., 1983). The current work builds on this tradition by investigating the undervaluation of the types of help more accessible and common among the majority of the U.S. population (i.e., in lower social class contexts)._x000D_
_x000D_
Limitations and Future Directions_x000D_
These initial studies on the social class disparity in social contribution have important limitations. While Studies 2‚Äì4 provided evidence for the hypothesized default model, only Study 5‚Äôs analyses connected feelings of contribution to participants‚Äô helping behavior and this study did not directly measure the default model of social good. Future work could assess a more immediate connection between people‚Äôs helping behaviors and their overall sense of contributing to provide a closer test of the theory which could also help elucidate factors that shore up or instead counter the default model. Further, the experimental designs in Studies 2‚Äì3 identified a causal pathway between bridging and bonding help and others‚Äô perceptions of that help as a contribution. However, the correlational nature of Studies 4 and 5 leaves open questions of causality between how people value help and their own perceptions of whether they generally contribute to society. It is likely that connections between perceptions of help and how much one contributes are bidirectional, and it is possible that bridging help is perceived as more of a contribution to society than bonding help as a way to justify patterns of differential helping or one‚Äôs higher status in society. Given that volunteering has been considered a form of status differentiation, it is likely that perceptions of how much help contributes to society can serve both as a means to maintain and also justify status hierarchies (Smith, 1994; Wilson, 2000). One way to address these questions in future work is to manipulate the default model of social good by, for example, reframing help to one‚Äôs family as an equally important contribution as helping a stranger. Such a study could help determine whether the default model has a causal link to people‚Äôs perceptions of how much they contribute to society._x000D_
_x000D_
Further, ways of helping others vary on many dimensions and the current set of studies systematically investigated only one factor (i.e., the recipient of help) among a specific way of helping (i.e., only time spent helping another person). The experiments show meaningful differences in the perception of help to distant versus close others while holding many variables constant, including the form, consistency, and duration spent helping others. Yet, future work can further investigate whether varying help along more dimensions affects the perceived contribution of such help. Specifically, considering help to nonhuman recipients, such as helping the environment (e.g., picking up trash, recycling), or groups of recipients versus specific individuals may provide insight into how dimensions of a recipient impact the perceived contribution of the action (Slovic, 2007; Small & Loewenstein, 2003). Another common form of helping is through giving money, which is much more accessible for people in higher (vs. lower) social class contexts and ripe for further investigation (Macchia & Whillans, 2021; Meer & Priday, 2021). In addition to potentially serving as a justification for status, the default model of social good may reflect well-documented American notions of deservingness and of self-reliance. A reticence to credit help to close others as a valued contribution likely reflects a feeling that people who need assistance in older age should have taken better care of themselves or have purchased insurance to cover their care needs (Laenen & Roosma, 2022)._x000D_
_x000D_
Another important limitation of the current investigation is that the studies controlled for race and gender but did not systematically investigate their role.22 A focus on intersectionality and providing a full treatment of race and gender is necessary to fully answer the questions raised in the current studies. As an example, Americans of Color tend to engage in high rates of bonding help and community building regardless of their social class but may also face the stigmatizing perceptions that they contribute less to society than their White counterparts (Devine & Elliot, 1995; Hughes, 2001). Furthermore, bonding help is particularly prevalent among women whose caretaking roles require interdependent ways of being (AARP & National Alliance for Caregiving, 2020). However, women, on average, volunteer more than men do, suggesting that women may engage in both bridging and bonding forms of help (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016). Future work investigating the intersection of social class contexts with race and gender is critical to providing a more nuanced understanding of sociocultural variation in prosocial behavior._x000D_
_x000D_
Future work also stands to investigate social class, ways of helping, and perceptions of contributing outside of the U.S. national context. Whether the findings presented in this article are evident in other cultural contexts is an open empirical question. However, it is likely that other independent or individualistic cultures (e.g., many Western European contexts) that exhibit an emphasis on choice as a valuable and moral action that expresses one‚Äôs volition and preferences may similarly devalue bonding help compared to bridging help due to its relative lack of perceived choice (Madan et al., 2020; Savani et al., 2008, 2010). Yet, the associations between choice, agency, and morality that are pervasive in the U.S. context are much less evident in many other parts of the world, such as in more interdependent or collectivist contexts (e.g., East and South Asian contexts) where fulfilling one‚Äôs duties, responsibilities, commitments, and obligations to family members and close others is the root source of virtue and morality (Miller & Bersoff, 1992; Miller et al., 2011; Shweder & LeVine, 1984)._x000D_
_x000D_
Future research can also test if the default model assessed here through individual attitudes is reflected and promoted in common practices. If the default model of social good is pervasive, researchers should find evidence of it reflected in institutional practices and policies. For example, as colleges, universities, and employers evaluate candidates‚Äô experiences and background, what counts as valuable and diagnostic of future capacities‚Äîdonating time to charities or caretaking for family members? Investigations into practices that reflect the default model could help elucidate what maintains and transmits the broader perception that help to distant others is more of a contribution than help to close others._x000D_
_x000D_
Conclusion_x000D_
The current U.S. default model of social good is seemingly too narrow. It fails to fully recognize the social good generated by many Americans, and particularly those in lower social class contexts, through their everyday actions. Given that U.S. American culture emphasizes dignity and respect conferred through hard work (Bellah et al., 1985; Markus, 2017; Plaut et al., 2002; Weber, 2005), how one‚Äôs contributions are valued in the American cultural context also serves as a signal of who is valued. If people need to earn their place by demonstrating they contribute, a limiting model of contribution has significant implications‚Äîit can affect how people value others and how people feel valued (Case & Deaton, 2015; Goldman et al., 2018; Williams, 2017). In the increasingly stratified U.S. society, the current work underscores the urgency of identifying, recognizing, and rewarding more diverse forms of social contribution._x000D_","Americans in lower (vs. higher) social class contexts are less likely to believe they contribute to society. Helping others by giving one‚Äôs time is an important way of contributing to others that also varies with social class. Five studies (N = 7,326) investigated whether one source of the social class disparity in perceived contributions is a default model that considers helping distant others (i.e., bridging help, e.g., volunteering) as more of a contribution than helping close others (i.e., bonding help, e.g., caring for family members). In Study 1, Americans in lower (vs. higher) social class contexts perceived they contribute less to society (i.e., self-perceived contributions, Part A) and believed others perceive them as contributing less (i.e., metaperceived contributions, Part B). Studies 2‚Äì4 provide evidence for a default model of social good: Americans across social class contexts and even helpers themselves perceived bridging help as more of a contribution than bonding help, in part, because bridging help is perceived as reflecting more choice to help. With a representative sample (Midlife Development in the United States), Study 5 finds that Americans in lower (vs. higher) social class contexts engaged in relatively less bridging help and more bonding help. However, bridging help served as a stronger pathway to feelings of contributing than bonding help did. Together, these studies suggest that people in lower social class contexts may experience a psychological inequality, in part, because some of the forms of help that are most accessible, familiar, and practiced are widely perceived as less of a contribution.","1",0,"1","Political",3,1

Annual Review of Psychology. doi: 10.1146/annurev-psych-020924-124753.","We now discuss three topics that are relevant to boosting as well as to behavioral public policy approaches in general: harnessing existing evidence and concepts; designing, disseminating, and implementing boosts; and studying and evaluating boosts. _x000D_
_x000D_
6.1. Harnessing Existing Evidence and Concepts _x000D_
The pursuit of efficient and evidence-informed ways to educate and empower people is part of a time-honored tradition across research fields such as judgment and decision making (in particular, debiasing research; Milkman et al. 2009, Morewedge et al. 2015, Soll et al. 2015), educational science (Weinert 2001), lifespan psychology (Baltes et al. 1999), counseling psychology (Brown & Lent 2008), clinical psychology (Blagys & Hilsenroth 2002), health science (S√∏rensen et al. 2012), community psychology (Zimmerman 2000), and organizational science (Conger & Kanungo 1988). The boosting approach can therefore draw on a vast toolbox of empowering interventions (e.g., math bedtime story, lateral reading; see Table 1). Where no suitable intervention exists, new boosting interventions can be inspired by and developed on the back of evidence from existing lines of research. _x000D_
_x000D_
The fact that numerous research fields are developing methods for fostering people‚Äôs competences is good news: There are likely many boosts yet to be harnessed and adapted for behavioral public policy. However, the interdisciplinary, distributed, and heterogeneous nature of the evidence base for boosts also makes it challenging to discover and synthesize this diverse knowledge in order to build a cumulative and coherent science of boosting. Here we offer two strategies for making this challenge more manageable. _x000D_
_x000D_
First, use the conceptual triad of (a) societal challenges where citizens need to be empowered, (b) the human competences (cognitive and motivational) needed to tackle a particular challenge, and (c) boosting interventions that could promote those competences (see Table 1 for examples; see also Kozyreva et al. 2020). From a policy perspective, the first step is typically to start with a precise description of the problem (e.g., the rapid spread of harmful misinformation online). The next step consists in analyzing the causes of and enabling reasons for the problem. Typically, several factors (e.g., insufficient regulation, commercial incentives, individual behavior) collude in causing and amplifying a problem. In a third step, behavioral policy makers aiming to help people develop relevant competences would identify what competences and motivations can support citizens in dealing with the problem (e.g., accurately and efficiently assessing the reliability of information and its sources online; Geers et al. 2024) and search the literature for suitable interventions (e.g., lateral reading; McGrew 2024). _x000D_
_x000D_
Second, boosting research would profit from an ontology (Sharp et al. 2023) of boosting interventions along the lines of the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy developed for behavior change interventions (Marques et al. 2023). Such an ontology would make it easier to consolidate study results from the literature into topic-specific, machine-readable databases of studies (see, e.g., Spadaro et al. 2022 for a database of 2,636 studies on human cooperation), which in turn would make conducting meta-analyses more efficient (see also the Open Research Knowledge Graph; Auer et al. 2023). More generally, bridging ontologies from different domains (e.g., education and medicine) via foundational ontologies would facilitate discoveries of new applications for existing interventions and other insights. _x000D_
_x000D_
6.2. Designing, Disseminating, and Implementing Boosts _x000D_
Many studies of boosts provide proof of concept, that is, evidence that people can, in principle, be boosted (conceptually similar to efficacy trials in the health sciences, which test interventions in tightly controlled settings and prioritize internal over external validity; Bauer et al. 2015). For example, computer simulations show that simple decision trees can promote accurate decisions in difficult circumstances (e.g., time pressure, limited information; Katsikopoulos et al. 2020), such as when triaging patients (Keller et al. 2020). However, successfully teaching medical professionals a simple decision tree in a controlled setting does not guarantee that they will use it in practice. _x000D_
_x000D_
It will often be possible to embed the core boost (here, the simple decision tree) inside a broader, psychologically informed delivery vehicle. For example, when learning about a simple decision tree, people could be asked to specify their implementation intentions (i.e., the when, where, and how of using the decision tree in the form of if-then rules; see Gollwitzer & Sheeran 2006) and engage in mental contrasting (i.e., anticipating and planning around obstacles to using the decision tree; see Cross & Sheffield 2019, Oettingen 2012) to increase the likelihood that they will use the decision tree in the future. There are also domain-specific opportunities to design boosts that are easier to implement successfully. For example, teaching a simpler but slightly less precise decision tree instead of a more complex but slightly more accurate one can promote learning and reliable usage, resulting in the same‚Äîor better‚Äîperformance in practice. The adoption and dissemination of boosts can also be supported by the use of digital tools such as apps (Gr√ºning et al. 2023) or information formats such as fact boxes (see Reijula & Hertwig 2022). _x000D_
_x000D_
It is crucial to consider the broader context in which a boosting intervention is implemented (e.g., Bauer et al. 2015). For example, relevant stakeholders should be consulted early on so that they can offer insight into potential opportunities and constraints (e.g., what information is available to doctors at what point in a patient‚Äôs diagnosis and what could be included in a simple decision tree; Keller et al. 2020). _x000D_
_x000D_
6.3. Studying and Evaluating Boosts _x000D_
Next, we briefly discuss three research priorities in the study and evaluation of boosts and other types of behavioral public policies. These complement other, more general strategies advocated in the behavioral and other sciences for improving research and its dissemination (e.g., Holford et al. 2023, Nosek et al. 2022, Topp et al. 2018). _x000D_
_x000D_
First, given that long-term boosts aim to have lasting effects on competences, research needs to measure their longevity. To date, very few studies have examined the long-term effectiveness of boosting interventions (e.g., Loy et al. 2016, McDowell et al. 2019, Paunov & Gr√ºne-Yanoff 2023, Sedlmeier & Gigerenzer 2001, van Roekel et al. 2022). Longitudinal studies are more laborious and costly than cross-sectional studies, which may partly explain the dearth of longitudinal studies in behavioral public policy. One way to ease the logistical and financial burden is to collaborate in larger research teams (Forscher et al. 2023). _x000D_
_x000D_
Second, research on behavioral interventions should, by default, be comparative in nature. Ideally, different behavioral interventions would be compared in the same trials to gain a better understanding of when each intervention works best, and for whom (see, e.g., Banerjee et al. 2023, Folke et al. 2021, Franklin et al. 2019, Paunov & Gr√ºne-Yanoff 2023, van Roekel et al. 2022, for comparisons between boosts and nudges). Alongside key behavioral outcome measures, studies should also aim to assess the changes (or lack thereof ) in the competences hypothesized to drive behavior change whenever possible. This approach would make it possible to assess the extent to which an intervention achieves its goal via its hypothesized route (e.g., via improved competences in the case of boosting, via changing behavior in the case of nudging). It would also help refine existing theory-derived guidelines for assessing whether boosting or nudging can be expected to work better in a particular setting (Hertwig 2017; see also the sidebar titled When to Consider Boosting or Nudging). Megastudies that compare a larger number of treatments (Duckworth & Milkman 2022, Hameiri & Moore-Berg 2022) could be more feasible for larger research teams (in so-called team science; Forscher et al. 2023). _x000D_
_x000D_
Third, many studies of boosts provide promising proof of concept in the laboratory, but few have demonstrated the effects of boosts in the field (e.g., how boosting risk perceptions about infectious risks improves hand hygiene compliance among nurses in actual hospital wards; van Roekel et al. 2022). Being clear about the kind of evidence that studies provide (e.g., lab or field, populations studied, presence or absence of heterogeneous treatment effects, evidence on which psychological mechanisms produce the observed behaviors; see, e.g., Bryan et al. 2021a, Gr√ºne-Yanoff 2016) helps both researchers and practitioners estimate the expected success of an intervention in a particular setting and supports them in identifying future research priorities. _x000D_
_x000D_
7. THE LIMITS OF EMPOWERMENT _x000D_
Boosts are not a panacea; indeed, no single approach can eradicate major threats such as climate change, poverty, or disease. One explanation for this is offered by Gilmore et al.‚Äôs (2023, p. 1194) examination of emerging research on the commercial determinants of health: _x000D_
Although commercial entities can contribute positively to health and society there is growing evidence that the products and practices of some commercial actors‚Äînotably the largest transnational corporations‚Äîare responsible for escalating rates of avoidable ill health, planetary damage, and social and health inequity; these problems are increasingly referred to as the commercial determinants of health. The climate emergency, the non-communicable disease epidemic, and that just four industry sectors (ie, tobacco, ultra-processed food, fossil fuel, and alcohol) already account for at least a third of global deaths illustrate the scale and huge economic cost of the problem. . . . [T]he shift towards market fundamentalism and increasingly powerful transnational corporations has created a pathological system in which commercial actors are increasingly enabled to cause harm and externalize the costs of doing so. _x000D_
Alongside commercial determinants of health are social determinants of health (Braveman et al. 2011), such as income, knowledge gaps, educational attainment, and racial disparities. It would be na√Øve to believe that just one type of intervention can solve all these issues. We argue that an evidence-based and integrated policy mix including behavioral science‚Äìinformed regulation, education, boosting, choice architecture interventions, and other tools has the best chance of making a difference. _x000D_
_x000D_
7.1. The Trap of Individualizing Responsibility _x000D_
All interventions have benefits and drawbacks, and boosts are no exception. In this and the following subsection, we briefly discuss two noteworthy risks of boosts. First, policy makers need to be aware of the risk of shifting the blame. Chater & Loewenstein (2022) argued that corporations and entire industries, driven by the relentless pursuit of profit, have played a key role in creating numerous public health crises and societal problems, including the obesity, diabetes, and opioid epidemics; widespread climate change denial; and a tsunami of misinformation (see Chater & Loewenstein 2022 but also the critical commentaries of this article). One of the most consistently applied strategies that industries have used to shield themselves from accountability is to ‚Äúcast societal problems as issues of individual weakness and responsibility, the solutions to which involve ‚Äòfixing‚Äô individual behavior‚Äù (Chater & Loewenstein 2022, p. 2). For example, the fossil fuel lobby championed the concept of personal carbon footprints to shift attention away from regulating the industry‚Äôs carbon emissions (Schendler 2021). Similarly, credit card companies have pushed for financial literacy curricula in schools, purportedly to help people avoid financial debt. These efforts, however, can also be understood as cynical attempts to evade industry regulation (Olen 2013). _x000D_
_x000D_
Advocating for people to gain the competences they need to confront challenges can be misappropriated as a way to place the blame and burden of responsibility on the individual. In principle, which and to what extent determinants of health and well-being are social, commercial, or individual in nature requires empirical analysis, not commercially or politically motivated finger-pointing. And, as we discussed in Section 3, we think of competent citizens as a first line of response, not the only one; system-level solutions are also required (Hertwig 2023). Furthermore, boosting could complement system-level approaches, for example, by enhancing relevant competences (e.g., financial literacy) and thus making standard policy instruments (e.g., incentives for saving) more effective and more equitable (e.g., by increasing participation rate). _x000D_
_x000D_
7.2. Cognitive and Motivational Requirements and Social Inequality _x000D_
A second risk of boosting interventions is that they will create or exacerbate inequality. All boosts require individuals to have the cognitive abilities necessary to engage with the intervention and understand the basic principles at work (Gr√ºne-Yanoff & Hertwig 2016, Hertwig & Gr√ºne-Yanoff 2017; see also the sidebar titled When to Consider Boosting or Nudging), and in some cases not everyone will. This depends in part on the cognitive requirements‚Äîfor instance, math bedtime stories (Berkowitz et al. 2015) and decision trees are more cognitively demanding than the Dutch Reach method (Large et al. 2018). Similarly, boosting policies require the target audience to be motivated enough to acquire and use the competence offered. In the absence of such motivation, boosting interventions are unlikely to be effective. The entry costs of boosting interventions might lead them to discriminate against less educated or more disadvantaged populations. This is a serious risk, and its magnitude depends on the intervention in question (e.g., more people may be motivated to avoid injuring cyclists than to overcome math anxiety) as well as on how accessibly the boost is framed and explained and how demanding the prerequisite cognitive abilities are. _x000D_
_x000D_
Nudging also faces the challenge of inequality (see, e.g., Sch√ºz et al. 2021). The libertarian guardrail of nudging is the criterion of easy reversibility: The behavior change brought about by a nudge should be easy to reverse, allowing the individual to act otherwise. However, the ability to act otherwise also presupposes a minimum level of cognition and motivation. This is somewhat ironic, since some nudging interventions (e.g., those based on defaults; Jachimowicz et al. 2019) are designed to exploit people‚Äôs inertia. The risk here is that nudges are more likely to be accepted by less educated, less motivated, or less well-off groups (for the latter, see, e.g., Shafir 2017); if this were the case, these interventions would no longer preserve liberty in the population as a whole. _x000D_
_x000D_
8. CONCLUSIONS _x000D_
Proponents of nudging have argued that ‚Äúnudges are specifically designed to preserve full freedom of choice‚Äù (Sunstein 2014, p. 584). If this quality is ascribed to nudges, then it is all the more applicable to boosts. Boosts aim to help people make informed and good decisions by and for themselves. They also aim to maintain and promote agency, self-efficacy, and autonomy. While boosts alone are not sufficient to address the challenges of our time, it seems absurd, in the search for solutions, not to invest in the capabilities of human beings._x000D_","Behavioral public policy came to the fore with the introduction of nudging, which aims to steer behavior while maintaining freedom of choice. Responding to critiques of nudging (e.g., that it does not promote agency and relies on benevolent choice architects), other behavioral policy approaches focus on empowering citizens. Here we review boosting, a behavioral policy approach that aims to foster people's agency, self-control, and ability to make informed decisions. It is grounded in evidence from behavioral science showing that human decision making is not as notoriously flawed as the nudging approach assumes. We argue that addressing the challenges of our time-such as climate change, pandemics, and the threats to liberal democracies and human autonomy posed by digital technologies and choice architectures-calls for fostering capable and engaged citizens as a first line of response to complement slower, systemic approaches.","5",1,"3","Political",2,1

Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 127(3), 455‚Äì468.","The present work addressed a critical gap in the person perception literature, quantifying the relative contribution of faces and bodies to a variety of foundational social judgments. The results of Studies 1 and 2, which align with Hu and O‚ÄôToole‚Äôs (2023) trait-dependence hypothesis, indicate that faces and bodies differentially contribute to judgments along different primary axes of impression formation (at least in a Western culture‚Äîsee Table 2 for a summary of limitations). Specifically, bodies primarily drive judgments of attributes related to status and ability (e.g., competence, dominance, social class), whereas faces primarily drive judgments of age and attributes overgeneralized from emotion (e.g., warmth). This presents an important theoretical contribution, indicating that faces and bodies may have different degrees of signal or perceived value for different kinds of judgments. These findings also justify the focus on faces for some judgments (e.g., trustworthiness) but highlight the need to consider the body for others (e.g., status). _x000D_
_x000D_
We also found that bodies explain less variance as body information decreases (i.e., with photos above the waist vs. the whole person) or faces become more salient (i.e., larger face photos presented alongside whole-person photos). Though perhaps intuitive, this finding provides empirical support for focusing more heavily on face-based judgments in research interested in impression formation in online contexts (where body information tends to be less available), for example. More broadly, this finding indicates that the variance explained by faces and bodies depends on the information available and the context. Future research can build on these findings to explore how the context‚Äîboth the visual context in which the target appears and the context in which the perceiver forms their judgment‚Äîmay potentially affect the relative importance of faces and bodies for different social judgments. _x000D_
_x000D_
The findings from Studies 3 and 4 furthermore show that both faces and bodies can lead to accurate social judgments, using social class judgments as an example. Social class judgments reached the highest accuracy when bodies were visible, thereby supporting the idea that bodies (vs. faces) primarily drive judgments of attributes related to status or ability because of greater available signal in the body. Social class signal appeared to stem more from shape cues (including body shape, posture, and clothing shape) than from details of clothing. Although this finding may challenge intuition as well as recent theorizing (Hester & Hehman, 2023), clothing cues to social class may be easier to fake than other nonverbal body cues. In other words, body shape and posture may contain less controllable social class residue, whereas clothing could be strategically used to (at least somewhat) mask a person‚Äôs social class. We also found that bodies‚Äô perceived attractiveness facilitated accurate social class judgments, similar to faces and consistent with stereotypes linking attractiveness and status (Bjornsdottir & Rule, 2017; Dion et al., 1972). Although we operationalized social class in only one of many possible ways in these studies (according to family income), we anticipate the same pattern of results using other social class measures, as there were strong interrelations between judgments of different measures of social class using whole persons in Study 1 (see Supplemental Materials) and faces in previous research (Bjornsdottir, 2019). _x000D_
_x000D_
Throughout these studies, we observed some gender differences. In Study 1, bodies explained more variance for judgments of men than of women. Accuracy also differed in social class judgments (i.e., greater accuracy for judging men‚Äôs vs. women‚Äôs body silhouettes) and cue use: Perceivers used bodies‚Äô expansive posture/dominance to inform their judgments of men‚Äôs but not women‚Äôs social class (though expansive posture/dominance did not supply valid social class information for targets of either gender). We also found greater effects of women‚Äôs versus men‚Äôs faces (and men‚Äôs vs. women‚Äôs bodies) for whole-person judgments in a set of supplementary studies (see Supplemental Materials). Together, these findings provide preliminary evidence that the importance of bodily appearance in predicting social judgments differs by gender, building on existing findings that facial appearance matters more for social judgments of women than of men (Xie et al., 2019). Future research may wish to examine this question more systematically and to explore differences by target race (as well as intersections between gender and race), as previous research has done with faces (Xie et al., 2019). _x000D_
_x000D_
This work furthermore contributes to the growing area of wholeperson perception. Future research could additionally explore the specific cues in the body driving different social judgments, disentangling the contribution of body shape, posture, and clothing. For example, researchers could pair faces with different bodies all wearing the same clothing to isolate the effects of body shape and posture. Alternatively, research could directly test the effects of varying just a target‚Äôs clothing (but not their body shape or posture; expanding on Oh et al., 2020). Future research could also include stimuli with greater variation in weight and musculature (somewhat limited in our sample of targets) to better understand the contribution of body shape. Specific to social class judgments, future work could more thoroughly explore the specific cues that contribute to how attractiveness judgments facilitate social class judgment accuracy from bodies, for example, quantifying the contribution of perceived weight and height, musculature, and gendered shape (e.g., Hu et al., 2018). Relatedly, testing whether impressions beyond attractiveness help to explain social class judgment accuracy when examining body photos (vs. silhouettes) or whole persons would improve ecological validity. _x000D_
_x000D_
Another promising avenue for future research includes more thoroughly examining the reasons that bodies and faces explain different relative degrees of variance for specific social judgments. We suggested differences in signal as one possibility (and the results of Studies 3 and 4 provide support for this possibility, at least for judgments of social class), but research could move this idea further by investigating the contribution of faces and bodies to social judgment accuracy for a broader array of attributes. Perceivers‚Äô beliefs about what is most informative, and the relative salience of faces and bodies, likely also play a role (and Studies 1, 2, and the supplementary studies provide initial evidence for this). Researchers could explore this by manipulating the salience of each channel or by manipulating perceivers‚Äô beliefs about the informational value of faces versus bodies for different social judgments. _x000D_
_x000D_
Altogether, these findings add to the growing body of research on whole-person judgments, highlighting the importance of considering both bodies and faces when examining social judgments. The different amount of variance explained by faces and bodies for different kinds of social judgments may provide guidance for which aspects of target appearance researchers consider to best address their research questions. Thus, these data help to explain why people may favor faces over bodies (or vice versa) when expressing themselves and perceiving others in daily life._x000D_","Despite the primacy of the face in social perception research, people often base their impressions on whole persons (i.e., faces and bodies). Yet, perceptions of whole persons remain critically underresearched. We address this knowledge gap by testing the relative contributions of faces and bodies to various fundamental social judgments. Results show that faces and bodies contribute different amounts to particular social judgments on orthogonal axes of social perception: Bodies primarily influence status and ability judgments, whereas faces primarily influence warmth-related evaluations. One possible reason for this may be differences in signal that bodies and faces provide for judgments along these two axes. To test this, we extended our investigation to social judgment accuracy, given that signal is a precondition to accuracy. Focusing on one kind of status/ability judgment‚Äîimpressions of social class standing‚Äîwe found that perceivers can discern individuals‚Äô social class standing from faces, bodies, and whole persons. Conditions that included bodies returned higher accuracy, indicating that bodies may contain more signal to individuals‚Äô social class than faces do. Within bodies, shape cued social class more than details of individuals‚Äô clothing. Altogether, these findings highlight the importance of the body for fully understanding processes and outcomes in person perception.","2",0,"2","Apolitical",4,1
81,13,"Kakkar, H. (2024). Achieving social influence across gender and time: Are dominance and prestige equally viable for men and women? Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 127(3), 562‚Äì580.","The primary aim of this research was to explore, in a naturalistic setting, whether the two means to attain or uphold influence within social groups‚Äînamely, dominance and prestige‚Äîare equally effective for individuals regardless of their gender. Drawing from existing research on role congruity theory and potential backlash stemming from counter-stereotypical behaviors (Eagly & Karau, 2002), I posited that women, when compared to men, might perceive dominance as a less viable strategy for gaining influence, while men, in contrast to women, might find prestige less effective. These hypotheses were tested within the context of individuals‚Äô online social networks on Twitter, examining both immediate and longitudinal effects, and employing a larger sample size to enhance statistical robustness. In summary, this study, analyzing nearly 230,000 tweets, delved into the interactive impact of a focal user‚Äôs status strategy and their gender on the influence they wielded within their online social network. 

Supporting the hypotheses, the study‚Äôs results indicated that men gained more influence when relying on dominance to influence others, whereas for women, prestige proved to be a more beneficial means of attaining influence. Opting for a counter-stereotypical approach, like men relying on prestige or women relying on dominance, clearly emerged as a less viable path to influence. However, these effects became more nuanced when observed longitudinally over time. The findings suggest that the initial positive impact experienced by dominant men diminished over time, hinting that dominance might not be an effective long-term strategy, even for men, consistent with recent theoretical assertions (Anderson & Kilduff, 2009; Redhead et al., 2019). For women, dominance remained equally less viable, but it became a less consequential predictor over time. 

These results further indicate that the initial positive impact of stereotypically consistent evaluations of dominant men on social influence may diminish over time. In contrast, high-prestige men, who initially experienced less social influence, witnessed a gradual increase over time, although it remained lower than that of highprestige women. This highlights the attenuation of initial backlash against stereotypically inconsistent men in the long run. For women, the positive effect of prestige intensified over time. The initial advantage enjoyed by stereotypically consistent prestigious women became even more pronounced, indicating that prestige emerges as a more sustainable long-term strategy for both men and women (Durkee et al., 2020; Redhead et al., 2019). In summary, these findings underscore the interaction between gender role stereotypes and an individual‚Äôs underlying status strategy (dominance or prestige) in predicting their social influence over time. 

Additionally, similar interaction effects for network centrality were observed. Dominant men and prestigious women garnered more mentions and tweets from their online followers, and thus were more central within their online social network in comparison to prestigious men or dominant women. Importantly, the focal users‚Äô network centrality explained the differential interaction effect of dominance or prestige and gender on their social influence. This finding lends support to the possibility that perceptions of likeability (as indicated by greater interaction with online friends on social networks) may explain why dominance or prestige may not be equally viable ways of attaining influence, depending on the focal individual‚Äôs gender. 

Theoretical Contributions 
These findings offer several noteworthy theoretical contributions. First, they advance literature on social rank or influence, which, until now, has considered both dominance and prestige as equally effective paths to social influence. By integrating the literatures on stereotypes and backlash due to stereotype violation, this work underscores that women who try to gain influence by being dominant are punished by their group members as opposed to rewarded with a higher social rank. Likewise, men may discover that prestige is a less successful strategy for acquiring social influence compared to women, with these differences in prestige being more pronounced for men initially than over time. 

Furthermore, the extant evolutionary research suggests that, outside the very few matriarchal societies in the world, women have long been widely excluded from making important decisions for the group or holding leadership positions. As a result, past findings and generalizations related to dominance and prestige are largely based on observing men in ethnographic studies or groups with smallsample sizes. These factors may have hindered previous researchers from fully capturing the nuanced role of gendered expectations in the pursuit of social influence through dominance or prestige. Consequently, this work advances the literature by emphasizing that, despite having two available routes to status, the viability of each may vary depending on one‚Äôs gender. 

Second, through a longitudinal exploration of individuals‚Äô social influence within their network, this research provides a more nuanced understanding of the evolving interplay between dominance or prestige and gender. It becomes evident that dominance may not be a long-term sustainable strategy to gain influence even for men. Those aligned with dominance experience a decline in influence over time‚Äîa prediction that has been theorized (Anderson & Kilduff, 2009; Cheng, 2020) but lacked robust empirical support until now. This study contributes significantly to existing literature by empirically showcasing the limited ability of dominance to sustain influence over the long term. 

Moreover, it was noted that the impact of stereotype-consistent or inconsistent behaviors diminished in relevance over time. Longterm influence was primarily shaped by dominance or prestige, with dominance gradually losing effectiveness for men and prestige emerging as a viable strategy for both genders. Notably, women managed to sustain the initial benefits of prestige on social influence, continuing to derive more significant advantages than men. These findings make a meaningful contribution to role incongruity literature by emphasizing that stereotype backlash may wane over time, at least within these virtual hierarchies. An intriguing possibility is that group members developed a deeper familiarity with the focal individual, although this hypothesis requires further exploration due to the current data‚Äôs limitations in addressing familiarity claims. Overall, this work integrates role incongruity theory with the dominance‚Äìprestige framework, examining their interaction effects at both the aggregate level and over time in a stereotype-neutral context, thereby advancing our understanding that the viability of these paths is contingent on gender and time. 

Third, both theoretically and empirically, this study brings clarity to the relationship between dominance and prestige and their connection to agency. The previous research has hinted that both dominance and prestige possess agentic qualities (Cheng et al., 2010). However, dominance is generally perceived as considerably more agentic than prestige (Kakkar & Sivanathan, 2017; Maner & Case, 2016). The findings from Pilot Study 3 further illuminate this distinction, revealing that dominance aligns with more traditional notions of agency, encompassing attributes like ambition and action orientation. In contrast, prestige is linked with competence-related features of agency, such as self-assuredness, independence, or diligence. This is one of the first investigations to discern how dominance and prestige relate to agency. At the same time, the results suggest that prestige also embodies attributes associated with communion. Therefore, prestige is linked to both the vertical and horizontal dimensions of the social evaluation model, whereas dominance is exclusively reflective of the vertical dimension. 

Fourth, in contrast to the previous studies that predominantly assessed likability through Likert scale responses, this research took a novel approach by gauging likability behaviorally, employing network in-degree centrality as a proxy measure. The subsequent analysis unveiled a noteworthy finding: Focal members who deviated from their gender stereotypes appeared to be less connected or central in their network. This implies that an individual‚Äôs network centrality might be influenced by perceptions of likability. For a more precise understanding, future research could explore this by directly measuring the likability of focal actors. Further, given the context of an online social network, these findings suggest that stereotypical consequences manifest even in virtual settings, where, unlike in physical groups, the insight into members‚Äô thoughts and actions is far more limited. In other words, people view their online environment through the same stereotypical lens that they apply to their ‚Äúreal‚Äù environment and continue to dislike those who do not behave according to the prescribed stereotypes. This finding has profound implications for both men and women as much of our professional and social interactions are moving online. Unfortunately, it appears that behaving counter-stereotypically may incur social costs, even in virtual settings. 

Finally, this research addresses calls in the management and social psychology literature to leverage big data for exploring fundamental questions concerning the micro foundations of behaviors in groups and organizations (Adjerid & Kelley, 2018; George et al., 2014). Examining the role of dominance and prestige on social influence by capturing interactions in an online social network aligns with this objective. Additionally, the decision to utilize Twitter as a context for studying these social interactions is apt. In contemporary society, individuals not only dedicate a significant portion of their time to social media platforms but also actively seek status within these forums. Hence, this context offers a behavioral measure of influence, utilizing real-life interactions to investigate the evolving impact of dominance, prestige, and gender over time on influence. 

Limitations and Future Directions 
A notable limitation of this study lies in the correlational nature of the data, restricting the ability to draw causal inferences. It would have been ideal to study these interactions over a long period of time to offer more causal support. Nevertheless, given that these interactions were derived from the most recent 3,200 tweets for each participant (encompassing more than half of the participant‚Äôs entire Twitter history in many cases), there is confidence that observed trends are likely robust over time. The study also assumed that participants‚Äô dominance and prestige tendencies as captured via a self-rated questionnaire was reflected in their tweeting behavior. A post hoc analysis, involving the coding of tweets, revealed that dominant individuals‚Äô tweets indeed reflected greater dominance, consequently elucidating the relationship between dominance and the likelihood of retweets. 

However, in the post hoc analysis, trait prestige exhibited no significant association with retweet likelihood, and consequently, prestige-coded tweets did not serve as a mediating factor for the impact of prestige on influence, despite a positive correlation between self-rated prestige and prestige-coded tweets. Two possibilities could explain this null effect. First, it is conceivable that a larger sample size is necessary to discern positively valenced signals of prestige compared to the more pronounced negative signals associated with dominance, such as anger or intimidation. Second, the processes influencing the relationship between prestige and influence might extend beyond tweet content, involving the actions or interactions of others or the overall reputation of the focal actor. Hence, future research should delve into these possibilities. It is essential to note that, given the correlational nature of this study, there may be factors influencing participants‚Äô situational dominance or prestige, subsequently affecting their tweeting behavior. While the analysis controlled for recent trends in retweet count, there might be other unaccounted-for variables that could influence these findings. 

Another empirical limitation lies in using network centrality as a proxy for likability. Despite clear evidence indicating a positive correlation between liking and in-degree centrality, it is crucial to acknowledge that these two constructs are not synonymous. Moreover, on Twitter, in-degree centrality is linked to other related constructs such as popularity, knowledgeability, and prestige (Dubois & Gaffney, 2014; Gilbert & Paulin, 2015; Howlader & Sudeep, 2016; Riquelme & Gonz√°lez-Cantergiani, 2016). Therefore, the findings should be interpreted with these limitations in mind, as they might be capturing shared variance associated with these related constructs. Moreover, treating a greater number of tweets directed toward a focal actor as a sign of likeability is an assumption that requires further investigation. It would have been ideal to code followers‚Äô tweets for positive sentiment to avoid making the above assumption. However, such data were not collected. An attempt was made to mitigate this limitation by examining the correlation between in-degree centrality and the number of likes the focal actor‚Äôs tweets had received. The positive correlation between the two constructs somewhat attenuates this concern but does not resolve it completely. Hence, future research can measure the likeability of the focal actor more accurately to investigate the role of gendered processes in social networks. 

Despite controlling for both positive and negative emotions, the analysis did not control for any specific emotion. If a certain emotion is associated more with a particular status strategy (for instance, anger with dominance), it becomes crucial to consider the role of a specific emotion to accurately capture the impact of the status strategy. Thus, future research can benefit by first examining the relationship of specific emotional expressions with dominance or prestige and subsequently incorporating those specific emotions to uniquely examine the effect of these two status strategies on social influence. Future work can also seek to develop linguistic markers specifically associated with dominance and prestige. This development would facilitate testing the cues that observers directly associate with individuals embodying these status strategies. While this study used a validated instrument to measure dominance and prestige, offering precision in measurement, it did not consider the dominance and prestige cues present in the focal user‚Äôs tweets. Hence, future investigations focusing on the development of such linguistic cues or dictionaries can prove highly valuable. 

Another fruitful future direction would be to examine whether users eventually discover that one path to influence might be more effective than the other. If so, would they gradually start behaving in ways that better align with their prescribed gender stereotype? Examining these questions may shed light on when and why individuals may engage with more dominance or prestige influence strategies and what factors (including gender) may make them ‚Äúflip‚Äù and change their status-striving behaviors. Considering that dominance was generally less effective over time, irrespective of gender, a dominance strategy may prove counterproductive to leaders and teams, even in in-person settings. While the present results do not directly address in-person interactions, indirect evidence supports the aforementioned notion. Teams led by directive leaders‚Äîassertive figures who closely monitor subordinates‚Äô actions and provide detailed instructions‚Äîtend to underperform over time compared to teams led by empowering leaders (Lorinkova et al., 2012). This is because such teams rely on acquiescence rather than investing in developing their skills and expertise over time. Leaders associated with dominance share some attributes similar to directive leaders; therefore, one might expect analogous findings for dominance. This intriguing possibility could be tested in future research. 

Additionally, it is important to explore the consequences of social influence on users of online social networks. Prior research indicates that online users who are not well-liked by their virtual friends may experience low self-esteem, reduced well-being, and even depression. If backlash resulting from stereotypical gender perceptions leads to negative consequences for certain men and women, it would be a significant finding in advancing our understanding of rewards and punishments in virtual contexts. Finally, this study underscores gender as a pivotal factor that might render either dominance or prestige a less viable strategy compared to the other. Future research can extend this exploration to consider additional factors that may affect this choice, such as group members‚Äô beliefs or alignment with specific cultural and moral values. 

Conclusion 
By analyzing a large sample of individuals‚Äô social interactions on Twitter, this study reveals that dominance and prestige might not be equally viable or effective means to gain influence for all individuals. Instead, the efficacy of these status-striving strategies is contingent upon an individual‚Äôs gender and time. The research finds that men and women who defy their prescribed stereotypes by exhibiting prestigious or dominant behaviors, respectively, tend to occupy fewer central positions in their social networks, leading to a diminished level of social influence. In doing so, this work offers important caveats to the dominance-prestige framework of social rank.
","The dual framework of social rank allocation discusses dominance and prestige as two viable routes to status or social influence. In doing so, this literature has largely neglected findings demonstrating backlash against men and women for behaving in gender-incongruent ways. Likewise, it remains unclear if dominance and prestige continue to be effective means to status over time. This study investigates the viability of dominance or prestige in contributing to an individual‚Äôs social influence, conditional on their gender and across time. Using a stereotype-neutral context of an online social network, I unobtrusively tracked individuals‚Äô changes in social influence among their network members on Twitter. By analyzing almost 230,000 tweets, it was found that men‚Äôs influence increased with greater dominance, whereas women‚Äôs decreased. At the same time, women‚Äôs influence increased with greater prestige, whereas men‚Äôs decreased. Network centrality (in-degree centrality) explained this differential interaction pattern. Additionally, longitudinal analysis provided a more nuanced understanding. Over time, role incongruence effects dampened, dominance became less effective, even for men, and prestige became viable for both men and women. Thus, by jointly considering the role of gender and time, this research offers key theoretical caveats to the dual rank framework.","3",0,"3","Political",3,1

Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 127(3), 638‚Äì663.","We tested four factors of blame toward current groups for their historical wrongs. We found correlational and causal evidence for our hypothesized factors across a broad range of hypothetical and real events. We found that when people perceive current perpetrator group to have connectedness with their past, the current victim group to be suffering due to past harm, the current perpetrator group to be benefiting from past harm, and the current perpetrator group to have not fulfilled their obligations to remedy the wrong, historical blame judgments toward the current perpetrator groups are higher. On the whole, this was consistent across the location of the event (whether the participant was judging a historical American event or a historical non-American event), the group membership of the participant (whether the participant belonged to the victim or perpetrator group or neither/privileged or marginalized group), the ideology of the participant (whether the participant identified as a liberal or conservative), and the age of the participants. We also found that these factors were causally associated with behavioral intention, such as support for compensation to victim groups. Finally, we also found that historical blame attribution might mediate the effect of the key factors on support for compensation to victim groups. The four psychological factors that we identified as antecedents to perceptions of historical blame all help psychologically bridge the past and present. These factors provide psychological links between the past and present groups, in their characteristics (connectedness), outcomes (harm/benefit), and actions (unfulfilled obligations). 

There were some exceptions and inconsistent findings. In Studies 3 and 4, the effect of continued benefits was mixed. Perpetrator groups benefiting from past wrongs showed a significant effect on historical blame for only one of two manipulated levels of the factor (medium outcomes in Study 3 and poor outcomes in Study 4). The effects at the other levels were not significant, although they were still in the predicted direction. Results from all four studies taken together suggest that continued benefits are an important factor in historical blame. However, future studies should test this relationship more thoroughly in different experimental contexts. 

Moderation analyses of the relationship between our factors and historical blame across the four studies showed inconsistent results. Results from all four studies are summarized in Supplemental Table S53. For most of our interactions, our studies had substantial power to detect a small effect size (see Supplemental Table S54). None of the moderators, event location, group membership, ideology, or age had any reliable impacts on the effect of all four factors on historical blame. The dominant finding was that of a nonsignificant moderation (approximately 75% of the 62 moderations), and the moderations that were significant were not replicated across studies in significance nor direction (e.g., the positive effect of continued suffering on historical blame was sometimes stronger for conservatives, sometimes weaker). Thus, we did not interpret any of the moderation results. Additionally, most of the significant moderations were indexing a small difference in the strength of the predicted relationship (for instance, in Studies 1 and 2, the relationship between connectedness and blame for perpetrator groups was weaker but still significant and in the predicted direction; for other examples, see Supplemental Tables S36, S38, and S51). The nonsignificant moderations forming the majority of the results were largely very small in size and inconsistent across studies in direction, making them difficult to detect and of unclear practical importance. Thus, our overall takeaway is that our predictions are largely supported across different moderators. Whenever and for whomever there are higher judgments on the four factors, there are higher levels of historical blame. 

Although there were no reliable moderations by group membership, it is important to note that group membership does matter. It predicts mean levels of theoretically meaningful variables and historical blame judgments (Figures 4 and 5). For instance, members of victim groups compared to perpetrator groups perceived higher connectedness of perpetrator groups over time, higher continued suffering of victim groups from past wrong, higher continued benefits of victim groups from past wrongs, and lower levels of perceived fulfilled obligations than perpetrator groups. They also attribute higher historical blame. Group membership just does not moderate the relationship between these variables and historical blame. Other individual differences, such as prejudice, colorblind ideology, or individualism, might also be associated with historical blame. We also suspect that these variables will have main effects on historical blame rather than interactive effects between the individual differences and the four factors. 

Theoretical Implications 
Blame 
Our research extends psychological theories of blame by highlighting the historical dimension of time. Theories of blame attempt to explain blame toward individuals or groups for their actions in the present (Alicke, 2000; Denson et al., 2006; Lickel et al., 2001, 2003; Malle et al., 2014). In these theories, it is assumed that the blameworthy actions and their perpetrator co-occur at the same time. Hence, these blame theories are insufficient to explain blame toward current group members separated in time from when the historical wrong took place. The standard set of criteria (e.g., causality, intentionality, preventability, capacity, entitativity) that form the basis of evaluations in theories of blame (Alicke, 2000; Denson et al., 2006; Lickel et al., 2003; Malle et al., 2014) does not help explain the type of blame highlighted in our research as they do not apply in such a case. Present-day group members cannot intend, cause, facilitate, or prevent historical harmful events from happening. Theories of blame claim that the blame process begins with the detection of harm, which leads people to collect information on these criteria before making a blame judgment (Malle et al., 2014). Our research suggests that while the blame process is engendered by registering a harmful event, people collect a different sort of information for historical blame than the information highlighted by current theories of blame events. This has implications for theories of blame. 

First, our research identifies criteria for judgments of blame that have been overlooked. This includes the idea of forward responsibility, which is the responsibility for remedying or repairing harm after the event has happened (Smiley, 2023). This is in contrast to theories of blame, which use criteria like preventability and capacity, which rely on a backward-looking idea of responsibility (Gilbert, 2006). Thus, the theories focus on factors that occurred before the harmful event happened. Our research suggests that blame is also affected by factors that occur after a harmful event. The target might not have intended for the harm to happen, nor have caused it or were in a place to prevent it from happening, but they might be subject to blame because they failed to do anything afterward to address the harm. Similarly, the results for continued benefit suggest that psychological theories of blame do not consider factors that occur afterward, for example, if someone is deriving benefit from the wrongdoing afterwards. 

Second, we highlight that the theories of blame rest on the assumption that the moral violation and the perpetrators co-existed at the same time. However, this assumption does not hold for historical judgments of blame. Thereby, we need criteria for blame judgments that are relatively unexplored in the blame literature, like the connectedness of perpetrator over time or the continued harm of victims and the continued benefit of perpetrators as important factors on which people base their judgments. 

Historical Narratives and Memory 
The historical dimension of time is also central to work on historical narratives and memory. Specifically, this work focuses on the ways in which people establish a link between the groups‚Äô past and present and the implications these temporal representations have on attitudes and behavior (Bilali & Vollhardt, 2019; Freel & Bilali, 2022; Hirschberger, 2018; Liu & Hilton, 2005; Sibley et al., 2008; Wertsch, 2008). Accordingly, our work also contributes to this line of work. Our work identifies and tests factors that contribute to the perceptions of temporal continuity in groups, which might also serve as the contents of historical narratives or memories on which people and groups differ. While some of these factors have been explored in work on historical narratives (e.g., continued suffering), other factors have either not been talked about or amply tested (e.g., continued benefit, forward obligations, connectedness). Future work on historical narratives can explore the extent to which these factors emerge and have an impact on historical narratives. 

Intergroup Reconciliation 
Our work also makes contributions to theoretical perspectives on intergroup reconciliation which propose that reconciliation is an emotion regulation process (ƒåehaji¬¥c-Clancy et al., 2016). This work puts emotions at the crux of the reconciliation process after an intergroup conflict. It posits that managing emotions like guilt and anger paves the way for successful reconciliation between groups. One important way to achieve this, according to the theory, is by cognitive change or targeting underlying beliefs through cognitive reappraisal. Our work on historical blame and its antecedences thus suggests the kinds of beliefs that would likely have to undergo change to observe changes in emotional responses. While some of these factors have been suggested in this work (e.g., connectedness), other factors that we have identified and tested can be incorporated more in future work on the cognitive inputs to emotional regulation and intergroup reconciliation.

Collective Guilt 
Collective guilt may be related to historical blame. Thus, we find it useful to clarify how historical blame may be related to the adjacent phenomenon of collective guilt (Wohl et al., 2006). Collective guilt is the emotion experienced when one perceives their own group to have committed immoral acts (Wohl et al., 2006). Historical blame is primarily different from collective guilt in three ways. First, the idea of historical blame solely focuses on past wrongs by group members for which the original perpetrators are not alive anymore. Thus, the historical dimension of time is important to its conceptualization. The objects of blame are group members separated in time from when the historical wrong took place and the actual perpetrators of the historical wrong. Collective guilt does not draw this distinction. Collective guilt is also experienced for contemporary wrongs by group members (Iyer et al., 2003). Thus, historical blame and collective guilt can be experienced for different events. 

Second, collective guilt is affect-based or emotion-based, whereas judgments of blame are cognitive. It is conceptualized as the output of an information processing system that takes various criteria as inputs (Malle et al., 2014). The definition of collective guilt, in fact, presupposes that a blame judgment has already taken place. Third, collective guilt is a psychological experience primarily from the perspective of perpetrator group members, whereas historical blame is a judgment that can be made from the viewpoint of the perpetrator, the victim, or a third party. That is, the subject of collective guilt is different from historical blame. People can blame their own group or other groups for past atrocities, whereas collective guilt is only about their own group‚Äôs actions. 

Taken together, these differences between historical blame and collective guilt suggest that historical blame may underlie feelings of collective guilt when events take place in the past and people are members of the perpetrator group. This is consistent with theories of emotion (Frijda et al., 1989; Mackie et al., 2000; Roseman et al., 1994) that suggest that emotions mediate the effects of cognitions on behavior. Thus, our study speaks to what might be considered as cognitive antecedents to the experience of the emotion of collective guilt, and thereby behavior such as support for reparations, apologies, and so forth. This is also consistent with recent work on intergroup reconciliation, which sees reconciliation as an emotion regulation process and cognitive change as an antecedent to that process (ƒåehaji¬¥c-Clancy et al., 2016). We speculate that historical blame and its antecedents might provide the first input to the cognitive appraisal ‚Üí emotion ‚Üí behavior sequence proposed by theories of emotion (Frijda et al., 1989; Mackie et al., 2000; Roseman et al., 1994). It would therefore be useful in future work, to integrate work on historical blame with work on collective guilt, apologies, and forgiveness (Van Tongeren et al., 2014; Wohl et al., 2006) to get a full understanding of both the cognitive and emotional processes operating in the contexts of historical wrongdoing. 

Strengths and Limitations 
Our research has the following strengths. First, it extends the literature on blame and intergroup relationships by identifying the criteria involved in the historical blame process. Second, Studies 1 and 2 use a variety of real historical events from around the world, which help us generalize the relationship observed between our predictors and blame across situations. Typical studies only pick a few groups or events (Brown et al., 2008; Burns & Granz, 2022; Halperin et al., 2011; Starzyk & Ross, 2008, 2012; Wohl & Branscombe, 2005). This is a shortcoming because effects may be driven by idiosyncratic characteristics of the event. Our design avoids this problem. Third, studies about moral judgments predominantly involve studying the phenomenon in hypothetical situations with ‚Äúraceless, genderless strangers,‚Äù and deprived of real-world context (Hester & Gray, 2020; Schein, 2020). Using real-world events in Studies 1 and 2 circumvents this limitation. We also establish causal relationships between our key predictors and blame using hypothetical events and groups in Studies 3 and 4. Fourth, although our studies used online and student samples of U.S. Americans, our studies used sample sizes larger and more diverse than have been typically used in past studies in the moral judgments and group processes literature. This is in contrast to the typical study in psychology, which mostly captures the psychological processes of White Americans and perpetuates epistemological bias against marginalized perspectives in science (Roberts et al., 2020; Salter & Adams, 2013). Our purposive oversampling of racial minority groups thus aimed to balance the analytic lens through which topics (such as historical blame) relevant to systemic power and privilege are studied (Salter & Adams, 2013). Fifth, we replicate our findings in two different types of samples which lends confidence to the validity and generalizability of our findings. Sixth, in answering our research question, we bring together the literature on moral judgments, group processes, and intergroup relations together from psychology, philosophy, legal studies, and politics. 

Despite these strengths, there were some limitations. First, because we wanted to capture a diverse set of events and groups and because our samples were limited to U.S. Americans, we ended up with fewer events and groups in our studies that were personally and emotionally relevant to any particular ethnic, racial, or gender group member making the blame judgments. Thus, for some events in Studies 1 and 2 (and all events in Studies 3 and 4), the blame judgments in our study reflect the historical blame process as a third party. Although it is possible that the blame process may be different when people judge past events and groups in a conflict their own ancestors were involved in, the evidence from our studies is not clearly consistent with this. For example, we controlled for familiarity, and this did not meaningfully affect the estimates. We also estimated interactions between our key predictors and event location and group membership. Presumably, events located in the United States would be more relevant for our U.S. American sample. Similarly, presumably events where participants were members of either victim or perpetrator groups would be relevant for those participants. Across these different cases, we still found support for our predictions. 

Although it is possible that these factors we considered did not directly tap into the relevance of all of the events, at this stage, we believe that the results suggest that the relationship between predictors and blame is the same for personally or emotionally relevant events. More studies that focus on only personally relevant events will be necessary to confirm this, as some of our moderation tests had limited power to detect very small group differences (Supplemental Table S54). Notably, we predict similarity in the relationship between the key predictors and historical blame regardless of the judger‚Äôs identity. To the extent historical blame is attributed (by victim or perpetrator, by a citizen, or noncitizen), we expect that it will be determined by the key predictors to a similar degree for various people. Group differences should show up in the average differences in predictors and/or historical blame. That is, judging an atrocity in which one‚Äôs ancestors wronged against others might incline people to perceive less connectedness, less continued suffering, less continued benefit, and more fulfilled obligation. It might also incline them to attribute less historical blame. The crux of the historical blame process is that both these predictors and historical blame would move together in the predicted directions, even for people with different perspectives on the wrong. 

Even if the historical blame process we captured is mostly from a third party‚Äôs perspective, they are still an important and useful phenomenon to understand. Third-party perspectives on historical wrongs are an understudied phenomenon in psychology (Vollhardt & Bilewicz, 2013). Groups and people are often put in a position to form such third-party judgments for both social and practical purposes with real-world implications, such as support for compensatory policies (Studies 3 and 4). We see this when the international community or national entities uninvolved in the original wrong frequently condemn another national group for its historical wrongs, often with implications for international relations (e.g., Armenian genocide, Erkoyun & Gumrukcu, 2021). Within a country, views of groups uninvolved in the original wrong have important political implications, such as their support for reparations or policies related to addressing historical wrongs in institutions such as schools and workplaces. For example, Pew recently found that the majority of all racial groups in the United States, except Black Americans, were against reparations for slavery (Pew Research Center, 2022). The extent of third-party blame toward perpetrators may go beyond shaping support for compensatory policies (such as in Studies 3 and 4) and shape other intergroup perceptions, such as trust, sympathy, caution, and threat, amongst others. 

Second, our method for categorizing participants into victim and perpetrator groups may be another limitation. Consider the events where we categorized participants into victim or perpetrator groups based on their self-reported ethnicity. For example, for the event regarding Native American displacement, we categorized people who reported Native American as their ethnicity/race as a victim group member and people who reported White American as their ethnicity/race, as a perpetrator group member. We did not include measures of participants‚Äô level of identification or attachment with these ethnic/racial groups, their subjective identification as ‚Äúvictims‚Äù and ‚Äúperpetrators,‚Äù nor asked them about their direct descendance from original victims or perpetrators. These choices were made because group differences were not our primary focus, and we aimed to keep the study a manageable length. However, they might not have given us the complete picture of group membership and limited our inference about group differences in the historical blame process. Existing scholarship highlights the different ways members of victim and perpetrator groups might think of their status as ‚Äúvictim‚Äù or ‚Äúperpetrator‚Äù (Bilali & Vollhardt, 2019). Future studies can thoroughly test these group differences by drawing out a more complete picture of group membership and seeing if our results replicate. 

Notably, our categorizations, although not perfect, were able to capture meaningful group differences. An analysis of the average levels of our predictors and historical blame in Studies 1 and 2 showed that victim and perpetrator groups differed on these variables in expected ways (Figures 4 and 5, Supplemental Tables S29‚ÄìS32). These are in line with past literature on group differences in the construal of historical atrocities and trauma (Bilali & Vollhardt, 2019; Hirschberger, 2018; Li et al., 2023; Nelson et al., 2013; Shnabel & Nadler, 2008; Vollhardt & Bilewicz, 2013). 

The third limitation of our studies was that we did not systematically include behavioral measures to test for their association with historical blame and its antecedents. We did include support for compensation in Studies 3 and 4 and found that historical blame might mediate the effects of the four factors on support for compensation. However, we are limited in that inference given that these were measured in the context of hypothetical events. Future research would benefit from systematically integrating the current research with behavioral intentions and actual behavioral outcomes. This could include measures such as signing a petition to support reparations or opposing the teaching of critical histories in school. These would help closely assess the practical implications of historical blame and its antecedents. 

Fourth, our samples were restricted to U.S. participants which limits cross-cultural generalizability. Research in moral psychology suggests that culture shapes moral judgments in various ways, such as through religious differences, social ecology, and social institutions (Graham et al., 2016). Future work can test if historical blame and its antecedents work similarly in different cultural contexts. 

Fifth, Studies 3 and 4 demonstrated a causal effect of our key predictors on historical blame. It is possible that the reverse causal relationship is also true; that is, people first experience blame and then try to rationalize that blame with different perceptions of the situation. We did not test this reverse causal relationship in our work, which would be an interesting future direction for our work. Such a relationship has been demonstrated for individual blame (Alicke, 2000; Ditto et al., 2009) and awaits demonstration for historical blame. Finding such a reciprocal relationship will not undermine our findings. It would suggest that historical blame and the predictors we have identified may have a mutually reinforcing relationship. 

Finally, although we focused on these four factors, it is likely that there are other important factors as well that will add to the understanding of the historical blame phenomena. These should be theorized and investigated. For example, while our work did consider the connectedness of perpetrator group over time, it is also possible that connectedness of victim groups over time is also an important input to historical blame. Research on victim blame highlights victim characteristics that lessen blame toward the perpetrator (e.g., Alicke & Zell, 2009). This line of research suggests that victim characteristics, in addition to perpetrator characteristics, should be incorporated when studying blame. Our work focused on the straightforward components derived from the conceptual analysis of moral wrongdoing (i.e., perpetrators, their actions, their outcomes), which also mapped onto important components highlighted in theories of blame (Malle, 2021). However, future research on historical blame can incorporate aspects of blame that are relatively underemphasized in theories of blame, such as victim group characteristics (e.g., perceived morality of victim group over time). 

Conclusion 
Many groups, societies, and nations are increasingly reckoning with the moral failings of their past, be it slavery, colonialism, genocide, wars, or invasions. These historical atrocities leave psychological legacies that have a direct bearing on intergroup relations in the present between those groups that had wronged and those that were wronged. In such times, one key question is: what would make a group free from blame for past wrongs? 

Our research explored the question of when and why the past burdens the successors of some groups. In doing so, it highlights what would need to change (e.g., things perpetrator groups can do) to reduce blame and for intergroup relations to improve. For example, our work suggests that perpetrator groups need to show evidence that they have sufficiently changed their values and norms and are disconnected from their past members, or take action to ameliorate the legacy of the unjust past. Alternatively, it provides insight into psychological conditions under which perpetrator groups might accept blame and support actions that redress the continued impact of these wrongs, such as perceiving continued suffering or unearned benefits from the historical wrongs. Finally, historical wrongs play an important role in political discourse in many places around the world. Our research provides insight into the factors that can be used in political narratives to mobilize electoral support by inducing historical blame and promises for redressal. Alternatively, it shows factors that can be used in political narratives to delink the past and present, diminish historical blame, and mobilize opposition against policies that redress past wrongs. Overall, it can help us better understand politics centered around invoking the past in the present and citizens‚Äô response to it. Future studies can test the function historical blame and its antecedents play in the context of interpersonal and intergroup group relations, support for restorative or preventative actions, and political discourse and action. 

Here, we would note that not all blame reduction paths that we have identified might always lead to improvement in intergroup relations or bring about societal justice in the normative sense. For instance, imagine a scenario in which motivated political propaganda convinces members of victim groups that historical atrocities their group has suffered through have no bearing on their present conditions (i.e., there is no continued suffering from the past wrong). This might reduce historical blame toward current perpetrator groups and descriptively improve intergroup attitudes and harmony. However, such perceptions associated with blame reduction might not necessarily conform to the truth. Therefore, whether the ‚Äúimprovement‚Äù in intergroup relations that such perceptions bring about is normatively an improvement, from the perspective of justice and an accurate understanding of reality, is a complicated ethical matter needing philosophical or ethical addressal. There might be some ways that are more just than others in improving intergroup relations, a moral question worth asking.
","Groups have committed historical wrongs (e.g., genocide, slavery). We investigated why people blame current groups who were not involved in the original historical wrong for the actions of their predecessors who committed these wrongs and are no longer alive. Current models of individual and group blame overlook the dimension of time and therefore have difficulty explaining this phenomenon using their existing criteria like causality, intentionality, or preventability. We hypothesized that factors that help psychologically bridge the past and present, like perceiving higher (a) connectedness between past and present perpetrator groups, (b) continued privilege of perpetrator groups, (c) continued harm of victim groups, and (d) unfulfilled forward obligations of perpetrator groups would facilitate higher blame judgments against current groups for the past. In two repeated-measures surveys using real events (N1 = 518, N2 = 495) and two conjoint experiments using hypothetical events (N3 = 598, N4 = 605), we find correlational and causal evidence for our hypotheses. These factors link present groups to their past and cause more historical blame and support for compensation policies. This work brings the dimension of time into theories of blame, uncovers overlooked criteria for blame judgments, and questions the assumptions of existing blame models. Additionally, it helps us understand the psychological processes undergirding intergroup relations and historical narratives mired in historical conflict. Our work provides psychological insight into the debates on intergenerational justice by suggesting methods people can use to ameliorate the psychological legacies of historical wrongs and atrocities.","1",0,"1","Political",2,1
83,13,"Moshagen, M., Hilbig, B. E., & Zettler, I. (2024). How and why aversive personality is expressed in political preferences. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 127(3), 664‚Äì683.","The notion that personality dispositions may promote specific beliefs and values concerning the ordering of society, and thus influence political orientation and behavior, has been confirmed by many studies, demonstrating the relevance of traits beyond socioeconomic variables canonically considered in the political sciences (e.g., Gerber et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2018; Schoen & Schumann, 2007; Vecchione et al., 2011). In light of both, (a) theoretical reasoning implying the relevance of dispositional tendencies to assign a higher weight to one‚Äôs own utility above others‚Äô, and (b) inconsistent findings (Bartolo & Powell, 2024) concerning specific aversive personality traits (e.g., psychopathy) that typically conflate aversive and nonaversive aspects (Bader et al., 2023), the present work investigated whether the ‚Äúaversive essence‚Äù of such traits as viewed through the lens of the D Factor of Personality (D; Moshagen et al., 2018) is associated with right-wing political orientation and corresponding voting behavior as well as underlying belief systems._x000D_
_x000D_
D defines aversive personality as the general tendency to maximize one‚Äôs own utility at the expense of other individuals or groups accompanied by beliefs that are used to construct justifications for such behavior. These defining features of D mandate an association with more right-wing political orientations. First, individuals prioritizing their own utility at others‚Äô costs are expected to uphold the existing societal system for either instrumental reasons or as a ‚Äúpalliative‚Äù measure. Second, they tend to hold exactly those beliefs (to form justifications for their own aversive behavior) that are commonly assumed to underly right-wing orientations, in particular beliefs implying a competitive and dangerous worldview as well as beliefs favoring dominance, hierarchies, and inequality. _x000D_
_x000D_
These predictions were herein corroborated by showing a substantial association between D and right-wing orientations in terms of a single left‚Äìright continuum that proved robust over 31 countries in Study 1 as well as substantial ties to the ideological belief dimensions of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientations (SDO) that were again cross-culturally consistent across 30 countries (and indeed of similar magnitude in many non-Western countries and countries that are not characterized as free liberal democracies) in Study 2. These findings extended to voting behavior in a longitudinal setting and held when controlling for demographic characteristics and the full basic personality space (all dimensions of the HEXACO model of personality) in Study 3. Finally, also in Study 3, we provided support for the proposition that the association between D and the endorsement of right-wing ideologies (and voting) can be accounted for by shared belief systems between those high in D and those endorsing right-wing ideologies. _x000D_
_x000D_
Importantly, the results indicate that D is associated with rightwing ideology as strongly as (with respect to a single left‚Äìright continuum and voting behavior) or more strongly than (with respect to ideological belief dimensions) Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness, which are the dimensions of basic personality meta-analytically demonstrating the strongest links to political ideology (Jost et al., 2003; Sibley & Duckitt, 2008; Zettler et al., 2020). Arguably as a consequence of the pivotal role of beliefs in the D framework, exceeding their role in any dimension of basic personality of either the five-factor or the HEXACO model, D not only was the strongest predictor but indeed increased the proportion of explained variance in political orientation and voting, respectively, by about one third over demographic variables and the entire HEXACO space. At the same time, D accounted for other proportions of the variance in political orientation than Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness. This is likely due to the fact that both Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness primarily exert their influence with respect to sociocultural liberalism versus conservatism (i.e., RWA), whereas D more strongly captures interindividual differences in economic liberalism versus conservatism (i.e., SDO). _x000D_
_x000D_
Indeed, certain implications of authoritarianism-related beliefs are partly at odds with the goal of own utility maximization, in particular authoritarian subordination and abidance by rules and order. For a high-D individual, obedience is primarily useful given an elevated hierarchical position, and rules are more likely to be followed and enforced whenever this is unilaterally beneficial. By comparison, both competitive jungle beliefs and SDO immediately and more generally relate to own utility maximization at the cost of others. As such, it is not surprising that D showed consistently stronger relations to SDO than to RWA and exhibited statistical relations to right-wing ideologies primarily‚Äîbut not exclusively‚Äî through competitive jungle beliefs and SDO. _x000D_
_x000D_
In summary, the finding that D incrementally and substantially improved the prediction of political orientation and voting beyond the entire HEXACO space suggests that aversive personality in terms of the D factor should be regularly considered beyond basic dimensions of personality when the aim is to explain political orientations by trait variables and also when explaining the substantial genetic sources of political ideology (Dawes & Weinschenk, 2020) in terms of personality dispositions. More generally, these results further underscore the importance of studying aversive personality in its own right (Rogoza et al., 2022; Schreiber & Marcus, 2020). Indeed, the findings are not only compatible with recent demonstrations that D substantially improves the prediction of other sociopolitical variables‚Äîspecifically, populism and conspiracy mentality‚Äîbeyond the basic personality space (Thielmann & Hilbig, 2023) but also adds to the growing body of findings demonstrating that D is functionally distinct from any one dimension in basic personality models (Hilbig et al., 2021; Horsten et al., 2021, 2021, 2023; Moshagen, Zettler, Horsten, et al., 2020). _x000D_
_x000D_
Cross-Cultural Robustness _x000D_
Despite the robust and consistent associations between D and right-wing orientations in terms of a single left‚Äìright dimensions, it should be noted that the effect sizes varied rather substantially by country. These variations are likely due to the fact that the left‚Äìright continuum might carry different meanings in different countries (Federico & Malka, 2018; Freire & Kivistik, 2013; Thorisdottir et al., 2007; Wojcik et al., 2021) and might also to some extent reflect group identification, in particular, in countries with a comparatively higher level of development (Federico & Malka, 2018; Kivikangas et al., 2021; but see Orr et al., 2023). Another potential explanation for the cross-cultural variations might lie in the (recent) political history of a country. Considering European countries, for instance, the relation between D and political orientation seems to be stronger in countries having experienced prominent (violent) right-wing movements in the 20th century (e.g., Austria, Germany, Italy) as compared to countries with a Communist past (e.g., Croatia, Poland, Romania). While we caution against overinterpreting such single cross-country differences, these issues nevertheless may explain at least some of the observed cross-cultural variation in the magnitude of the relationship between D and political orientation. _x000D_
_x000D_
In line with this reasoning, the relations between D and the ideological belief dimensions RWA and SDO were overall more homogeneous, with few exceptions. For instance, D exhibited notably weaker relations to SDO in China, Japan, and Norway, but notably stronger relations in Belgium, France, and Sweden. Although one might generally expect contextual factors to act as moderators between political orientation and basic psychological variables, it is not immediately evident which country-level feature might have driven these differences. Of note, neither the level of human development nor the degree of political freedom is suited to explain these differences as both failed to act as moderators. Of course, some of the heterogeneity may be simply due to peculiarities of the sample compositions or other artifacts, rather than resulting from features related to the political system or other cultural differences. This notwithstanding, it is striking that the prediction of right-wing orientations associated with elevated levels in D held in each and every country studied, as did the relation between D and ideological belief dimensions, with overall rather limited variance across countries. _x000D_
_x000D_
The Generality of Beliefs _x000D_
As evidenced by multiple studies both present and prior, high-D individuals tend to rely on the same set of beliefs when constructing justifications for their aversive actions as people generally do when forming judgments concerning the desired ordering of society. This is interesting insofar as the purpose of such beliefs in these contexts is theoretically distinct. In the context of D, beliefs are selfreferential and serve to construct justifications for unethical and antisocial behavior and thus maintain a positive, moral view of the self. In the context of political ideology, these beliefs form the basis of general judgments regarding others and the ordering of society at large. Thus, the results illustrate that the availability of particular beliefs for a high-D individual is not limited to the construal of one‚Äôs own actions (Hilbig et al., 2022), and arguably also extends to justifications of actions of their ingroup (e.g., Farago¬¥ et al., 2019; Tarrant et al., 2012), but implies more generalized attitudinal preferences also with respect to other individuals and groups. Whereas this is generally in line with evidence that individuals preferring intergroup inequalities do so regardless of whether their group is part of the hierarchy and even when their group is of low status (Ho et al., 2015), we would nevertheless expect D to act as a moderator of this relation, as a high-D individual should generally value their own utility more than adherence to systemic inequality. _x000D_
_x000D_
The Path From Personality to Political Orientation _x000D_
The importance of beliefs that are relied on to construct justifications for aversive behavior notwithstanding, it remains an empirically open question whether ideological beliefs temporarily precede or codetermine the development of D during the course of the life span (for a similar argument, see Bakker et al., 2021) or whether individuals inclined to maximize their utility at other‚Äôs expense tend to adopt beliefs that they deem suitable to construct justifications for aversive behavior from. Clearly, the studies presented herein were not designed to establish the causal direction between D and political orientations, even though the longitudinal setup realized in the final study at least gives some indication that the assumed direction of effects seems plausible. _x000D_
_x000D_
In a similar vein, given that the dimensions of basic personality (as per the five-factor model) have been shown to account for a substantial proportion of the genetic variance in core dimensions of ideology (Dawes & Weinschenk, 2020; Kandler et al., 2012), the high stability of D (Zettler et al., 2021), and given that initial evidence points at substantial influences of genetic and shared environmental factors in the development of D (Schermer & Jones, 2020), it seems likely that high-D individuals more readily endorse specific ideologies they are exposed to when it suits their justification needs (see also Beelmann, 2020; de Vries et al., 2022; Jahnke et al., 2022). To the extent that this reasoning is valid, this also implies that individuals inclined toward right-wing political attitudes‚Äîwho thus tend to hold corresponding beliefs‚Äîare not generally expected to exhibit high levels of aversive personality. Instead, aversive personality as per the definition of D is the conjunction between utility maximization at other‚Äôs expense and the availability of specific beliefs. A specific belief per se (i.e., independently from D) does not necessarily incur aversive behavior (Hilbig et al., 2022). _x000D_
_x000D_
Correspondingly, we would not expect individuals leaning to the political right necessarily exhibit elevated levels in aversive personality or behavior. The mere availability of specific beliefs consistent with a right-wing ideology does not imply that own utility is maximized at the expense of others. Rather, individuals with the tendency to maximize their own utility at other‚Äôs costs will adopt ‚Äúsuitable‚Äù beliefs so as to justify their behavior, and some of these beliefs happen to concur with right-wing ideology. In this regard, it must be stressed that the observed effect sizes relating D to political orientation were small to moderate in magnitude, leaving much room for individuals endorsing right-wing ideologies to show very low levels in aversive personality. _x000D_
_x000D_
The Usefulness of D Versus Specific Instances of Aversive Traits _x000D_
The results of the present studies also help to explain the previously observed heterogeneity concerning the link between more specific aversive traits and political orientations. For instance, whereas psychopathy as assessed via the respective subscale of the Short Dark Triad (Jones & Paulhus, 2014) yielded weakly positive relations to right-wing orientations in Austria (Duspara & Greitemeyer, 2017), the United Kingdom (Furnham & Horne, 2022), and the United States (Bardeen & Michel, 2019), this did not generalize to assessments of psychopathy via the Dirty Dozen (Jonason & Webster, 2010) or the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (Williams & Paulhus, 2004) in Australian (Anderson & Cheers, 2018) and Canadian (Hodson et al., 2009) samples, was only reflected in some subdimensions of the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (Patrick et al., 2009; Preston & Anestis, 2018), and yielded inconsistent patterns concerning specific subdimensions of the Psychopathic Personality Inventory-Revised (Gay et al., 2019; Lilienfeld et al., 2014) in U.S. samples. _x000D_
_x000D_
These inconsistencies are partly related to the country studied and the incoherent conceptualization of the psychopathy construct itself (e.g., Sleep et al., 2019) but also reflect that psychopathy comprises essentially nonaversive characteristics beyond its aversive component that is captured by D. In the triarchic conceptualization of psychopathy (Patrick et al., 2009), for instance, only the meanness subdimension closely corresponds to D, whereas both boldness and disinhibition are essentially nonaversive aspects that are unique to psychopathy (Bader et al., 2023). Because only some of the various components deemed to represent an aspect of psychopathy may be related to political orientation (Gay et al., 2019; Preston & Anestis, 2018), diverging results are to be expected depending on which of these components prevail in a specific measure and also depending on whether and to which extent such essentially nonaversive components are relevant for political orientations in a particular social context. Correspondingly, when the focus of interest is on the shared ‚Äúaversive essence‚Äù (Hilbig et al., 2023) of all aversive personality traits, it seems advantageous to consider D as an approach uncontaminated by nonaversive aspects, in particular, given that the D framework offers a clear theoretical delineation on why a relation to political orientation is to be expected. _x000D_
_x000D_
Limitations and Future Research _x000D_
In interpreting the results presented herein, a few limitations deserve attention. First, particularly Studies 1 and 2 did not rely on nationally representative samples, but on convenience samples, raising the possibility of self-selection bias. Indeed, individuals might have been attracted to the study via different channels across countries such as media coverage by more left-wing media in some countries and more right-wing media in other countries or by media being consumed by different age groups across countries. On a related note, there are still many countries in which we did not test the relation between D and political attitudes and orientation, although we considered >30 countries in each Studies 1 and 2. _x000D_
_x000D_
Second, we relied on a single left‚Äìright item to assess political orientation in Study 1. Whereas such a measure is widely used, it is not without criticism. Next to general psychometric issues (especially the question of reliability; Flake et al., 2017) and that interpretations of corresponding measures might be affected by the number of administered response options (Kroh, 2007), the meaning of ‚Äúleft‚Äù and ‚Äúright‚Äù might differ across countries. It has been argued that more comprehensive measures are better suited to capture political orientation, arguably especially in countries without a dominating two-party system (Demel et al., 2023). For instance, there is some evidence for a moderating effect of Western versus Eastern European country on the relations between single-item political orientation and other politically relevant constructs (Wojcik et al., 2021). Similarly, Brandt et al. (2021) reported that several measures related to political ideology were not invariant across ideology divisions in both Dutch and U.S. samples. Thus, for those more interested in the relations between aversive personality and more specific aspects of political orientation, more comprehensive measures of the latter should be applied, potentially adapted to the specific cultural context of the investigation. _x000D_
_x000D_
Next to the potential limitations of a single-item political orientation measure used across countries, socially desirable responding with regard to the D measure and/or with regard to certain beliefs cannot be ruled out. Given that individuals participated in Studies 1 and 2 for the sake of personality feedback and that Study 3 comprised several measurement occasions with several measures each (and, thus, no specific personality aspect was emphasized), we do not believe that social desirability affected our results strongly‚Äîand if at all, it most likely affected some point estimates, but not the relations between constructs at large. _x000D_

As a final limitation, we did not test the proposed mediation effects experimentally, and Studies 1 and 2 relied on cross-sectional self-report data. In combination, future research should thus aim to disentangle the assessments of aversive personality, sociopolitical attitudes and beliefs, and political orientation (as done in Study 3) and consider testing the assumed pathways in a way that allows more robust insights on causality (e.g., Bullock et al., 2010; Rohrer et al., 2022). _x000D_

Conclusion _x000D_
In summary, the present studies provided both cross-cultural and longitudinal evidence that aversive personality in terms of the D Factor of Personality has robust ties to right-wing ideologies and corresponding voting behavior. The prime mechanism responsible for this link is the availability of belief systems that are shared by those high in D (as a means to construct justifications) and those endorsing right-wing ideologies. In light of the robust association and the fact that D predicted a substantial proportion of variance in right-wing ideology beyond demographic characteristics and the entire basic personality space, it seems worthwhile to consider (the core of) aversive personality in future studies on personality influences on political orientation._x000D_","Political orientation reflects beliefs, opinions, and values that are, at least in part, rooted in stable interindividual differences. Whereas evidence has accumulated with regard to the relevance of basic personality dimensions, especially concerning the sociocultural dimension of political ideology, less attention has been paid to the more specific dispositional tendency to assign a higher weight to one‚Äôs own utility above others‚Äô (i.e., socially aversive personality), which is likely to play a pivotal role concerning the economic dimension of political ideology in particular. In three studies with over 66,000 participants from 38 countries, we show that individuals with elevated levels in aversive personality tend to endorse more right-wing political orientations in terms of a single left‚Äìright dimension, hold relevant ideological beliefs tied to both sociocultural and economic conservatism, and report corresponding electoral voting behavior. We further provide support for the idea that this overlap between a dispositional tendency toward aversive behavior and a right-wing political orientation can be attributed to shared belief systems.","1",1,"1","Political",2,1

Ethnic identity centrality across the adult lifespan: Aging, cohort, and period effects among majority and minority group members. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 127(3), 684‚Äì701.","Ethnicity is the main axis of differentiation and identification for many people across social, political, and historical contexts. Indeed, ethnic identity structures relationships at the national and local levels, in organizations and institutions, in intergroup relations, and in everyday interactions and is important to many people‚Äôs sense of self (Verkuyten, 2018). However, we do not know whether, how, and why ethnic identity changes across the adult lifespan (Maehler, 2022). To our knowledge, the present study is the first to provide valuable insights into this development among both ethnic majority and disadvantaged minority members. Specifically, we used 13 annual waves of longitudinal data from a large nationwide random sample of European majority group adults and Indigenous Ma¬Øori minority group adults in New Zealand to examine aging, cohort, and period effects on the key dimension of ethnic identity centrality (Ashmore et al., 2004; Leach et al., 2008). _x000D_
_x000D_
The first important result to emerge from this research is that the aging, period, and cohort models all fit our data well. Thus, a combination of all three processes shapes the development of ethnic identity centrality across the adult lifespan. That is, both normative aging processes and societal changes likely influence the importance that individuals attach to their ethnic identity. Notably, these patterns emerged for both ethnic majority and minority group members. These results corroborate a developmental social identity perspective, which argues that social identities emerge through the interconnection between individual psychology and the historical and contemporary societal environment (Reicher et al., 2010; Spears, 2011). _x000D_
_x000D_
Although our results identified some notable similarities in the growth trajectories of ethnic identity centrality for New Zealand Europeans and Ma¬Øori, some differences between the majority and minority group samples also emerged. These involve, first, the expected higher levels of ethnic identity centrality among the minority group sample. Much research has found that disadvantaged ethnic minority groups tend to have stronger ethnic identities (see Verkuyten, 2018), and our results demonstrate for the first time that this is the case for all ages and among different generations. These results may reflect minority group discrimination processes (e.g., Branscombe et al., 1999) but also cultural differences between Europeans and Ma¬Øori. Indeed, a cornerstone of Ma¬Øori culture entails reflecting on one‚Äôs whakapapa (genealogy) by understanding where one comes from. Such a focus on whakapapa may highlight one‚Äôs ethnic identity to a greater extent than for the European majority population. _x000D_
_x000D_
Second, for both samples, a small, but significant, aging effect emerged. These results demonstrate that change in different domains of social identity, including ethnic group belonging, is not restricted to adolescence and early adulthood but occurs throughout the adult lifespan (Fadjukoff, Feldt, et al., 2016; Maehler, 2022). Furthermore, in both samples, ethnic identity centrality was highest in the oldest age groups. However, the trajectories of change differed across groups. Indeed, centrality began to increase around the early 40s continuing into older age among the European majority, whereas it tended to increase in the younger (albeit not the youngest) years and displayed stability in older age for the Indigenous minority sample. The result for the majority sample corroborates research on ethnic identity among an adult majority sample in Germany (Maehler, 2022) and corresponds to lower openness to experience and a higher need for closure, conservatism, authoritarianism, and ethnic outgroup prejudice among older majority members (e.g., Coenders & Scheepers, 2008; Milojev & Sibley, 2017; Ruffman et al., 2016; Zubielevitch et al., 2023). The typical social role transitions (e.g., parenthood, house ownership, permanent employment) and physiological and mental changes that occur as people age may increase older people‚Äôs desire for greater security and social conformity, which can strengthen the emphasis on their ethnic group belonging as a protective barrier (Hogg, 2007). _x000D_
_x000D_
However, this change in older age can also reflect the impact of different experiences during the formative years of identity because cohort differences in ethnic identity centrality emerged for older birth cohorts of both majority European and Indigenous Ma¬Øori minority participants. These different formative experiences may be due to societal changes that occurred during participants‚Äô early years. One such example was the unprecedented and rapid urbanization of Ma¬Øori during the latter half of the 20th century, which changed the resultant communities in myriad ways. Indeed, this transition affected not only those who moved but also those who were left behind and those whose communities they joined. Furthermore, the rapid movement affected cultural bonds and laid the foundations for changes in ethnic identity as different communities were forced to engage and embrace integration. The Hunn report, published in 1960, brought these disparities to light and became one of the most pivotal documents of Pa¬Økeha¬Ø‚ÄìMa¬Øori relations in the nation‚Äôs history. With a focus on the survival of Ma¬Øori through integration into an emerging New Zealand culture, the report documented inequities between Ma¬Øori and their European counterparts in health, housing, education, employment, and crime, thereby revealing the marginalized status of Indigenous Ma¬Øori. It was during this time that social movements began to emerge, offering the marginalized minority community a voice through the establishment of new groups to advocate for social justice. In essence, these cohorts matured when there was an increased discourse about the cultural and economic differences between the European majority and the Indigenous Ma¬Øori minority (Derby, 2011). Thus, although older Ma¬Øori cohorts may have shown higher levels of ethnic identity centrality because of the discrimination and increased social discourse about inequalities and injustices they experienced during their formative years, for the European majority, these increases may be due to the higher salience of their privileged status during their formative years. _x000D_
_x000D_
Despite the similar cohort effect among both ethnic groups, some small differences emerged in the trajectories of Europeans and Ma¬Øori within the same birth cohorts; there was also a different age pattern for the Indigenous minority sample. Specifically, Ma¬Øori participants of different birth cohorts reported an increase in the importance they placed on belonging to their ethnic minority group until around middle adulthood, after which their ethnic identity centrality stabilized. One interpretation of these findings is that one‚Äôs ethnic minority background is more relevant during younger adulthood when people typically try to start a family, find stable employment, buy a house, and, in general, find a meaningful place in society. Due to racism and discrimination, these social roles and life transitions are likely to be more challenging and difficult for ethnic minority adults, thereby making their ethnic identity a more salient and central aspect of their sense of self. Minority adults might also be more aware of, and concerned about, institutional and everyday forms of racism and discrimination, thereby strengthening their ethnic minority identity (Branscombe et al., 1999; Dalton, 2016; Gil de Z√∫√±iga et al., 2021). _x000D_
_x000D_
In addition to age and cohort effects, period effects emerged for both Europeans and Ma¬Øori. Specifically, most birth cohorts displayed the same change in ethnic identity centrality between 2009 and 2021: a small decrease in centrality among the European majority sample and a small curvilinear change among the Indigenous minority sample. These similarities in within-cohort changes hint at the impact of societal developments and shifts that occurred during the 13 annual waves in which these longitudinal data were collected. During this assessment period, European majority group members tended to attach somewhat less importance to their ethnic identity potentially due to changing social norms about the acceptability of majority group ethnic identification. On the other hand, Indigenous minority group members demonstrated an increase in ethnic identity centrality up to around 2015, followed by a temporary decrease and subsequent increase. These changes over the 13 annual assessments could be due to numerous factors including the change from a center-right coalitional government (2008‚Äì2017) to a center-left coalitional government (2017‚Äì2023). Changes in the importance attached to one‚Äôs ethnic group belonging may have also been due to contemporary ethnic-based social movements that gained national attention starting in 2015 (e.g., Ihumatao occupation; Hancock & Newton, 2022) and increased incorporation of Ma¬Øori perspectives and bicultural awareness in educational, workplace, and governmental settings. _x000D_

Limitations and Future Research _x000D_
The present study provides novel and valuable insights into how ethnic identity centrality develops across the adult lifespan among ethnic majority and minority members. The large, longitudinal data set provided the unique opportunity to examine aging, cohort, and period effects, all three of which shaped the development of ethnic identity centrality. In addition to identifying similarities in the development of ethnic identity centrality between the ethnic majority and minority group participants, some interesting differences emerged. Although it will be challenging to collect similar large-scale data in future studies, we will discuss three limitations of our analyses that provide directions for further research. _x000D_
_x000D_
First, we focused on the importance attached to ethnic identity but did not consider other dimensions such as private regard, affective ties, or sense of interdependence (Ashmore et al., 2004). Centrality of ingroup membership for an individual‚Äôs overall sense of self has a long history in scientific approaches to the self, is specified as a key dimension in almost all multidimensional models of group identity, is sensitive to social circumstances, and is a key aspect that correlates with other identity aspects (Ashmore et al., 2004; Cameron, 2004; Leach et al., 2008; Sellers et al., 1998). However, it remains to be seen whether the development of other identity dimensions will show similar aging, cohort, and period effects. For example, the affective aspects of identity (e.g., emotional attachment, pride, satisfaction) may be more resistant to change after the adolescent formative years resulting in stronger cohort effects and weaker aging and period effects. Following developmental research (Crocetti et al., 2022; Maehler, 2022; Phinney, 1989), future studies could also examine changes in ethnic identity status during adulthood by focusing on the combination of the identity formation processes of exploration (efforts to learn more about one‚Äôs ethnic group) and commitment (positive affirmation of, and a strong sense of belonging to, one‚Äôs ethnic group). _x000D_
_x000D_
Second, our results provide the critical foundations for future studies by demonstrating the combined importance of aging, cohort, and period effects. However, we were unable to examine possible factors and mechanisms underlying these effects. We have offered some possible explanations and interpretations, but these data do not allow us to test specific processes and the role of societal circumstances during the formative years (or in a given period). Relatedly, effect sizes across the aging, cohort, and period models were small, which, while unsurprising when examining complex phenomena like ethnic identity centrality (see G√∂tz et al., 2022), suggests a need to examine other precursors to ethnic identity centrality outside the scope of our present analyses. It might be possible to collect macro data on societal circumstances that theoretically affect ethnic identity centrality, such as rate of immigration, level of ethnic competition, and changing societal discourses on ethnicity and diversity (Coenders & Scheepers, 2008). Yet, such an examination faces various methodological problems, including the availability of reliable (historical) data and ascertaining whether all relevant historical and contemporary societal circumstances are considered (Firebaugh, 1997). _x000D_
_x000D_
Third, there are some methodological limitations that must be considered. For example, our results cannot completely disentangle aging from cohort effects, which would require a lifetime of data from participants‚Äîan endeavor that is impossible in practice. However, we were able to estimate changes in multiple birth cohorts over 13 annual assessments, which, in our view, provide a unique and clear picture of the changes in ethnic identity centrality. Further, disentangling aging versus cohort effects would require similar analyses among various ethnic groups and in other countries. For example, if ethnic identity development is largely an aging process, then we should expect similar trends across ethnic groups and across countries that differ in societal circumstances and that have a different history of interethnic relations than New Zealand. Our results reveal some differences between ethnic majority and minority groups, suggesting that social circumstances do matter. Additionally, for examining the role of aging processes and changing societal conditions, future longitudinal research might consider ethnic identity centrality among different generations of immigrant-origin groups (Caron et al., 2023; Feliciano & Rumbaut, 2019).5 _x000D_

Conclusion _x000D_
In conclusion, this study is the first to systematically examine changes in ethnic identity centrality in adulthood among ethnic majority and minority group members. Our comprehensive coverage of age groups is unique in the literature and helps to increase our understanding of how ethnic identity centrality is affected by societal circumstances and develops over time among ethnic majority and minority group members. The series of cohort-sequential latent growth models demonstrate that there are aging, period, and cohort effects in ethnic identity centrality. Thus, the extent to which individuals consider their ethnic identity to be an important part of their self-concept is informed by a combination of normative aging processes and societal circumstances that reflect the unique historical context in which people formed their ethnic identities, as well as social changes during the 13 annual assessments of our study. Ethnic identity is formed in a specific time frame during adolescence with its rapid biological, cognitive, emotional, and social changes but is never ‚Äúfinished‚Äù (Uma√±a-Taylor et al., 2014). Indeed, ethnic identity centrality undergoes continual change throughout adulthood and in response to societal events and shifts, which prompt adults to reconsider the importance and meaning that they attach to their group (Crocetti et al., 2022). Our results demonstrate that the development of ethnic identity is a lifelong task in which aging, early formative experiences, and current social events all have a unique role to play._x000D_","Ethnic identity is a major area of study across many disciplines including psychology, sociology, anthropology, and political science. Yet, little is known about changes in ethnic identity across the adult lifespan, and whether such changes are driven by normal aging processes (aging effects), unique societal influences linked with one‚Äôs formative years (cohort effects), or social changes during a specific time frame (period effects). We address these key oversights by utilizing 13 annual waves of longitudinal panel data from a nationwide random sample of both ethnic majority (N = 49,660) and Indigenous ethnic minority (N = 8,325) group members in New Zealand to examine changes in ethnic identity centrality using cohort-sequential latent growth modeling. This approach helps to identify changes in mean levels of ethnic identity centrality over time and whether such changes are driven by aging, cohort, and/or period effects. Our data reveal that, among both ethnic majority and ethnic minority individuals, changes in ethnic identity centrality were informed by a combination of normative aging processes, societal circumstances that reflected the unique historical context in which people grew to maturity, and societal changes during the 13 annual assessments of our study. Collectively, these results demonstrate for the first time that ethnic identity centrality in adulthood is subject to lifelong changes.","1",0,"1","Political",4,1
85,14,"Ko, A., Neuberg, S. L., Pick, C. M., Varnum, M. E., & Becker, D. V. (2024). Responses to political partisans are shaped by a COVID-19-sensitive disease avoidance psychology: A longitudinal investigation of functional flexibility. American Psychologist.","Employing a longitudinal design, we examined a theoretically important hypothesis concerning the functional flexibility of disease avoidance psychology. We found that (a) Americans used others‚Äô political affiliations as a novel diagnostic cue for potential infection threats during the COVID-19 pandemic; (b) beyond strong ingroup favoritism/outgroup derogation biases, participants with a dispositionally stronger motivation to avoid disease showed greater infection management responses toward Republicans than Democrats, a finding that held also for Republican participants (between-person functional flexibility); (c) beyond those strong dispositional between-person effects, participants who sensitively upregulated their disease avoidance motivation during the rapid spread of COVID-19 reported greater infection management responses toward Republicans than Democrats, again, even for Republican participants (within-person functional flexibility); and (d) at both between-person and within-person levels, the experience of disgust played a significant role of statistically mediating between cognitive and behavioral infection management responses. _x000D_
_x000D_
Because people cannot perceive pathogens directly, they must be vigilant for known cues diagnostic of infection (e.g., skin rashes, coughing, hygiene habits) and be able to discover and use new cues. The COVID-19 pandemic provided a new set of diagnostic cues‚Äîexpressed opposition to actions that reduce one‚Äôs likelihood of infecting others. Because opposition to such behaviors was highly correlated with political party affiliation in the United States, Americans could use others‚Äô political affiliation as a novel cue to infection threat. We note that there is nothing inherent in Republican party affiliation to convey pathogen threat. Indeed, political conservatism tends to be associated with greater disease concern (Inbar et al., 2012; Terrizzi et al., 2013) and, one might thus expect, a lesser likelihood of becoming infected and thereby infecting others. In fact, the Ebola outbreak was associated with increased support for Republican candidates in the 2014 U.S. Federal elections (Beall et al., 2016). That participants identified Republican affiliation as a diagnostic cue for COVID-19 infection due to the political landscape during the pandemic, despite this countervailing general inclination, provides a strong demonstration of people‚Äôs ability to identify novel infection cues and use them to manage infection threat. The present study thus builds upon previous research (Kim et al., 2016; Makhanova, 2022) exploring how the threat of new ecological infection threat influences social learning related to disease-relevant groups. _x000D_
_x000D_
Importantly, any functional system for avoiding infection must be flexible, calibrating its responses to a person‚Äôs own vulnerability to those threats and infection risks in the environment. This calibration enables one to engage the environment in a way to access the opportunities it affords (e.g., food, social affiliation, mating) while minimizing the contraction of costly disease (Haselton & Nettle, 2006; Nesse, 2005; Schaller & Park, 2011). Consistent with this, above and beyond strong effects of in-party favoritism/ out-party derogation, participants who were dispositionally high in disease avoidance motivation‚Äîeven Republican participants‚Äîbelieved Republicans to be more likely to infect others and felt more disgust toward them. Broadly, this is in line with research showing that people who dispositionally perceived a greater threat from COVID-19 reported greater preferred social distance from foreigners (Szymkow et al., 2021) and from Asian targets in the United States during the early stage of COVID-19 (Reny & Barreto, 2020). _x000D_
_x000D_
Moreover, this study provides a theoretically critical natural demonstration of within-person functional flexibility. Withinperson upregulation in disease avoidance motivation, when the risk of COVID-19 infection was relatively high, predicted stronger beliefs that Republicans are likely to infect others and decreasesin disgust toward and avoidance of Democrats‚Äîand these effects, too, were exhibited by Republican participants. In other words, within-person increases in disease avoidance motivation predict enhanced infection management responses when it is especially important to do so. Because within-person functional flexibility is central to theories on the behavioral immune system, the current finding provides an important contribution using a unique naturalistic panel design with high ecological validity. These findings do not, however, address why those within-person shifts in disease avoidance motivation occurred in the first place. Although previous research has found that people reported a greater level of disgust sensitivity during COVID-19 compared to prepandemic times (betweenperson differences across times; Mi≈Çkowska et al., 2021; Stevenson et al., 2021), further investigations into the factors that lead individuals to upregulate disease avoidance motivation in ways sensitive to changes in ecological risk (withinperson differences across time) will be theoretically and practically important. _x000D_
_x000D_
In this study, greater disease avoidance motivation did not invariably lead to greater antipathy against outgroups. Intriguingly, we found that higher dispositional levels of disease avoidance motivation and upregulation of disease avoidance motivation during periods of elevated COVID-19 risk significantly predicted lower levels of disgust and desire to avoid Democrats, even for Republican participants. These nuanced findings suggest that a higher dispositional level of disease avoidance motivation and ecologically sensitive upregulation of disease avoidance motivation can actually lead to higher vigilance toward ingroup members while lowering vigilance against outgroup members, if the belief is that ingroup members pose the greatest infection threat (e.g., van Leeuwen & Petersen, 2018; Wu et al., 2015, 2019). _x000D_
_x000D_
Additionally, it is worth noting that the infection management responses we observed toward both Republicans and Democrats generally fell below the midpoint of the scale. This suggests that responses based on political affiliation were relatively moderate and not extreme. _x000D_
_x000D_
The present study‚Äôs sample comprises American adults during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, within a particularly polarized political environment. As a result, it is uncertain whether such findings would generalize to other societies and political systems. Nevertheless, we believe that the broader conceptualization of the findings‚Äîthat individuals can detect and adapt to novel cues to threats and that individual motivation flexibly drives threat management responses both between and within individuals‚Äîis likely to apply to other populations, time periods, and social contexts. _x000D_
_x000D_
It is worth noting that although we observed a significant interaction between within-person variation in disease avoidance motivation (Level 1) and ecological infection threat, as hypothesized, we did not find support for an interaction between between-person differences in disease avoidance motivation (Level 2) and ecological infection threat‚Äîas one might expect from the literature. Instead, our results suggest that irrespective of variations in the actual ecological disease threat across six waves, individuals‚Äô average disease avoidance motivation level during the pandemic (Level 2) predicted a stronger infection management response toward Republicans than Democrats. One limitation to observing such an interaction may be that we began measuring dispositional disease avoidance motivation only after the onset of the pandemic. _x000D_
_x000D_
Last, this study employed self-reported measures of disease avoidance motivation, beliefs about infection risk, and behavioral intention. Self-report measures are often subject to response biases that may alter interpretations of findings; in this case, however, the interactive nature of the observed effects lessens the concern that the observed findings are the result of any simple forms of response bias. That said, future research might consider using more objective measures of avoidance behavior, such as observed public social distancing and mask-wearing. _x000D_
_x000D_
In sum, these findings provide evidence that people appear to acquire, track, and employ novel cues to manage potential threats, in this case, political party affiliation during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The current longitudinal data further provide evidence for within-person flexibility in infection management, a process long presumed and now demonstrated. Importantly, this within-person flexibility was observed above and beyond strong effects of ingroup/outgroup political prejudices and the effects of between-person differences in disease avoidance strategies. These findings, together, highlight the functional flexibility of people as they seek to identify and manage threats._x000D_","How do natural changes in disease avoidance motivation shape thoughts about and behaviors toward ingroup and outgroup members? During the COVID-19 pandemic, political party affiliation has been a strong predictor in the United States of COVID-19-related opinions, attitudes, and behaviors. Using a six-wave longitudinal panel survey of representative Americans (on Prolific, N = 1,124, from April 2020 to February 2021), we explored how naturally occurring changes across time in both risks of COVID-19 infection and people‚Äôs disease avoidance motivation shaped thoughts about and behaviors toward Republicans and Democrats (e.g., perceived infection threat, feelings of disgust, desires to avoid). We found a significant effect of dispositional level of motivation, over and above powerful effects of in-party favoritism/out-party derogation: Participants with a dispositionally stronger motivation to avoid disease showed greater infection management responses, especially toward Republicans; this held even for Republican participants. More importantly, we also found a significant interactive effect of within-person variability and ecological infection risk: Participants who sensitively upregulated their motivation during the rapid spread of COVID-19 perceived greater infection threat by Republicans and felt less disgust toward and desire to avoid Democrats. This finding, too, held for Republican participants. These results provide evidence of functionally flexible within-person psychological disease avoidance‚Äîa theoretically important process long presumed and now demonstrated‚Äîand suggest another mechanism contributing to U.S. political polarization.","4",0,"4","Political",4,0

The Whiteness pandemic behind the racism pandemic: Familial Whiteness socialization in Minneapolis following #GeorgeFloyd‚Äôs murder. American Psychologist, 77(3), 344‚Äì361.","The purpose of this study was to unveil the Whiteness pandemic lurking behind the racism pandemic by examining Whiteness socialization in a large U.S. sample of White families in and around Minneapolis in the month following the murder of an unarmed Black resident, Mr. George Floyd, by a White policer officer on May 25, 2020. This mixed methods study achieved strong convergent validity across methods‚Äîafter controlling for age, qualitatively derived White racial identity development (WRID) phase was significantly associated with quantitative scores on multicultural acquisition and ethnic protectiveness, but not income or education. Findings largely supported expectations with medium effect sizes for quantitative analyses, and demonstrated the interlocking facets of the p-model of culture applied to Whiteness (Causadias, 2020). Our complementary qualitative and quantitative findings aligned with Helms (1984, 2017) WRID theory in that participants who were racially silent (i.e., no mention of Floyd‚Äôs murder or subsequent events in response to open-ended questions) were significantly less oriented toward multiculturalism, and among those who were racially responsive, those with less advanced WRID (Helms‚Äô Phase 1) had a significantly weaker orientation toward multiculturalism and a significantly more protective stance toward their racial/ethnic group relative to more advanced participants (Helms‚Äô Phase 2). Thematic analyses revealed many more differences than similarities between less advanced and more advanced parents in their Whiteness socialization beliefs/values, attitudes, practices, and emotions. A discussion of each major finding follows with implications and recommendations. _x000D_
_x000D_
Beliefs and Values: Color- and Power-Evasiveness Versus Color- and Power-Consciousness _x000D_
Our findings evidence the widespread presence of CBRI in White mothers despite the recent calls from researchers (e.g., Roberts & Rizzo, 2020) and also the general public (BLM: Buchanan et al., 2020; Parents magazine: Carter, 2020) to abandon this ideology and move toward active antiracist beliefs in parenting values. Specifically, the majority of our sample was either completely silent on race, Floyd, and community events subsequent to his murder (qualitative) with a significantly lower orientation toward multicultural (quantitative), or were racially responsive in ways that did not recognize the systemic nature of racism or White privilege, mention BLM, or value proactive parenting to handle racial stimuli (qualitative). Moreover, these forms of parental evasiveness were not explained by child age: Color- and power-consciousness was evident in parents of younger and older children. This is certainly a frustrating and exhausting reality, primarily for the Black community that endures continued daily harm from overt (higher police use of force) and covert systemic racism (passive bystander behavior, negative health impact of discrimination), and, secondarily, for White mothers with more advanced WRID who observe these markers of lacking racial progress. _x000D_
_x000D_
Although the Whiteness pandemic includes both passive and active transmission of CBRI, effective prevention or intervention must be active. Suggested strategies for dismantling CBRI start with racism and antiracism education. Courses on racism and diversity can be offered not just in college but also at younger ages to decrease racism across White students, who are the next generation of White parents (see Neville et al., 2013 for review). Such education targeting parents could be implemented by city-based community education programming or university-based research, intervention, or extension centers. Meaningful interracial interactions, including those fostered through BLM engagement, can also reduce CBRI in White individuals (see Neville et al., 2013), but future research is needed to uncover what it is about those interactions that increases racial awareness in White individuals. Relatedly, research needs to shift away from examining how people become racist to how people become antiracist (Roberts & Rizzo, 2020). Our article examined factors related to White parents‚Äô WRID‚Äîfuture research efforts can uncover the exact processes by which such individuals progress toward more advanced WRID. It will be important to go beyond how White women learn to say the right things to also consider how they learn to do the right things and actually ‚Äúshow up‚Äù for racial justice (see Tropp & Ulug, 2019 in Supplement A). _x000D_
_x000D_
Attitudes: Less Effective Versus More Effective Coping Style _x000D_
Racial injustice and social unrest are very troubling realities and so attentiveness, stress, and distractedness are quite appropriate emotional responses such as we saw across our sample. However, White mothers with less advanced WRID demonstrated a less effective coping style evidenced by higher stress and perceived threat, an external depersonalized present-oriented stance, and a nervous protective emotional state, possibly motivated by their greater desire for ethnic group protection. This contrasts with the more effective and agentic coping style of the more advanced group characterized by lower stress and higher positivity, and an internal personalized future-oriented stance, possibly motivated by their greater desire to embrace multiculturalism. It is particularly noteworthy that less advanced mothers, regardless of geography, viewed themselves as outsiders to the problem of police brutality and systemic racial oppression. This is indeed a critical part of the Whiteness pandemic‚Äîsocializing children to view themselves as outsiders and their actions as disconnected from systemic oppression. Additionally, phase-specific emotions aligned closely with Spanierman and Cabrera (2014) summary of racist and antiracist emotions: less advanced mothers displayed racist emotions of White apathy and fear, whereas more advanced mothers displayed antiracist emotions of White empathy (e.g., sadness/grief) and autopathy (e.g., visiting the Floyd memorial to more fully experience the horror), moral outrage, and hope. Coping style differences across WRID phases are likely to be linked to more general stress and coping differences. Less advanced mothers may appraise racerelated police murders and similar injustices as uncontrollable, whereas more advanced mothers are more likely to view them as controllable‚Äîcaused by certain actors, including themselves, and changeable by certain actions in which they are motivated to participate (Rochford & Blocker, 1991). Less advanced mothers also showed more emotion-focused coping relative to their more advanced peers who showed more problem-focused coping, both of which are known to relate negatively and positively, respectively, with activism after a disaster (Rochford & Blocker, 1991). Mothers used a similar coping style with COVID-19 pandemic: Less advanced mothers were overwhelmed by it, whereas more advanced mothers capitalized on COVID-19 quarantine space and time to reflect and grow (e.g., ‚ÄúAnd I think the pandemic has provided space to realize that and make way for change‚Äù: ID123, more advanced). _x000D_
_x000D_
White individuals‚Äô stress can abound when discussing race. To work against the White fragility they might feel in these situations, it is essential for them to move beyond simplistic awareness of racism to a more agentic stance of action and dismantling racist systems (DiAngelo, 2018). White parents also need to resist defensiveness and complacency, be open to feedback, and focus on the impact of their parenting actions, not just their intentions (DiAngelo, 2018). Helms (2017) also recommends that psychologists‚Äî both researchers and practitioners in our view‚Äîshould focus on self-exploration of Whiteness, not just race and racism, and self-diagnose their own racial identity schemas to better understand and approach their work. _x000D_

Practices: Avoidant/Passive/Incidental Versus Approach/Active/Purposeful _x000D_
Floyd‚Äôs murder and subsequent events likely promoted racial dissonance for many White Americans. For those with less advanced WRID in our sample, this may have been the first major encounter that pierced through their shielded bubbles by hitting close to their physical homes (e.g., whirring helicopter blades, neighborhood fires). Supporting this interpretation, the farther away the unrest was from their homes, the more White parents could employ avoidance, passivity, and White silence in their parenting (e.g., ‚ÄúWe live far enough away from the community unrest that I have not yet explained this to my daughter‚Äù: ID145). Additionally, less advanced parents were novices in considering racism‚Äîmany reported acquiring first/ new knowledge after Floyd‚Äôs murder. They were likely reticent to include race-related information in socializing their children as they themselves had not yet digested it nor learned that speaking of race does make one racist and will not produce racial bias in children. Importantly, reticence can transform to complicity in systems of White supremacy in the absence of development of more advanced parental racial identity (Helms, 2017; Roberts & Rizzo, 2020). This contrasts with more advanced White parents for whom parental racial dissonance catalyzed growth in White racial identity development and change efforts‚Äîfor some this meant advancing from Helms (2017) Phase 1 to Phase 2, meaning a transition from mere knowledge of racism to reckoning with its systemic nature and/ or deciding to engage with antiracist actions in parental socialization efforts. _x000D_
_x000D_
For White parents, engaging in color-conscious and powerconscious conversations is optional, or even discouraged by the Whiteness pandemic, so most choose not to do so, an attestation of their power and privilege (Underhill, 2019). Resisting the dominant practices of Whiteness will require researchers, educators, and parents to engage in difficult conversations and improve the racial-ethnic socialization of White children. Proactively engaging White individuals in discussions about racism could help them think more introspectively about the topic (e. g., understand their own privilege or complicity in racism) and perhaps prepare them for future difficult conversations around such topics as police brutality by raising their racial stamina (DiAngelo, 2018; Hall et al., 2016). Schooley et al. (2019) focus specifically on how research can advance in this area by considering more modern forms of racism and CBRI present in White individuals, something not captured by all measures used in the literature. Other scholars suggest that intervening at the family level could be advantageous‚Äîif parents are encouraged to teach their children about color-conscious ideology and receive scaffolding to do so effectively, they could themselves become less biased (Abaied & Perry, 2021). For example, Vittrup (2018) noted that parents can work to use more specific (vs. vague) language to communicate race-related information. These discussions have long been essential parenting in Black families, and while they may be new and awkward for White parents, they are equally essential to breaking patterns of racialized power structures and systemic harm. _x000D_

Limitations and Future Directions _x000D_
This study was limited in some ways that can guide future research. First, we purposefully captured a snapshot of Whiteness socialization immediately following Floyd‚Äôs murder during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, future studies following race-related events not constrained by pandemic realities can employ longitudinal methodologies to assess the degree to which these socialization features are sustained/transform over time. This study focuses on mothers because very few fathers participated; however, mothers are often primary socializers around emotion and communication (Eisenberg et al., 1998). Additionally, future work should examine mothers‚Äô own interracial friendships based on their established importance in maternal racial socialization in previous work (see Pahlke et al., 2012) in Supplement A. Our sample included largely middle/ upper income liberals because this is the specific demographic most impacted by the Whiteness pandemic in Minnesota and the United States generally; therefore, the results may not generalize to Whites from other socioeconomic status/political brackets. This study focused on racial silence and passivism, major features of the Whiteness pandemic; therefore, no explicit interrogation of race was done in qualitative open-ended questions. This was an asset rather than a liability and provides a complement to other studies explicitly focusing on racism and antiracism in samples of parents who self-identify as antiracist. However, oversampling self-identified antiracist parents may provide more power to detect small effects below .08. _x000D_

Conclusion _x000D_
Color-evasion and power-evasion‚Äîthe central pathogens of the Whiteness pandemic‚Äîare inexorably transmitted within families. White parents serve as carriers to their children of this colorblind racial ideology unless they take active preventative measures rooted in antiracism and equity-promotion._x000D_","Family socialization into the centuries-old culture of Whiteness‚Äîinvolving colorblindness, passivity, and fragility‚Äîperpetrates and perpetuates U.S. racism, reflecting an insidious Whiteness pandemic. As a poignant case study, this mixed methods study examined Whiteness socialization among White mothers (N = 392, M = 37.99 years, SD = 4.34) in Minneapolis, Minnesota in the month following the May 2020 police killing of unarmed Black resident, George Floyd. Using Helms‚Äô (1984, 2017) White racial identity development theory (WRID), content analyses of qualitative responses classified participants into lower versus higher levels of WRID, after which thematic analyses compared their Whiteness socialization beliefs/values, attitudes, practices, and emotions, and analyses of variance compared their demographics, multiculturalism, and psychological distress. There was strong convergence across qualitative and quantitative findings and results aligned with the WRID model. Racially silent participants (i.e., no mention of Floyd‚Äôs murder or subsequent events on open-ended questions: 53%) had lower multiculturalism scores and lower psychological distress. Among mothers who were racially responsive (i.e., mentioned Floyd‚Äôs murder or subsequent events: 47%), those with more advanced WRID (17%) had higher multiculturalism scores; lower ethnic group protectiveness scores; a more effective coping style featuring empathy, moral outrage, and hope; more color- and power-conscious socialization beliefs/values; and more purposeful racial socialization practices than their less advanced peers (30%). Collectively, color-evasion and power-evasion‚Äîpathogens of the Whiteness pandemic‚Äîare inexorably transmitted within families, with White parents serving as carriers to their children unless they take active preventive measures rooted in antiracism and equity-promotion.","1",0,"1","Political",2,0

Nature Human Behaviour, 1-15.","We found suggestive evidence (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) for our first primary hypothesis that final decision market prices correlate with replication outcomes (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.505). However, the estimated effect size is somewhat smaller than the effect size of r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.67, as presumed in our a priori power calculations (see Methods for details). The estimated correlation is within the range of previous prediction markets on systematic replication projects with correlations of 0.42 in the RPP10,15, 0.30 in the EERP16 and 0.84 in the SSRP17, but we expected a stronger correlation because we selected studies with the highest and the lowest prices for replication. Consistent with the primary hypothesis test, there is also suggestive evidence of a difference in the replication rate between the ‚Äòtop-12‚Äô (10 of 12) and ‚Äòbottom-12‚Äô (4 of 12) in our secondary hypothesis test. The difference of 50 percentage points is also reflected in the difference between the forecasted replication rates of 86.6% (‚Äòtop-12‚Äô) versus 29.6% (‚Äòbottom-12‚Äô) in the decision market. However, the small sample size suggests caution against drawing firm conclusions about whether decision markets are appropriate for selecting studies for replication._x000D_
_x000D_
The pooled evidence from previous prediction market studies on replication outcomes suggests that markets are somewhat more accurate than surveys45, although the difference tends to be small. These indications are consistent with our results, yielding suggestive evidence of higher accuracy in terms of the absolute prediction error but not in terms of the squared prediction error (although, as noted above, failing to reject the null hypothesis for the squared prediction error does not imply that the null hypothesis is true). The estimated correlation between the average survey beliefs and the replication outcomes was almost as high for the survey as the prediction market (0.476 versus 0.505). The decision market prices and survey beliefs are also highly correlated with each other (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.9). Since surveys are less resource intensive, simple polls can be an expedient alternative to decision markets for selecting which studies to replicate, even if they should be somewhat less accurate. Another potential method for selecting which studies to replicate would be to rely on the original P value for studies reporting statistically significant results45. Although the prediction accuracy appears to be somewhat lower for original P values than market and survey forecasts45, relying on P values may well be considered a practical alternative as it does not involve any additional data collection. Another possibility would be to use predicted replication probabilities from machine learning models to select studies for replication. There has been some progress in developing such models120,121,122,123, but evidence on whether they outperform markets or surveys is yet missing. Other potential mechanisms for selecting which studies to replicate include relying on general or study-specific characteristics (for example, connection to theory, surprise factor, sample size, effect size and importance)25,26,27,28, relying on cost‚Äìbenefit considerations29,30, using Bayesian strategies31,32, determining the ‚Äòreplication value‚Äô33, adopting empirical audit and review34, selecting studies randomly35 or using predictions from laypeople36,37._x000D_
_x000D_
Using decision markets to select the studies with the highest and lowest predicted probabilities for replication is just one of the many potential selection rules for this methodology. Our goal was to test whether a decision market could distinguish findings that would replicate or not, and we aimed to maximize the statistical power of detecting an association between market prices and replication outcomes. For the practical application of decision markets, the choice of the selection mechanism will largely depend on the objective function. One selection rule would be to choose the studies with the highest predicted false positive likelihood, that is, the studies with the smallest market prices (in addition to at least one randomly selected study to ensure incentive compatibility). This decision mechanism would align with the objective of identifying and correcting false discoveries in the literature to facilitate an efficient allocation of resources for follow-up investigations. Another selection rule would be to replicate the studies with market predictions close to 50%, which reflects the highest possible uncertainty or disagreement regarding the likelihood of the original finding being genuinely true. Providing additional evidence on these claims could maximize the information value of replication studies, as well-powered replications will move the probability that the tested hypothesis is genuinely true towards 0% or 100%._x000D_
_x000D_
For our second primary hypothesis, we found strong evidence that original effect sizes are inflated on average compared with replication effect sizes, with a relative estimated average effect size of 45%. This is comparable to previous systematic replication studies, with relative average effect size estimates of 49% in the RPP15, 59% in the EERP14 and 54% in the SSRP17. The replication rate of 54% based on the statistical significance indicator is also similar to previous replication studies, with 36% in the RPP15, 61% in the EERP14 and 62% in the SSRP17. Caution should be exercised when comparing the replication results across these studies: the number of replications in each of the projects is small, only one focal result per paper has been selected for replication, and the particular journals and time periods considered differ. However, the results of all these studies are consistent with a replication rate of about 50% for both the binary statistical significance indicator and the continuous relative effect size indicator; compatible replication results have also been observed in the Many Labs replication projects12,13,14._x000D_
_x000D_
The ability of the statistical significance indicator to discriminate between true positives and false positives depends on replication power, and the relative average effect size of the studies that failed to replicate should be close to zero if the systematic replication study successfully separates false positives from true positives. The relative average estimated effect size of the 12 studies that failed to replicate according to the statistical significance indicator was 3.2%, which is close to zero and consistent with a successful separation between true positives and false positives. But also true positive findings can be expected to have exaggerated effect sizes in the published literature owing to a lack of statistical power18,19. In line with this, we found an estimated average effect size of 69.5% for the 14 studies that were successfully replicated based on the statistical significance indicator. These findings are consistent with similar analyses in the SSRP17 in which the estimated mean relative effect size among the studies that failed to replicate according to the statistical significance indicator was 0.3%, and the estimated mean relative effect size among the studies that replicated successfully was 73.1%. This illustrates how the combination of statistical significance and relative effect size can contribute to revealing possible false positives and true positives with exaggerated effect sizes._x000D_
_x000D_
Previous systematic replication studies have focused on laboratory experiments rather than online experiments. Concerns have been raised over data quality in online data collections using ‚Äòcrowd workers‚Äô, as via MTurk88,89,90,91,92,93,94, and part of the rationale for zeroing in on experiments conducted via MTurk was that we tend to share these concerns. However, the results of this study do not suggest that replicability is substantively lower for experiments conducted via MTurk compared with experiments conducted in physical laboratories for studies published in top journals; more evidence is needed to draw strong conclusions. Relatedly, the predicted average replicability rate of 57.6% in the decision market‚Äîdespite widespread concerns about data quality on MTurk‚Äîis within the range of replication rate forecasts in previous prediction markets of 56% in the RPP10, 75% in the EERP16 and 63% in the SSRP17. We used IP quality checks90,124 to minimize the chances of low-quality participant data (see Methods for details), screening out participants before the random assignment into treatments. In total, across all 26 replications, 29% of the participants who accepted a ‚Äòhuman intelligence task‚Äô (HIT) failed the IP check and were excluded (this descriptive result was not preregistered; see Methods for further details). The replication results from our study should thus not be extrapolated to MTurk experiments not using a comparable screening procedure. An important caveat is that although our IP quality checks seem to have been effective in filtering out bots, this may not be the case for artificial responses generated by large language models such as ChatGPT, which could pose a challenge for collecting data online via platforms such as MTurk125._x000D_
_x000D_
There are several important limitations to our study. A successful replication, on its own, does not provide valid evidence for the tested hypothesis. It goes without saying that inference in replication studies is subject to type-I and type-II errors, just as in original studies. Moreover, a finding can be replicable while being based on an invalid experimental design, leading to biased results. An example of this would be an experimental design that systematically results in more attrition in one experimental treatment, causing selection bias in favour of the tested conjecture88. Likewise, a failed replication, on its own, does not provide direct evidence against the tested hypothesis. A finding can be unreplicable and based on an invalid experimental design, leaving the hypothesis untested. Although the replication rate for online experiments in our study appears to be similar to previous laboratory evidence, it does not necessarily imply that online and laboratory experiments provide equally valid evidence of the tested hypotheses._x000D_
_x000D_
Another limitation is that we only replicate a single focal result per paper, and the replication outcome does not necessarily generalize to other results reported in the original articles. Furthermore, we only gathered data from one online population using the same experimental design as in the original study. It cannot be ruled out that the difference in timing between the replication studies and the original studies has affected the replication results as a consequence of changes in the composition of the MTurk subject pool or the tested phenomenon having changed over time. Large-scale, multi-site replication studies that collect data across various populations and settings, similar to the Many Labs replication projects12,13,14, qualify as a promising method to shed light on the heterogeneity of replication effect sizes across populations and designs126,127,128 in future replication work, potentially increasing the strength of evidence for whether the hypothesis supported in the original study is likely true or not. Collaborative networks such as the Psychological Science Accelerator129 facilitate multi-site replication studies and can be a door opener to large and diverse samples._x000D_
_x000D_
Another caveat in interpreting our results is the lack of agreement about how to define and measure replicability. We chose to report the results for a broad set of replication indicators proposed in the literature and leave it to readers to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of the various measures. Decision markets come with the limitation of being a relatively resource-intensive tool, rendering simple polls an appealing alternative._x000D_
_x000D_
In our proof-of-concept investigation of using decision markets to assess replicability, decision markets show potential as a tool for selecting studies for replications, but further work is needed to draw strong conclusions. The observed replication rate of social science experiments based on data collections via MTurk published in PNAS is comparable to previous systematic replication projects of experimental studies in the social sciences, primarily based on lab experiments. However, the sample size of 26 replication studies is small, implying substantial uncertainty about both the estimated replication rate and the estimated association between the decision market prices and the replication rate. Our study is also limited to one scientific journal and may not be representative of social science results based on MTurk samples published in other journals, or studies using other online platforms for the data collection. Thus, prudence should be exercised in generalizing our findings and comparing replication results across studies.","Here we test the feasibility of using decision markets to select studies for replication and provide evidence about the replicability of online experiments. Social scientists (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ162) traded on the outcome of close replications of 41 systematically selected MTurk social science experiments published in PNAS 2015‚Äì2018, knowing that the 12 studies with the lowest and the 12 with the highest final market prices would be selected for replication, along with 2 randomly selected studies. The replication rate, based on the statistical significance indicator, was 83% for the top-12 and 33% for the bottom-12 group. Overall, 54% of the studies were successfully replicated, with replication effect size estimates averaging 45% of the original effect size estimates. The replication rate varied between 54% and 62% for alternative replication indicators. The observed replicability of MTurk experiments is comparable to that of previous systematic replication projects involving laboratory experiments.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,1
88,14,"Dutton, E., van der Linden, D., & Lynn, R. (2016). The negative Flynn Effect: A systematic literature review. Intelligence, 59, 163-169.","In the present study we conducted an exhaustive literature search in order to find studies reporting a negative Flynn Effect. Based on a set of strict criteria which we detailed in the Method section, we found a series of articles reporting a decline in general IQ scores over a period of at least five years. Notably, the most useful studies were those from Norway, Denmark and Finland because they involve the vast majority of males in each annual cohort and provided clear evidence of a year-on-year negative Flynn Effect._x000D_
_x000D_
Building on the results of this systematic literature search, we discussed four possible causes of the negative Flynn Effect. First, we took into account sex ratio. We concluded that this sampling issue is very unlikely to play a role because the negative Flynn Effect can be found in samples of almost the entire male cohorts in certain countries and where we have a mixed-sex sample the sex-balance of the cohorts is roughly the same._x000D_
_x000D_
The second possibility we considered was immigration. We argued that in some samples (e.g., Finland, Dutton and Lynn, 2013, Koivunen, 2007) immigration could not entirely have caused the decline in IQ scores because the level of immigrants in those cases was too small to have any significant effect on average IQ._x000D_
_x000D_
The third option we considered was dysgenics. Unfortunately, we could not extract dysgenic data for all the countries in which we found a negative Flynn Effect. Therefore, we could not reliably analyse the relationship with IQ decline. Nevertheless, the notion that dysgenics may play a role has been suggested in several other studies. For example it would be in line with Woodley et al. (2014) who have presented evidence that reaction times have declined across the twentieth century in a number of Western countries and they show that reaction times robustly correlate with intelligence. Woodley et al.'s (2014) studies on reaction times have been heavily criticised (e.g. Woods, Wyma, Yund, et al., 2015). However, it can be countered that Woodley and others have found corroborative evidence in other proxies for IQ, such as colour discrimination (Woodley & Fernandes, 2016), meaning that the simplest explanation is that these studies are tapping into the same phenomenon. Moreover, Woodley et al. (2015) have responded to the most recent criticisms with further evidence for their case. It might also be countered that their evidence would predict IQ losses throughout the twentieth century, rather than beginning at the end of it. But, as already discussed, the argument is that these would be being covered-up by massive rises on a particular intelligence sub-ability that was partly related to g. Eventually, the ceiling of this ability would be reached and the losses would start to reveal themselves on IQ tests. In addition, Woodley and Fernandes (2016) have shown that the Flynn Effect is not primarily occurring on general and heritable intelligence factor g, whereas the negative Flynn Effect does seem to occur on g. The negative Flynn Effect displays a Jensen Effect, and is mainly occurring on the more heritable abilities (Woodley of Menie & Dunkel, 2015). We would suggest that these different lines of evidence favour Flynn's argument that the Flynn Effect is an environmental phenomenon. The more educated and science-focused modern world forces us to adopt scientific spectacles causing us to reach our phenotypic limit on certain intelligence abilities, even though g is declining due to dysgenic fertility. This shows up as a secular rise in IQ scores, cloaking the decline in g, but this has reached its limit, so the decline in g is now showing up on the IQ tests as a negative Flynn Effect._x000D_
_x000D_
Fourth, and finally, we discussed maternal age. We tested the possibility that this may play a role in intelligence decline, but the direct correlation between IQ decline and the country's average maternal age was negative (‚àí 0.88). Thus, at this stage, maternal age is not persuasive as an argument for the IQ decline._x000D_
_x000D_
In the present study, we must emphasize that even though we identified several studies showing a decline in IQ, there is currently still a much larger pool of studies showing an increase in IQ. For example, Flynn (2012) has reported a positive Flynn Effect in the USA among adults between 1995 and 2001 of 3.06 points per decade, when comparing the WISC III and the WISC IV. Among US children, between 1989 and 2001, he reports a rise of 3.36 points per decade based on the same tests. Moreover, in their recent meta-analysis, Pietschnig and Voracek (2015) confirmed the 3 points per decade average increase in IQ. Therefore, it is imperative to discuss our negative Flynn Effects in the light of the positive Flynn Effects findings in the literature._x000D_
_x000D_
A first possible explanation is that the studies we report are simply outliers in a much larger set of longitudinal studies on IQ. However, given that some of the studies we reported drew upon very large and population-representative samples, this explanation seems rather unlikely._x000D_
_x000D_
A second possibility is that a phenotypic increase in IQ may have largely overshadowed a possible genotypic decline in IQ and that the latter is only more recently starting to show up in several representative datasets. If we are correct that the positive Flynn Effect is primarily an environmental effect then we should not be especially surprised that it operates differently in different parts of the world. For example, if the positive Flynn Effect would be partly the result of an increase in the ‚Äòscientific worldview‚Äô of the population, then the Flynn Effect may vary in line with the level that a country has reached in adopting such a view. Specifically, factors that may influence the extent to which the population adopts this ‚Äòscientific-spectacles‚Äô view, such as education, wealth, and, possibly, religion, differ between countries._x000D_
_x000D_
Regarding the trade-offs between forces that drive Flynn Effects and forces that drive negative Flynn Effects, it may not be a coincidence that the countries in which we found negative Flynn Effects are some of the wealthiest countries with the best distribution of wealth indices. It is possible that because of these optimizing factors, those countries are among the first to reach the boundaries of the environmental effects on IQ. Consequently, they may also be among the first to indicate a decline in IQ scores. Future research may want to elaborate on these possibilities and focus more strongly on disentangling the various explanations for Flynn versus negative Flynn Effects._x000D_
_x000D_
5. Limitations_x000D_
There are a number of limitations to this analysis. Ideally, in order to establish and understand the causes of the negative Flynn Effect, we need large samples, annual cohorts over a longer period of time, and, where possible, the ability to rule out potential confounding factors such as sex and immigration. We only have this for Finland and, to a lesser extent, Denmark and Norway. Here, we have, from the military conscript data, samples which are almost the entire male population of a certain age, year-on-year. The impact of immigration is likely to be very small, as we have seen, and this is especially so in the case of Finland. Ideally, we would need more samples of this quality and also female samples of this quality as it is possible that the negative Flynn Effect is working at a different rate among females._x000D_
_x000D_
A second limitation can be found in our ability to test hypotheses as to the possible causes of the negative Flynn Effect. As discussed, some of these data have had to be drawn upon because they are the best that we have. Also, because a negative Flynn Effect has only been found in a small number of countries, we are left with a limitation of power, leaving it difficult to have confidence in any correlational finding in this study. In some cases, such as the immigration correlation, it raises the question of whether the correlation reflects immigration causing a country to have a negative Flynn Effect or whether countries that are more developed, and so have a negative Flynn Effect, are more likely to have high levels of immigration._x000D_
_x000D_
6. Concluding statements_x000D_
Although, the Flynn Effect is a well-known phenomenon that has been replicated in many samples and in various countries, several theories predict a negative Flynn Effect (e.g., Lynn, 2011, Woodley et al., 2013). In the current study, we identified the high quality samples reported in the literature that have reported such a negative Flynn Effect. Even though identifying these studies may be a crucial step in this area, future research should further scrutinize the evidence in light of other studies that continue to report an increase in IQ scores. For example, it is unclear why some Western countries, such as the USA, continue to display a positive Flynn Effect._x000D_
_x000D_
With regard to some of the theories we discussed, it seems to us that the simplest explanation for the negative Flynn Effect has already been presented by scholars such as Woodley et al. (2013). The Industrial Revolution had two key and related effects on IQ. Firstly, it set off massive gains on IQ scores by establishing an environment which compelled us to think in more scientific way, compelled us to become more educated, and saturated us with knowledge, information, and novel problems. This process would have pushed certain latent intelligence abilities to their limit and, if this occurred at a sufficient pace, then the imperfect nature of the IQ test means that it would overwhelm whatever else was happening and show up as an IQ rise. However, the Industrial Revolution concomitantly set off a quite different process. It led to the development of reliable contraception and low child mortality, meaning people only needed to have very few children and the more intelligent would be more able to achieve this. Accordingly, the previous positive correlation between intelligence and fertility became negative (Lynn, 2011). Moreover, this positive correlation was a so-called Jensen Effect: it was occurring on general intelligence and on the more heritable dimensions of intelligence. The Flynn Effect would disguise this on IQ tests but once the ceiling of the Flynn Effect was reached, we would see it slowing down and then going into reverse as a negative Flynn Effect. There would, perhaps, be two dimensions to this. One would be purely genetic and the other would be environmental: as the society becomes less intelligent the degree to which it innovates an increasingly cognitively stimulating environment would, set off the by the Industrial Revolution, slow down, meaning it would outpace the decline g to a lesser and lesser extent until it stopped outpacing it altogether, manifesting itself as a negative Flynn Effect._x000D_","The Flynn Effect (rising performance on intelligence tests in the general population over time) is now an established phenomenon in many developed and less developed countries. Recently, evidence has begun to amass that the Flynn Effect has gone into reverse; the so-called ‚ÄòNegative Flynn Effect.‚Äô In this study, we present a systematic literature review, conducted in order to discover in precisely how many countries this reverse phenomenon has been uncovered. Using strict criteria regarding quality of the sample and the study, we found nine studies reporting negative Flynn Effects in seven countries. We also discuss several possible explanations for the negative Flynn Effect as an attempt to understand its most probable causes.","7",0,"7","Apolitical",4,0

Nature human behaviour, 7(4), 515-528.","Across three studies conducted with over 8,000 students, we find that BLI students received maths grades that are an average of 9% lower than their white, Asian and Asian-American peers with the same levels and pattern of academic motivation (95% CI 7 to 11%), even after controlling for students‚Äô prior achievement and other relevant factors. Our findings indicate that BLI students who were highly motivated still received maths grades that were significantly lower than those of their non-BLI peers, underscoring how BLI students confront inequitable academic outcomes no matter how invested they are in their education. Importantly, motivation was still beneficial for the achievement of BLI students. Higher levels of motivation were indeed related to BLI students receiving higher maths grades, as would be predicted by relevant motivational theories (Supplementary Tables 9, 18 and 27). However, motivation appeared to pay greater dividends to the achievement of non-BLI students than BLI students. This pattern highlights the ‚Äònecessary but not sufficient‚Äô nature of motivation and indicates that efforts aimed at ensuring that all students are similarly motivated to succeed should be coupled with broader reforms that target the social forces surrounding BLI students to ensure that they receive the full benefits of their motivation. As discussed previously, however, issues of limited statistical power, particularly within studies 1 and 2, should be considered when interpreting these results and their implications. While this problem is common across studies employing person-centred analyses that inherently examine subgroups within larger populations, and our findings are bolstered by the fact that we conducted a pre-registered replication and found evidence for inequitable patterns of motivational payoff across three diverse samples, our findings must be interpreted cautiously. Additional studies with larger samples of students, especially students characterized by lower levels of motivation, are needed to bolster the current findings._x000D_
_x000D_
Beyond examining whether there were differences in motivational payoff between BLI and non-BLI students, we also examined what factor may give rise to these differences in an effort to determine how researchers and practitioners may promote equitable motivational payoff. The results from the multi-level SEM in study 3 suggest that teachers may be one key social force that determines inequitable motivational payoff. Specifically, teachers‚Äô diminished expectations for the academic futures of their BLI students partially explained patterns of inequitable motivational payoff within three of the four motivational profiles in study 3. In accordance with prior research66, we found that teachers had systematically lower beliefs regarding how far their BLI students could progress in education compared with their white, Asian and Asian-American students. These beliefs were subsequently linked to BLI students receiving significantly lower maths grades than similarly motivated non-BLI students. Of equal importance to understanding the origins of race- and ethnicity-based differences in students‚Äô academic outcomes, inequitable motivational payoff was not explained by differences in BLI and non-BLI students‚Äô effort, feelings of social belonging, academic ability, future educational goals, parental beliefs about education or other potential mediating factors. While issues of statistical power should again be considered when interpreting the implications of the results, the current findings begin to challenge traditional deficit-based narratives that fault BLI students and their parents for racial educational inequities67._x000D_
_x000D_
Altogether, the current studies build on the findings established by prior work to shift attention away from reducing race- and ethnicity-based differences in academic achievement through solely targeting the motivation of individual students, and towards a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between race/ethnicity, motivation, achievement and the social forces that stand in the way of educational equity. Traditionally, reform efforts aimed at ameliorating educational inequities have placed the burden for change on the shoulders of students from marginalized groups themselves, emphasizing solutions that help these students contend with their oppressive academic contexts rather than addressing the contexts themselves27. While such efforts have seen recent success11,68, the current studies indicate that their benefits for students from marginalized racial and ethnic backgrounds may be limited without also addressing the barriers that restrict the extent to which motivation pays off towards their academic achievement._x000D_
_x000D_
The current work specifically builds on prior research suggesting that motivation may not translate into achievement equitably to contribute precise empirical evidence in favour of recent calls for future reform efforts to better support teachers with the resources, pedagogies and knowledge that they need to support BLI students. For example, programmes may look to educate teachers on how the implicit racial biases that are prevalent throughout society can influence their expectations for BLI students, while also equipping teachers with practical recommendations for how they may counter these biases69. Schools may also look to ensure that teachers have more time and opportunities to engage with their BLI students and come to recognize their motivation and academic goals70. More broadly, our findings contribute to the growing call for individual researchers, schools, districts and policies to critically consider the nature of racial educational inequity and its potential solutions71._x000D_
_x000D_
To assist in these efforts, future work clarifying the relationships identified in the current studies is necessary. First, although beyond the scope of the current work, additional causal research is necessary to further establish the relationships between motivation, race/ethnicity, achievement and teachers‚Äô expectations. Given that teachers reported their expectations for their students‚Äô academic futures part of the way through a school year and potentially after students completed their maths test in study 3, we cannot make any causal claims regarding the relationships identified in the current work. While we took steps to ensure greater confidence in our findings (for example, controlling for prior achievement, evaluating potential mediators using SEM and conducting a pre-registered replication), reform efforts that target teachers‚Äô expectations and related behaviours are necessary to substantiate the causal nature of our results and outline future avenues for promoting educational equity._x000D_
_x000D_
Researchers may look to replicate and extend the results from our SEM in other ways. For instance, it is possible that teachers‚Äô expectations for students‚Äô academic futures have a greater influence on motivational payoff among K‚Äì12 students‚Äîwho are constantly exposed to teachers and their beliefs about students‚Äîthan among college and university students. It is also possible that developmental differences between high school and university students may influence the mechanisms underlying motivational payoff. With that said, recent research conducted with samples of students in higher education similarly find that educators‚Äô beliefs about students from marginalized backgrounds play a powerful role in shaping student outcomes and broader educational inequities49,72._x000D_
_x000D_
Future research may also extend the implications of the current studies through examining the processes through which teachers‚Äô biased expectations influence motivational payoff among BLI students. As mentioned previously, prior research has shown that teachers‚Äô beliefs and expectations shape their classroom behaviours in ways that can hinder or promote student learning73,74. Thus, it is possible that teachers‚Äô diminished expectations for their BLI students‚Äô academic futures encourage them to engage in behaviours that lead to inequitable motivational payoff. For instance, if teachers do not expect their BLI students to progress in education, they may become less invested in providing these students with the kinds of constructive feedback and support that can help them deepen their learning and improve their academic abilities. Given that researchers often conceptualize the relationship between motivation and achievement as a dynamic, cyclical and reinforcing process75, it is also possible that teachers‚Äô expectations influence this feedback loop. In this way, even if a BLI student enters a class with high levels of motivation, teachers‚Äô biased expectations may lead them to assign the student lower initial grades, thereby decreasing the student‚Äôs motivation and subsequent academic performance. Investigating these possibilities and related others will provide valuable insights into how we can design programmes and policies that effectively target the teacher behaviours that limit motivational payoff for BLI students._x000D_
_x000D_
Structural factors beyond teachers should also be examined to determine their role in undermining equitable motivational payoff. The potential existence of these factors is highlighted by the fact that the motivational payoff gaps were larger in study 3 than studies 1 and 2. If inequitable motivational payoff was wholly a result of teachers‚Äô biased expectations, which we do not argue, then we would have expected the gaps to be larger in studies 1 and 2 than study 3 given that the outcome variable in these former studies was students‚Äô maths grade point averages (GPAs), which were determined in part by their professors, as opposed to a standardized test that was not administered or graded by students‚Äô teachers, as in study 3 (Methods). Thus, although the current studies focused on teachers as a powerful social force that guide student outcomes, it is likely that there are additional structural factors (for example, school cultures, curricula and educational policies) that are key to developing a complete understanding of the relationships between race/ethnicity, motivation and academic achievement. Future studies, particularly larger-scale studies, should invest additional resources into measuring and understanding these forces. Research may also investigate whether student experiences that stem from unequitable structural factors, such as the stigma and identity-based threats that students from marginalized racial/ethnic backgrounds often face in education76, contribute to inequitable motivational payoff. While much of the identity threat literature has focused on how these threats undermine students‚Äô motivation directly75,77, thus encouraging solutions aimed at bolstering student motivation78, researchers may have opportunities to explore how the social forces that give rise to identity threat may also contribute to inequitable motivational payoff._x000D_
_x000D_
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the current findings help direct attention towards how researchers may best support the movement towards educational equity. In the face of persistent racial injustices across schools in the United States and around the world, behavioural scientists have become increasingly involved in efforts aimed at better supporting the academic success of BLI students. While considerable strides are being made in designing programmes that effectively target individual students and their motivation to support achievement, our work emphasizes the need for critical consideration regarding how research understands the causes of, and solutions for, racial educational inequity. Namely, through demonstrating that BLI students still receive significantly lower grades than their white, Asian and Asian-American peers even when they have the same levels of motivation across three diverse and large-scale datasets, we underscore the notion outlined in previous work that educational inequity will persist as long as we locate the onus for change primarily within students themselves. Rather, through an initial demonstration of the role that teachers‚Äô diminished expectations for BLI students play in undermining equitable motivational payoff, we suggest that further resources must be dedicated to ensuring that the social forces surrounding students (for example, teachers, schools and educational policies) support equitable achievement46,48._x000D_
_x000D_
While we are not advocating for an abandonment of reform efforts that focus on ensuring that individual students have the tools that they need to succeed‚Äîespecially given the brevity and efficacy of these efforts79‚Äîwe are arguing for a reconceptualization of how researchers can most effectively support students‚Äô equitable success80. Our research indicates that behavioural scientists have an important opportunity to advance educational equity through reform efforts that alleviate the barriers preventing students from marginalized backgrounds from capitalizing on the strengths, motivation and resources that they already bring to their educations.","As racial inequities continue to pervade school systems around the world, further research is necessary to understand the factors undergirding this pressing issue. Here across three studies conducted in the United States (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ8,293), we provide evidence that race-based differences in student achievement do not stem from a lack of motivation among Black, Latinx and Indigenous (BLI) students, but a lack of equitable motivational payoff. Even when BLI and non-BLI students have the same levels of motivation, BLI students still receive maths grades that are an average of 9% lower than those of their non-BLI peers (95% confidence interval 7 to 11%). This pattern was not explained by differences in students‚Äô aptitude, effort or prior achievement but was instead linked to teachers‚Äô diminished expectations for their BLI students‚Äô academic futures. We conclude by discussing statistical power limitations and the implications of the current findings for how researchers consider the sources of, and solutions for, educational inequity.","2",0,"2","Political",2,1
90,14,"The Forecasting Collaborative. Insights into the accuracy of social scientists‚Äô forecasts of societal change. Nat Hum Behav 7, 484‚Äì501 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-022-01517-1","How accurate are social scientists‚Äô forecasts of societal change22? The results from two forecasting tournaments conducted during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic show that for most domains, social scientists‚Äô predictions were no better than those from a sample of the (non-specialist) general public. Furthermore, apart from a few domains concerning racial and gender‚Äìcareer bias, scientists‚Äô original forecasts were typically not much better than naive statistical benchmarks derived from historical averages, linear regressions or random walks. Even when we confined the analysis to the top five forecasts by social scientists per domain, a simple linear regression produced less error roughly half of the time (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 9)._x000D_
_x000D_
Forecasting accuracy systematically varied across societal domains. In both tournaments, positive sentiment and gender‚Äìcareer stereotypes were easier to forecast than other phenomena, whereas negative sentiment and bias towards African Americans were the most difficult to forecast. Domain differences in forecasting accuracy corresponded to historical volatility in the time series. Differences in the complexity of positive and negative affect are well documented23,24. Moreover, racial attitudes showed more change than attitudes regarding gender during this period (perhaps due to movements such as Black Lives Matter)._x000D_
_x000D_
Which strategies and team characteristics were associated with more effective forecasts? One defining feature of more effective forecasters was that they relied on prior data rather than theory alone. This observation fits with prior studies on the performance of algorithmic versus intuitive human judgements21. Social scientists who relied on prior data also performed better than lay crowds and were overrepresented among the winning teams (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 8)._x000D_
_x000D_
Forecasting experience and subject matter expertise on a forecasted topic also incrementally contributed to better performance in the tournaments (R2 (partial)‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.010). This is in line with some prior research on the value of subject matter expertise for geopolitical forecasts6 and for the prediction of success of behavioural science interventions25. Notably, we found that publication track record on a topic, rather than subjective confidence in domain expertise or confidence in the forecast, contributed to greater accuracy. It is possible that subjective confidence in domain expertise conflates expertise and overconfidence26,27,28 (versus intellectual humility). There is some evidence that overconfident forecasters are less accurate29,30. These findings, along with the lack of a domain-general effect of social science expertise on performance compared with the general public, invite consideration of whether what usually counts as expertise in the social sciences translates into a greater ability to predict future real-world trends._x000D_
_x000D_
The nature of our forecasting tournaments allowed social scientists to self-select any of the 12 forecasting domains, inspect three years of historical trends for each domain and update their predictions on the basis of feedback on their initial performance in the first tournament. These features emulated typical forecasting platforms (for example, metaculus.com). We argue that this approach enhances our ability to draw externally valid and generalizable inferences from a forecasting tournament. However, this approach also resulted in a complex, unbalanced design. Scholars interested in isolating psychological mechanisms that foster superior forecasts may benefit from a simpler design whereby all forecasting teams make forecasts for all requested domains._x000D_
_x000D_
Another issue in designing forecasting tournaments involves the determination of domains that one may want participants to forecast. In designing the present tournaments, we provided the participants with at least three years of monthly historical data for each forecasting domain. An advantage of making the same historical data available for all forecasters is that it establishes a ‚Äúcommon task framework‚Äù9,16,17, ensuring that the main sources of information about the forecasting domains remain identical across all participants. However, this approach restricts the types of social issues that participants can forecast. A simpler design without the inclusion of historical data would have had the advantage of greater flexibility in selecting forecasting domains._x000D_
_x000D_
Why were forecasts of societal change largely inaccurate, even though the participants had data-based resources and ample time to deliberate? One possibility concerns self-selection. Perhaps the participants in the Forecasting Collaborative were unusually bad at forecasting compared with social scientists as a whole. This possibility seems unlikely. We made efforts to recruit highly successful social scientists at different career stages and from different subdisciplines (Supplementary Information). Indeed, many of our forecasters are well-established scholars. We thus do not expect members of the Forecasting Collaborative to be worse at forecasting than other members of the social science community. Nevertheless, only a random sample of social scientists (albeit impractical) would have fully addressed the self-selection concern._x000D_
_x000D_
Second, it is possible that social scientists were not adequately incentivized to perform well in our tournaments. We provided reputational incentives by announcing the winners and rankings of participating teams, but like other big-team science projects8,31, we did not provide performance-based monetary incentives32, because they may not be key motivating factors for intrinsically motivated social scientists33. Indeed, the drop-out rate between Tournaments 1 and 2 was marginal, suggesting that the participating teams were motivated to continue being part of the initiative. This reasoning aside, it is possible that stronger incentives for accurate forecasting (whether reputation-based or monetary) could have stimulated some scientists to perform better in our forecasting tournament, opening doors for future directions to address this question directly._x000D_
_x000D_
Third, social scientists often deal with phenomena with small effect sizes that are overestimated in the literature8,31,34. Additionally, social scientists frequently study social phenomena in conditions that maximize experimental control but may have little external validity, and it is argued that this not only limits the generalizability of findings but in fact reduces their internal validity. In the world beyond the laboratory, where more factors are at play, such effects may be smaller than social scientists might think on the basis of their lab studies, and in fact, such effects may be spurious given the lack of external validity35,36. Social scientists may thus overestimate and misestimate the impacts of the effects they study in the lab on real-world phenomena37,38._x000D_
_x000D_
Fourth, social scientists tend to theorize about individuals and groups and conduct research at those scales. However, findings from such work may not scale up when predicting phenomena on the scale of entire societies39. Like other dynamical systems in economics, physics or biology, societal-level processes may also be genuinely stochastic rather than deterministic. If so, stochastic models will be hard to outperform._x000D_
_x000D_
Fifth, training in predictive modelling is not a requirement in many social sciences programmes10. Social scientists often prioritize explanations over formal predictions5. For instance, statistical training in the social sciences typically emphasizes unbiased estimation of model parameters in the sample over predictive out-of-sample accuracy40. Moreover, typical graduate curricula in many areas of social science, such as social or clinical psychology, do not require computational training in predictive modelling. The formal empirical study of societal change is relatively uncommon in these disciplines. Most social scientists approach individual- or group-level phenomena in an atemporal fashion39. Scientists may favour post hoc explanations of specific one-time events rather than the future trajectory of social phenomena. Although time is a key theoretical variable for foundational theories in many subfields of the social sciences, such as field theory41, it has remained an elusive concept._x000D_
_x000D_
Finally, perhaps it is unreasonable to expect theories and models developed during a relatively stable post‚ÄìWorld War II period to accurately predict societal trends during a once-in-a-century health crisis. Precisely for this reason, we targeted predictions in domains possessing pandemic-relevant theoretical models (for instance, models about the impact of pathogen spread or social isolation). In this way, we sought to provide a stress test of ostensibly relevant theoretical models in a context (a pandemic-induced crisis) where change was most likely to be both meaningful and measurable. Nevertheless, the present work suggests that social scientists may not be particularly accurate at forecasting societal trends in this context, though it remains possible that they would perform better during more ‚Äònormal‚Äô times. The considerations above notwithstanding, future work should seek to address this question._x000D_
_x000D_
How can social scientists become better forecasters? Perhaps the first steps might involve probing the limits of social science theories by evaluating whether a given theory is suitable for making societal predictions in the first place or whether it is too narrow or too vague5,42. Relatedly, social scientists need to test their theories using representatively designed experiments. Moreover, social scientists may benefit from testing whether a societal trend is deterministic and hence can benefit from theory-driven components, or whether it unfolds in a purely stochastic fashion. For instance, one can start by decomposing a time series into the trend, autoregressive and seasonal components, examining each of them and their meaning for one‚Äôs theory and model. One can further perform a unit root test to examine whether the time series is non-stationary. Training in recognizing and modelling the properties of time series and dynamical systems may need to become more firmly integrated into graduate curricula in the field. A classic insight in the time series literature is that the mean of the historical time series may be among the best multi-step-ahead predictors for a stationary time series43. Using such insights to build predictions from the ground up can afford greater accuracy. In turn, such training can open the door to more robust models of social phenomena and human behaviour, with a promise of greater generalizability in the real world._x000D_
_x000D_
Given the broad societal impact of phenomena such as prejudice, political polarization and well-being, the ability to accurately predict trends in these variables is crucially important for policymakers and the experts guiding them. But despite common beliefs that social science experts are better equipped to accurately predict these trends than non-experts1, the current findings suggest that social and behavioural scientists have a lot of room for growth44. The good news is that forecasting skills can be improved. Consider the growing accuracy of forecasting models in meteorology in the second part of the twentieth century45. Greater consideration of representative experimental designs, temporal dynamics, better training in forecasting methods and more practice with formal forecasting all may improve social scientists‚Äô ability to accurately forecast societal trends going forward.","How well can social scientists predict societal change, and what processes underlie their predictions? To answer these questions, we ran two forecasting tournaments testing the accuracy of predictions of societal change in domains commonly studied in the social sciences: ideological preferences, political polarization, life satisfaction, sentiment on social media, and gender‚Äìcareer and racial bias. After we provided them with historical trend data on the relevant domain, social scientists submitted pre-registered monthly forecasts for a year (Tournament 1; N‚Äâ=‚Äâ86 teams and 359 forecasts), with an opportunity to update forecasts on the basis of new data six months later (Tournament 2; N‚Äâ=‚Äâ120 teams and 546 forecasts). Benchmarking forecasting accuracy revealed that social scientists‚Äô forecasts were on average no more accurate than those of simple statistical models (historical means, random walks or linear regressions) or the aggregate forecasts of a sample from the general public (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ802). However, scientists were more accurate if they had scientific expertise in a prediction domain, were interdisciplinary, used simpler models and based predictions on prior data.","3",0,"3","Political",4,0
91,14,"Roberts, S. O. (2024). Dealing With Diversity in Psychology: Science and Ideology. Perspectives on Psychological Science, 19(3), 590-601. https://doi.org/10.1177/17456916241240743","Calls for increased racial diversity in psychological science have not been without criticism. The most recent are made by Hommel (this issue), Jussim (this issue), Stanovich (this issue), and Stroebe (this issue), who collectively argue that scientific discourse around diversity has been ideological and not scientific. Hommel (this issue) summarizes the claims:_x000D_
The increasing use of political activist arguments and reasoning in scientific communication about diversity is criticized. Based on an article of Roberts, Bareket-Shavit, Dollins, Goldie, and Mortenson (2020) . . . three hallmarks of the intrusion of activist thinking into science are described: (1) blindness to the multidimensional nature of diversity, (2) a failure to distinguish mechanisms from effect moderators, and (3) blindness to agency as an explanation for psychological observations._x000D_
I next consider the scientific merit of these claims._x000D_
_x000D_
‚ÄúBlindness to the multidimensional nature of diversity‚Äù_x000D_
The claim is that Roberts et al. (2020) neglected the many other social identities that have implications for human behavior and that they were unjustified in focusing exclusively on race (see Hommel, this issue; Jussim, this issue; Stanovich, this issue). Hommel (this issue) writes:_x000D_
The call for diversity was restricted to just one of more than 100 possible personal features of already demonstrated psychological relevance. If we are to report the race of editors, reviewers, authors, and participants, as Roberts et al. demand, it seems logical to also demand reporting their cultural, religious, and economic background; their political orientation, intelligence, and motivational structure; their needs, learning history, experience, and personality and traits; their body size, handedness, disabilities, and cognitive style; in addition to tens if not hundreds of other personal features that might have affected the measures of interest in past studies._x000D_
This claim is false. Roberts et al. (2020) made clear that psychological science needs diversity across a wide array of domains and took care to not privilege race as an independent or primary vector of analysis:_x000D_
_x000D_
Although race was the focus in this research, intersectionality is also vital to a healthy and representative science (e.g., persons representing a wide range of gender, political, religious, and sexual identities). For example, it could be made clear in the positionality statement that the research question concerns gender yet the research team consists only of individuals who identify as male, or that the research participants are members of the LGBTQ community yet the research team consists only of individuals who identify as heterosexual and cisgender. If the researchers are making claims about any social identity, their relationship with that identity could be stated. (p. 1305)_x000D_
This claim also misrepresents Roberts et al. (2020). As made clear in the quote above, the argument is that if a research topic is about a particular identity (e.g., race, sexual orientation, political attitudes), researchers could make their relationship to that identity clear. If, for example, the research topic involves people of color, but all of the researchers are White, readers might benefit from this information being made transparent, especially given the scientific benefits of conducting research with people rather than on them (see Cornwall & Jewkes, 1995)._x000D_
_x000D_
Another issue with this claim is that it suggests that if one does not study everything one cannot study anything, which is unsound and unproductive. Scientists must distinguish processes that generalize across domains (e.g., no matter their identity, researchers from minority identities might feel a lower sense of belonging in academia; Cheryan et al., 2009) from those that are more domain-specific (e.g., in the domain of political identity, in a left-leaning discipline that favors left-leaning research, conservative professors might be discouraged from researching politicized topics; Honeycutt & Jussim, 2020). Stated another way, processes that generalize across domains are distinct from processes that are local to specific domains._x000D_
_x000D_
‚ÄúFailure to distinguish mechanisms from effect moderators‚Äù_x000D_
The claim is that Roberts et al. (2020) failed to acknowledge that the mechanisms underlying psychological processes generalize to all of humanity and that research designed to test such processes does not require diverse or representative samples (see Hommel, this issue; Stanovich, this issue; Stroebe, this issue)._x000D_
_x000D_
The first issue with this claim is that what it assumes to be true is itself an empirical question. That is, to make scientific claims about the generalizability of psychological processes, one must scientifically demonstrate that they do in fact generalize, and scientists have for decades argued that the psychological processes assumed to be basic, universal, or generalizable (e.g., moral reasoning, memory recall, spatial cognition, visual perception) are in fact subject to social and cultural variation (e.g., Arnett, 2008; Henrich et al., 2010; Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Wang, 2016). Indeed, there is a long tradition of research revealing how our perceptions of the world are filtered through specific social experiences and motivations (Heider, 1944; Ross, 1977). Context matters, and race is a salient context. If our science focused exclusively on the few mechanisms that generalize to all of humanity rather than the infinite universe of mechanisms that vary within and between contexts, we would be left with a paltry science._x000D_
_x000D_
The second issue with this claim is that it neglects the scientific evidence suggesting that because of racial biases, scientists of all racial backgrounds might conceptualize research with White samples as more generalizable and valuable than research with samples of color (Cheon et al., 2020; DeJesus et al., 2019; Roberts & Mortenson, 2023). Consequently, researchers might be uninterested in (or dissuaded from) conducting research with samples of color, examining or specifying the role of White identity in psychological processes, or challenging the norms that maintain the presumed racelessness of White people, all of which would reinforce the idea that studying White people is sufficient for studying humans (see Roberts & Mortenson, 2023)._x000D_
_x000D_
The third issue with this claim is that it assumes that diverse participants are useful simply for providing insight into the generalizability of psychological processes, but this misses the ‚Äúother‚Äù perspective entirely. Namely, if mainstream psychological science consists mostly of White editors, reviewers, authors, and participants, it might not even think to explore processes that are outside of the perspectives, experiences, or interests of White scientists (e.g., how to diversify a White-centric discipline, or how to circumvent dehumanization and racial obstacles), which would leave those processes in place and invisible to the benefit of White people and the detriment of people of color. Indeed, a homogeneous group of scientists might be unable to understand processes outside of their purview, especially if the reason for their homogeneity is a motivation, either unconscious or not, to keep those processes out of their purview. Stated another way, if a group of all-White scientists does not even acknowledge that they are all White, they might become opposed to any efforts toward racial diversity because such efforts would break their collective illusion and force them to acknowledge that they are in fact all White._x000D_
_x000D_
‚ÄúBlindness to agency‚Äù_x000D_
The claim is that intentions and individual preferences, rather than circumstances and systemic obstacles, might play a role in the underrepresentation of people of color in positions of influence in science and that Roberts et al. (2020) neglected the former possibility and focused exclusively on the latter. This supposed ‚Äúblindness‚Äù is interpreted as further evidence of the authors‚Äô ideological biases and political activism (see Hommel, this issue; Jussim, this issue; Stanovich, this issue)._x000D_
_x000D_
The primary issue with this claim is that it reflects a lack of understanding of the basic fundamentals surrounding race and racism. That is, if one does not recognize the systemic barriers that might cause the underrepresentation of people of color in positions of influence, one might naively assume that people of color are the sole cause of their underrepresentation rather than the systemic barriers that they are subject to (see Cimpian & Salomon, 2014; Nelson et al., 2012). And research makes clear that those barriers are abundant (Jones, 2023; Salter et al., 2018). To name a few, for scientists of color to ascend to positions of influence in science, they must overcome the stereotypes that dissociate them from leadership, pay the ‚Äúminority tax‚Äù that disproportionately burdens them and stifles their research progress, and navigate a White-centric discipline that leaves them with few mentors, signals that they have no future within the discipline, and displays open hostility toward any efforts to make science more diverse (Auelua-Toomey & Roberts, 2022; Avery et al., 2013; Campbell & Rodr√≠guez, 2019; Marin-Spiotta et al, 2020; Purdie-Vaughns et al., 2008; Storage et al., 2016). Unless one presents evidence for the claim that people of color are uninterested in positions of influence in science, the null hypothesis should hold: All racial groups are equally interested in positions of influence, regardless of the field, assuming that the field is equally hospitable to all racial groups._x000D_
_x000D_
Other claims worth addressing_x000D_
It is beyond the scope of this single article to address every concern raised in this discussion forum, in part because they range from unsound and unfalsifiable arguments to arguments that suggest an inadequate grasp of the scientific literature on race and racism. However, I focus below on the scientific merit of three additional claims that I ought not leave unaddressed in the permanent scientific record._x000D_
_x000D_
Base rates_x000D_
The claim is that Roberts et al. (2020) failed to consider base rates, such that the representation of White editors and authors might simply reflect the representation of White people in the contexts in which those data were sampled (see Hommel, this issue; Jussim, this issue). I agree, but this is irrelevant to the bigger argument._x000D_
_x000D_
First, how might accounting for base rates change the conclusions that an editor‚Äôs racial identity predicted the content of the articles, or that White authors were more common in the general journals and less common in the specialty journals? Second, this claim neglects the reality that Roberts et al. (2020) analyzed journals that generalized themselves to all of humanity (e.g., the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology did not advertise itself as the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in the United States of America). Even if the editors, authors, and participants involved with the articles published in such a journal numerically represented the demographic groups from the specific geographical, socioeconomic, and institutional contexts in which those journals were located, one would not be justified in presenting the findings published in those journals as generalizable to all of humanity (see Cheon et al., 2020; Roberts & Mortenson, 2023). Relatedly, most editors at top psychology journals are not only White but also male and from the United States (Lin & Li, 2023a, 2023b). How might base rates account for this? Third, this claim neglects the possibility that the representation of White editors and authors is self-populating (i.e., to the extent to which White psychologists interact primarily with other White psychologists, they might selectively invite other White psychologists to such positions; Ibarra, 1995; Wimmer & Lewis, 2010)._x000D_
_x000D_
Selective data_x000D_
The claim is that Roberts et al. (2020) made unclear or arbitrary methodological decisions, such that they focused exclusively on North American and European journals, and that it is therefore trivial that the editors, authors, and participants are primarily from those regions (see Hommel, this issue; Jussim, this issue; Stanovich, this issue)._x000D_
_x000D_
Roberts et al. (2020) focused on these journals because they were the highest impact journals within each discipline. The goal was to survey the ‚Äútop‚Äù psychology journals, not all journals. Roberts et al.

Mules and horses_x000D_
Jussim (this issue) writes:_x000D_
To be sure, if some psychologists in some fields wish to devote extra effort and attention to samples of color, I have no objection. Special attention to samples of color deserves a place in psychological science. Let‚Äôs not pretend, however, that such samples are somehow inherently scientifically more rigorous than ones that more closely approximate the demographics of the underlying population. Scientists who wish to plow their fields with mules should be permitted to do so; they should not, however, pretend that those mules are horses or suggest that, unless others give up their horses, they are doing something scientifically suboptimal._x000D_
I will grant Jussim (this issue) the benefit of the doubt and assume that he chose this ‚Äúmules vs. horses‚Äù metaphor to advance the argument that studying one form of diversity (e.g., racial diversity) is not as complete as studying all forms of diversity. However, this metaphor is scientifically not necessary to advance that argument, and it is startling because it explicitly parallels people of color with mules (i.e., the sterile offspring of a horse and a donkey), which is a well-documented racist trope used to dehumanize people of color. As one historian put it, ‚Äúmules and African Americans shared close ties in the minds of white southerners,‚Äù who conceptualized and portrayed them both as unintelligent, inefficient, and inferior ‚Äúbeasts of burden‚Äù that belonged in the field and away from their masters (Ellenberg, 1998, p. 387). Again, I grant Jussim (this issue) the benefit of the doubt, but given the present question of the intersection between ideology and science, it is important to make crystal clear that the scientific consensus is that racial categories are social categories, not animal categories, and that conceptualizing racial categories as if they were animal categories is an essentialist worldview that predicts (and is predicted by) stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination and a decreased interest in contact with individuals from diverse racial backgrounds (Haslam et al., 2000; Mandalaywala et al., 2018; Williams & Eberhardt, 2008). Depicting people of color as mules is a historically outdated, inaccurate, and dangerous concept that reflects and reinforces the belief that White people are better, purer, and more productive (Davis, 1991; Ellenberg, 1998; Roberts et al., 2022). People of color are not mules, and they are no longer required to plow fields. They should not require special attention or extra effort from some psychologists in some fields. People of color deserve the same amount of attention and effort as White people, and they deserve to be represented across the entirety of our science as full human beings._x000D_

Conclusion_x000D_
In a scientific debate about diversity, scientific arguments should not be presented without evidence (e.g., claiming that political activist arguments are increasing in science), as doing so shifts the burden of proof to the reader and pretends that the claims are established facts (burden of proof fallacy). Scientific arguments should also not be framed within dichotomous ‚Äúeither/or‚Äù scenarios (e.g., claiming that dealing with diversity is either a matter of science or ideology), as doing so is unsound (false dichotomy fallacy). And they should certainly not invoke claims about the characteristics of other scientists, the credibility or track record of those scientists, or truncated media articles about those scientists and their research, as such arguments focus on the scientist and have no direct bearing on the actual scientific arguments (ad hominem fallacy).1 It should go without saying that critiquing a single scientific article does not license one to draw conclusions about the ideologies of those scientists, nor does it license one to draw conclusions about the entire scientific literature that one has failed to review._x000D_
_x000D_
Of course, no scientific claims should be immune from critical inquiry. In fact, disagreement presents a powerful opportunity for learning. However, how we express disagreement is critical. Balanced discussion, sound arguments, and scientific evidence advance understanding. Hyperbole, talking points, hostile or dismissive language, personal attacks, and shaming do not. I hope that this commentary serves as an opportunity to advance our collective understanding of the intersections between science and ideology and that it inspires future generations of psychological scientists to work toward a more democratic, self-aware, and productive science. And to that future generation, I close here with words of wisdom from Toni Morrison (1975):_x000D_
The very serious function of racism is distraction. It keeps you from doing your work. It keeps you explaining, over and over again, your reason for being.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 113(2), 310-315.","Taken together, our findings provide strong evidence for the importance of ecology as a cue used by social perceivers in anticipating the affordances of others. Study 1 demonstrated that individuals hold ecology stereotypes, stereotyping individuals from desperate ecologies as possessing faster life history strategies than individuals from hopeful ecologies. In testing alternative explanations, studies 2‚Äì4 find that these ecology stereotypes are applied within race to both blacks and whites, within wealth to both rich and poor individuals, and that ecology stereotypes are not just the result of a positivity bias toward individuals from hopeful ecologies. Returning to our core premise, study 5 demonstrated that‚Äîin the absence of ecology information‚Äîrace stereotypes track basic ecology stereotypes; however, when provided with information about both the race and ecology of others, individuals‚Äô inferences reflect the targets‚Äô ecology rather than the targets‚Äô race. In the social inference process, ecology information trumps race._x000D_
_x000D_
The diminished use of race as a cue in the face of ecology information has important implications for person perception and social inferences. Although we do not claim that all race stereotypes derive from ecology stereotypes, our findings suggest that many prominent race stereotypes of black Americans (e.g., promiscuity, criminality) might not reflect beliefs about race at all. Race is, instead, a heuristic cue used by social perceivers to infer life history strategies‚Äîand resulting behavioral inclinations‚Äîof targets. When more proximate cues to life history strategy (e.g., home ecology) are presented, the application of these race stereotypes to individual blacks and whites disappears._x000D_
_x000D_
That we suggest the content of many prominent race stereotypes reflects not race, per se, but rather the ecologies in which members of different races are presumed to live, should not be interpreted to also suggest that race is an unimportant psychological construct. Race has important implications for individuals‚Äô social identities, shapes societal institutions, and likely drives prejudices not directly linked to stereotypes about life history strategies. However, as previous research on coalitional psychology has noted (25, 26), the lack of exposure to individuals of different races over human evolutionary history suggests that the social mind should not have evolved to encode race as a fundamental category. Rather, race in modern societies often functions as a secondary cue‚Äîto home ecologies, as evidenced by our findings, and to coalitional membership, as evidenced by existing work (25, 26)._x000D_
_x000D_
Here, we argued that ecology shapes behavior, which in turn shapes perceivers‚Äô stereotypes about the likely affordances posed by others. Although this assumes some degree of accuracy in perceiver stereotypes (27, 28), this is far from claiming that stereotypes are perfectly accurate. Cues to threat are imperfectly diagnostic (4). Moreover, from an affordance management perspective, stereotype inaccuracies are likely to be biased in the direction of exaggerating threats (29, 30). For example, because the costs of physical injury are typically greater than the costs of a missed acquaintanceship, we might expect stereotypes about individuals from desperate ecologies to exaggerate their physical aggressiveness (4)._x000D_
_x000D_
We defined desperate ecologies as harsh and unpredictable. However, certain ecologies within the United States may be resource poor but predictable and thereby afford social stability‚Äîas seen, for example, in family-centered immigrant communities. These ecologies may induce a slower life history strategy compared with ecologies that are both harsh and unpredictable‚Äîwhich stereotypes of such groups might then track._x000D_
_x000D_
In the current research, we focused on stereotypes of white and black Americans, given that, in the United States, race is somewhat diagnostic of ecology (21, 22). In societies where race or ethnicity is not confounded with ecology, however, we would not expect race or ethnicity to be used as a heuristic cue to ecology. However, ecology stereotypes should still exist and substantially shape people‚Äôs perceptions of others. Across societies, individuals from desperate ecologies should be stereotyped to possess faster life history strategies than individuals from hopeful ecologies._x000D_
_x000D_
Additionally, because ecologies shape behaviors and social perceivers have an interest in anticipating those behaviors, similar ecology stereotypes should be held by those living both within and outside these ecologies. That is, individuals living in desperate ecologies and individuals living in hopeful ecologies should hold similar stereotypes about targets from desperate and hopeful ecologies. However, these stereotypes may not similarly translate into prejudices, as the evaluation of the affordances ostensibly posed by these targets may differ. For example, whereas a perceiver from either ecology may stereotype a target as sexually unrestricted, this trait may be viewed as an opportunity or threat depending on the perceiver‚Äôs own ecology-driven life history strategy._x000D_
_x000D_
Race stereotypes have far-reaching consequences. Stereotypes about groups can lead to negative prejudices and discrimination directed toward members of those groups, with associated financial, health, and societal implications. We proposed and provided initial evidence for why American race stereotypes take the particular forms they do: race acts as a cue to a person‚Äôs ecology, and home ecology provides important information about the potential threats and opportunities posed by others. If ecology information can reduce the application of race stereotypes, this may shed new light on ways of reducing racial prejudices and discrimination._x000D_","Why do race stereotypes take the forms they do? Life history theory posits that features of the ecology shape individuals‚Äô behavior. Harsh and unpredictable (‚Äúdesperate‚Äù) ecologies induce fast strategy behaviors such as impulsivity, whereas resource-sufficient and predictable (‚Äúhopeful‚Äù) ecologies induce slow strategy behaviors such as future focus. We suggest that individuals possess a lay understanding of ecology‚Äôs influence on behavior, resulting in ecology-driven stereotypes. Importantly, because race is confounded with ecology in the United States, we propose that Americans‚Äô stereotypes about racial groups actually reflect stereotypes about these groups‚Äô presumed home ecologies. Study 1 demonstrates that individuals hold ecology stereotypes, stereotyping people from desperate ecologies as possessing faster life history strategies than people from hopeful ecologies. Studies 2‚Äì4 rule out alternative explanations for those findings. Study 5, which independently manipulates race and ecology information, demonstrates that when provided with information about a person‚Äôs race (but not ecology), individuals‚Äô inferences about blacks track stereotypes of people from desperate ecologies, and individuals‚Äô inferences about whites track stereotypes of people from hopeful ecologies. However, when provided with information about both the race and ecology of others, individuals‚Äô inferences reflect the targets‚Äô ecology rather than their race: black and white targets from desperate ecologies are stereotyped as equally fast life history strategists, whereas black and white targets from hopeful ecologies are stereotyped as equally slow life history strategists. These findings suggest that the content of several predominant race stereotypes may not reflect race, per se, but rather inferences about how one‚Äôs ecology influences behavior.","4",0,"4","Political",3,0

Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review. https://doi.org/10.37016/mr-2020-55","Two years since the call for a systematic ‚Äúscience of fake news‚Äù to study the vulnerabilities of individuals, institutions, and society to manipulation by malicious actors (Lazer et al., 2018), the response of the research community has been robust. However, the answers provided by the growing body of studies on (accidental) misinformation and (intentional) disinformation are not simple. They paint a picture in which a complex system of factors interact to give rise to the patterns of spread, exposure, and impact that we observe in the information ecosystem.

Indeed, our findings reveal a correlation between political partisanship, echo chambers, and vulnerability to misinformation. While this confounds the effects of echo chambers and political partisanship on vulnerability to misinformation, the present analysis shows that partisanship is more strongly associated with misinformation. This finding suggests that one approach for social media platforms to combat the spread of misinformation is by prioritizing more diverse, less polarized content. Methods similar to those used here can be readily applied to the identification of such content.

Prior research has highlighted an association between conservative political leaning and misinformation sharing (Grinberg et al., 2019) and exposure (Chen et al., 2020). The proliferation of conspiratorial narratives about COVID-19 (Kearney et al., 2020; Evanega et al., 2020) and voter fraud (Benkler et al., 2020) in the run-up to the 2020 U.S. election is consistent with this association. As social media platforms have moved to more aggressively moderate disinformation around the election, they have come under heavy accusations of political censorship. While we find that liberal partisans are also vulnerable to misinformation, this is not a symmetric relationship: Consistent with previous studies, we also find that the association between partisanship and misinformation is stronger among conservative users. This implies that attempts by platforms to be politically ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù in their countermeasures are based on a false equivalence and therefore biased‚Äîat least at the current time. Government regulation could play a role in setting guidelines for the non-partisan moderation of political disinformation. 

Further work is necessary to understand the nature of the relationship between partisanship and vulnerability to misinformation. Are the two mutually reinforcing, or does one stem from the other? The answer to this question can inform how social media platforms prioritize interventions such as fact-checking of articles, reining in extremist groups spreading misinformation, and changing their algorithms to provide exposure to more diverse content on news feeds.

The growing literature on misinformation identifies different classes of actors (information producers, consumers, and intermediaries) involved in its spread, with different goals, incentives, capabilities, and biases (Ruths, 2019). Not only are individuals and organizations hard to model, but even if we could explain individual actions, we would not be able to easily predict collective behaviors, such as the impact of a disinformation campaign, due to the large, complex, and dynamic networks of interactions enabled by social media. 

Despite the difficulties in modeling the spread of misinformation, several key findings have emerged. Regarding exposure, when one considers news articles that have been fact-checked, false reports spread more virally than real news (Vosoughi et al., 2018). Despite this, a relatively small portion of voters was exposed to misinformation during the 2016 U.S. presidential election (Grinberg et al., 2019). This conclusion was based on the assumption that all posts by friends are equally likely to be seen. However, since social media platforms rank content based on popularity and personalization (Nikolov et al., 2019), highly-engaging false news would get higher exposure. In fact, algorithmic bias may amplify exposure to low-quality content (Ciampaglia et al., 2018).

Other vulnerabilities to misinformation stem from cognitive biases such as lack of reasoning (Pennycook & Rand, 2019a) and preference for novel content (Vosoughi et al., 2018). Competition for our finite attention also has been shown to play a key role in content virality (Weng et al., 2012). Models suggest that even if social media users prefer to share high-quality content, the system-level correlation between quality and popularity is low when users are unable to process much of the information shared by their friends (Qiu et al., 2017). 

Misinformation spread can also be the result of manipulation. Social bots (Ferrara et al., 2016; Varol et al., 2017) can be designed to target vulnerable communities (Shao et al., 2018b; Yan et al., 2020) and exploit human and algorithmic biases that favor engaging content (Ciampaglia et al., 2018; Avram et al., 2020), leading to an amplification of exposure (Shao et al., 2018a; Lou et al., 2019).

Finally, the polarized and segregated structure of political communication in online social networks (Conover et al., 2011) implies that information spreads efficiently within echo-chambers but not across them (Conover et al., 2012). Users are thus shielded by diverse perspectives, including fact-checking sources (Shao et al., 2018b). Models suggest that homogeneity and polarization are important factors in the spread of misinformation (Del Vicario et al., 2016).","We analyze the relationship between partisanship, echo chambers, and vulnerability to online misinformation by studying news sharing behavior on Twitter. While our results confirm prior findings that online misinformation sharing is strongly correlated with right-leaning partisanship, we also uncover a similar, though weaker, trend among left-leaning users. Because of the correlation between a user‚Äôs partisanship and their position within a partisan echo chamber, these types of influence are confounded. To disentangle their effects, we performed a regression analysis and found that vulnerability to misinformation is most strongly influenced by partisanship for both left- and right-leaning users.","4",0,"4","Political",2,0

Scientific Reports, 13(1). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-29512-0","Our experiments confirm some of the few existing findings on a relationship between ideology and cooperation, while clarifying why such findings have not always been consistent and contributing to the literature with four important points. Firstly, the general relationship between political ideology and cooperation did not reach statistical significance. Overall cooperation trends into the direction shown by Gr√ºnhage and Reuter in a standard public goods game15, but we cannot confidently verify their finding of higher overall cooperation by leftists unless we also examine on which public goods leftists and rightists cooperate. Whereas cooperation on a public good that provides unequal returns did not differ per ideology, left-leaning individuals cooperated far more than right-leaning ones on an equal-returns public good (Hypothesis 1b). Moreover, we obtained some evidence that this effect is limited to situations in which the equal public good meets or exceeds the efficiency of an alternative, unequal public good. When the unequal-returns public good provides greater collective welfare, something core to leftists‚Äô values7,23,47, leftists‚Äô preference for efficiency overrides their general preference for equality (also see 48,49)._x000D_
_x000D_
Earlier work showed that cooperation in economic games may be explained by the trust that people have that their fellow group members will also cooperate (in line with17,50,51; Hypothesis 3). Left-leaning individuals in our sample did trust more than right-leaning ones that others would cooperate on a public good that allows both equal returns and high efficiency. The effect does not seem to be very strong, however, and we did not find mediation of cooperation through trust (also see16,17). Norms may provide additional insight into the relationship of ideology and cooperation, as general population expectations contain more variation than individual beliefs._x000D_
_x000D_
Perhaps not surprisingly, political ideology‚Äîa conglomerate of beliefs about the proper order of society and how to achieve it‚Äîhas been shown to relate to norm abiding behavior and moral norms14,32. To the authors‚Äô knowledge, not much work has investigated the relationship of ideology and social norms in social dilemmas. We find that ideology neither predicts normative nor descriptive expectations of overall cooperation when both public goods are of same efficiency. Notably, ideology neither predicts normative expectations of cooperation on the respective public goods‚Äîboth left- and right-leaning individuals deem it morally appropriate to cooperate more on the public good providing equal returns rather than unequal returns. Left- and right-leaning individuals do, however, carry different descriptive expectations about how others are going to behave in actuality. Left-leaning individuals expect that others will cooperate more on equal public goods than on unequal public goods, whereas right-leaning ones do not hold different expectations for the two public goods. If anything, the latter expect others to contribute relatively more to the unequal public good than to the equal one._x000D_
_x000D_
Connecting our findings across studies suggests that leftists‚Äô behavior seems to be consistent with their trust towards fellow group members, as well as what they find morally appropriate and expect other people to do in general. In other words, when inequality and equality must be traded off at constant efficiency, leftists cooperate more on the equal public good than on the unequal public good, and this is in line with their trust, descriptive expectations, and normative expectations._x000D_
_x000D_
The combined findings suggest further that rightists may not be consistent in their behavior and norms when inequality and equality must be traded off at constant efficiency. Right-leaning individuals in our sample do not differentiate cooperation on the equal public good from the unequal public good, and they do not expect other people to do so. Both right-leaning individuals inside and outside of the multiple-public goods game expect (i.e., trust) others to cooperate relatively more on unequal public goods, speaking to previous findings that rightists see the world as a more dangerous place38,40,41,42 or, as presented in recent findings, a more hierarchical place than leftists do43. However, uninvolved right-leaning individuals do deem it morally appropriate to cooperate more on the equal public good than on the unequal public good, as do left-leaning ones. This pattern indicates the possibility that rightists‚Äô cooperation behavior may be driven by (descriptive) expectations rather than by normative expectations, while leftists‚Äô cooperation may be driven by both descriptive and normative expectations. Right-leaning individuals being inconsistent in their normative expectations and their behavior appears puzzling, given the fact that past research has nearly unanimously found rightists to be more norm abiding than leftists14,52,53. Relatedly, (right wing) authoritarianism has been linked with increased norm adherence54 and, on the flip side, aversion towards norm violations33._x000D_
_x000D_
These findings indicate to us that it is a relevant avenue to identify the (types of) social norms at play amongst leftists and rightists, to unravel when and why they (do not) cooperate in social dilemmas. Future research may further investigate this mechanism and whether it holds in additional national contexts. More specifically, it may be interesting for future work to investigate whether our findings hold in populations that are less polarized or where different cultural norms are at play._x000D_
_x000D_
Conclusion_x000D_
Cooperation is often considered the morally right behavior in public good problems. We propose that the literature has neglected two important qualifications of this claim: Behavior, trust, and norms of cooperation vary based on context and the individuals‚Äô political ideology, which shapes some of their moral convictions55,56. Scholars have presented divergent findings as to whether ideology matters for cooperation, with strong proponents on both sides of the debate. The present research may provide one possible explanation why related findings to date have been inconclusive: The effect of ideology on the willingness to cooperate depends on the context and, more specifically, on features of the public good that individuals cooperate on and that affect collective outcomes. With equality of returns and efficiency, we present two key features that can vary in public goods. At the same time, equality and efficiency concerns are central to many issues at the heart of divides between ideological leftists and rightists. The novel framework of the multiple-public goods game allows us to show how left-leaning and right-leaning individuals trade off equality and efficiency concerns in a social dilemma, and how this affects their levels of cooperation. As relevant avenues to further understand the mechanisms underlying this behavior, we suggest trust as well as normative expectations of others, which seem to reflect individuals‚Äô behavior.","Individuals often face dilemmas in which non-cooperation serves their self-interest and cooperation favors society at large. Cooperation is often considered the moral choice because it creates equality and fairness among citizens. Accordingly, individuals whose political ideology attaches greater value to equality than to agency and self-reliance should not only cooperate on more rather than less efficient public goods, but also more on public goods from which individuals benefit equally rather than unequally. We examine this possibility by comparing ideologically left-leaning and right-leaning individuals‚Äô cooperation on multiple public goods that varied in efficiency and (in)equality in returns. We find that left-leaning individuals cooperate more than right-leaning ones, but only on public goods that benefit everyone equally, and not more on public goods that generate inequalities. Left-leaning individuals also trust and expect others to cooperate more on equal- versus unequal-returns public goods, while self-identified right-leaning individuals do not differentiate between these. Interestingly, ideology does not predict which public good is deemed more morally appropriate to cooperate on. Results combined specify when and why self-identified leftists can(not) be expected to cooperate more than rightists and reveal how moral decision-making depends on structural elements of the public good provision problems that citizens face.","2",0,"2","Political",4,0

The findings indicated that numerous triggers that were active when community members formed cognitive biases. Unsurprisingly, the unprecedented 2019/20 bushfires eventuated in outrage and strengthened the majority of communicated biases. Events of such scale were used to suit a number of arguments including confirming climate change predictions (curse of knowledge, pessimism, confirmation biases); an indicator of political corruption (self-serving) and hope that the fires would be catalyst for positive change (optimism bias). Environmental disaster on a grander scale e.g. ‚Äúend of life‚Äù (pessimism bias) was also highlighted as a trigger for biases. This was also framed in several different ways, including, ‚Äúsecure the future of the planet‚Äù and ‚Äúchange for the sake of the children‚Äù (just-world hypothesis). ‚ÄúSecuring the economy‚Äù was a trigger for curse of knowledge, self-serving and pessimism biases.

While some community members believed that looking after the economy at any cost was a given, others saw a darker side to prioritizing the economy over the environment. Some claimed that proper policy could achieve both a prosperous economy and cleaner environment (optimism bias). Political triggers were also present given the commentary was observed before, during and after an election. Some claimed that Australia could be a beacon of progressive energy and climate policy for the world to follow (optimism bias), while some participants were adamant that lobbyist groups corrupt the policy system for their own benefit (pessimism, self-interest, concision bias). Others claimed that Australia only played a small role in global emission (Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect, confirmation and self-serving bias) and argued that Australians should look after themselves first and let other countries who are greater polluters fix their problems.

5.2 Preferences and their cognitive biases
Table 4 provides a summary of the policy preferences and the underlying cognitive biases. Unsurprisingly, renewables were positioned as the future of energy by climate change supporters, while detractors argue that Australia has an abundance of coal and it should be exploited. Concerns regarding reliability were also raised against the use of renewables and in support of coal, however, supporters of renewables quickly rebutted with battery storage as a simple solution. Those against coal argued that coal‚Äôs time had ‚Äúcome to an end‚Äù, and policy makers needed to think beyond Australia‚Äôs own vested interests and act as responsible global citizens. Nuclear energy had an even amount of supporters and detractors. The underlying reasoning from supporters was that it is was clean energy and Australia has an expansive supply of the raw ingredient, conversely detractors pointed towards needing to deal with the used uranium.

6. Conclusion
This study has demonstrated the value of using social listening to explore cognitive biases and underpinning reasoning among community members in regard to climate change and energy policy debate. A comprehensive analysis of the relationships between the nine dominant cognitive biases evident in energy policy debate in Australia demonstrated how these biases are interconnected. Underlying reasoning was also extracted to understand what arguments underpinned each cognitive bias and what social, economic, environmental and political triggers impacted the formation of cognitive biases. The study confirms former scholarly work that identifies media channels as contributing to bias framing, formation and exacerbation. Energy policy preferences were also identified, with the greatest preference for renewable and clean fusion technologies over traditional forms of energy production, such as coal or gas.

6.1 Challenges for social marketers
The most significant challenge this study identified is how to reconcile cognitive biases that do not operate independently but rather, interact, impact, multiply and resist each other both negatively and positively. This insight is fundamental for marketers to consider because in the action of addressing one component (bias) of a ‚Äúwicked‚Äù problem they may unwittingly compound another, resulting in unforeseen unintended consequences (Gordon et al., 2016; Kennedy et al., 2018). That being said, there were two major challenges facing marketers that would need to be addressed if any significant progress is to be made for the climate and energy debate and policy formation in Australia.

Compounding the complexity of interacting biases, this study identified the influence of Australian media (and hence coverage bias) on every type of bias. This issue is exacerbated by the highly concentrated media environment experienced in Australia. There was evidence of commentary parroting media commentary, and media outlets legitimizing fringe beliefs and providing a platform, to extend reach on non-fact-based argumentation. Such commentary was further compounded by the social media ‚Äúecho-chamber‚Äù. There were numerous instances where community member comments replicated, either verbatim or slightly paraphrased, an excerpt from a media article and/or other social media comment streams. This applied to both left and right-leaning perspectives.

Extending this impact of the media, community commentary did identify that both parties are leveraging the media for their own benefit, making it increasingly unlikely that broad change to media ownership rules will be forthcoming. The findings also highlighted that the public see politicians fearing a potential smear campaign by media outlets if politicians speak out in support of climate change, thus reducing the likelihood of policy changes towards renewable energy. The polarized commentary, cognitive biases and underpinning reasoning indicated that the climate change and energy policy discussion itself is toxic, therefore, attempting to impact individual biases may be moot if media and social influence is not fully addressed.

Another major challenge marketing face is the pandering to the self-interest of powerful stakeholders, which were identified by community members to include two specific stakeholder groups; richer older voting public (baby boomers), and political donors/lobbyists. Commentary aligned with pessimism bias and self-interest bias argued that if politicians do not put the public good ahead of these two groups, there will be minimal chance of shifting the political debate away from ideological positions towards a fact-based debate.

6.2 Implications for marketers
There are three major implications for marketers wanting to influence policy and help reshape the climate and energy policy discussions. First, the representation of strong pessimistic responses suggest that there is a deep emotional connection among community members to the topic, which Schwartz and Loewenstein (2017) suggest can be leveraged to galvanize support. If targeted correctly, such a group can assist in a sustained response and improve behavioural change. Second, marketers could focus on highlighting the negative consequences of self-interest behaviour, and un-picking the complex interaction between policy, self-interest and the media, to dismantle false associations inherent in this group. Third, marketers could leverage situational and contextual factors, such as bushfires, to push the need for policy change. However, caution is required not to overreach as this would potentially lessen support by those occupying a centric position on policy responses to climate change. For example, those supporting nuclear power would be averse to supporting a movement where scientific evidence was not sound. Thus, this would suggest that marketers should not resort to extreme (shock/emotional) messaging, as evidence in this study suggests that such attempts would simply cause an unnecessary divide between left leaning and centric community members.

6.3 Study limitations and future research agenda
The representative nature of social media commentary has been debated; however, this study was looking for breadth of biases. Social media has demonstrated to be effective in scoping range of sentiment, emotions and cognitive bias previously. Second, due to the necessity of manual coding, the breadth of comment extract was kept to a manageable level, as advised by Kozinets (2020). Future studies could focus on extending the amount of data coding using an extensive team of coders or explore increasingly sophisticated machine learning tools. Third, without follow-up qualitative research (e.g. interviews with community members who post comments about climate change), a deeper level of understanding in relation to reasoning behind biases could not be fully determined. Future research may use the social media findings as a basis of discussion during an interview or focus group. Furthermore, future studies have been planned that explicitly focus on attitudes and determine their relationship with biases and to identify if clusters of opposition/support for various climate and energy policy mitigation measures exists.

6.4 Main contribution
This study makes several specific contributions. First, by exploring underpinning reasoning we identified how cognitive biases are intimately connected and not just single entities operating independently of each other. This insight should guide any intervention aimed at combating biases to adopt a systems approach that takes into consideration the flow-on effect of correcting one bias on another bias. Second, the three biases that were most connected were self-serving bias, concision bias and coverage bias. The media play a highly influential role in shaping and fostering biases for and against different climate and energy policy solutions. This is achieved by media outlet positioning solutions in a particular light and allowing specific voices to be heard. Third, different media outlets foster different mindsets. The centric audience wanted solutions that were based on common-sense and were adamant that decisions should be made based on the common good. Left-leaning audiences were more pessimistic about the future of climate and energy policy in Australia and blamed powerful self-interest for the lack of progressive policy. Right-leaning audience appeared to be more willing to willfully believe those in power, this was driven by apparent self-interest. Fourth, key triggers for biases included crisis events such as flooding and bushfires, while social triggers include political meddling, sense of community security and economic triggers, such as, job creation, cost of living and long-term cost of inaction. Finally, the use of social media commentary dataset was successful in revealing cognitive biases and associated reasonings. These findings have important implications in that current social marketing approaches mostly target downstream communication and do not focus heavily on the interconnected systems of media and stakeholder interactions with policy makers.","Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to examine how upstream social marketing can benefit from using social media commentary to identify cognitive biases. Using reactions to leading media/news publications/articles related to climate and energy policy in Australia, this paper aims to understand underlying community cognitive biases and their reasonings.

Design/methodology/approach
Social listening was used to gather community commentary about climate and energy policy in Australia. This allowed the coding of natural language data to determine underlying cognitive biases inherent in the community. In all, 2,700 Facebook comments were collected from 27 news articles dated between January 2018 and March 2020 using exportcomments.com. Team coding was used to ensure consistency in interpretation.

Findings
Nine key cognitive bias were noted, including, pessimism, just-world, confirmation, optimum, curse of knowledge, Dunning‚ÄìKruger, self-serving, concision and converge biases. Additionally, the authors report on the interactive nature of these biases. Right-leaning audiences are perceived to be willfully uninformed and motivated by self-interest; centric audiences want solutions based on common-sense for the common good; and left-leaning supporters of progressive climate change policy are typically pessimistic about the future of climate and energy policy in Australia. Impacts of powerful media organization shaping biases are also explored.

Research limitations/implications
Through a greater understanding of the types of cognitive biases, policy-makers are able to better design and execute influential upstream social marketing campaigns.

Originality/value
The study demonstrates that observing cognitive biases through social listening can assist upstream social marketing understand community biases and underlying reasonings towards climate and energy policy.","6",1,"2","Political",3,0

In recent years, the topic of cryptocurrencies has been one of the most frequently discussed subjects, both among legal scholars and in the mainstream media. These ‚Äúdigital units of value‚Äù are not backed by any central authority or tangible assets, but are rather created and managed through decentralized systems using cryptographic techniques. The most popular among them, Bitcoin, was developed in 2008 and soon became a global phenomenon, inspiring a multitude of alternative cryptocurrencies.

However, as cryptocurrencies continued to grow in number and popularity, concerns emerged regarding their use for illegal activities, lack of consumer protection, volatility, and the inability of states to control or regulate their circulation effectively. To address these issues, governments and central banks around the world began to explore the concept of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), which, unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, are issued and controlled by a central authority.

This paper seeks to address the legal status of such national digital currencies by exploring the difference between a ‚Äúmeans of payment‚Äù and ‚Äúlegal tender‚Äù, and by analysing selected national examples where such currencies have been developed, piloted, or proposed. The comparative approach is taken with the aim of identifying trends and key regulatory issues in the development of CBDCs, which could contribute to a better understanding of the potential and challenges of a digital euro or other supra-national digital currencies. 2. Means of payment vs. legal tender

Before examining individual examples of CBDCs and other national cryptocurrencies, it is necessary to define the terms ‚Äúmeans of payment‚Äù and ‚Äúlegal tender‚Äù, and to examine the consequences of a certain payment instrument being qualified as one or the other.

In general terms, a means of payment can be understood as any instrument or method used to settle a monetary obligation between parties. This can include traditional fiat currencies (coins and banknotes), electronic money, credit cards, cheques, and more recently, cryptocurrencies. The use of these instruments as means of payment depends primarily on the agreement between the parties involved in a transaction. For example, a shop may agree to accept a gift card or cryptocurrency as payment, even though these are not officially recognized as currency.

In contrast, the term legal tender has a specific legal meaning: it refers to a form of payment that must be accepted if offered in settlement of a debt. In most jurisdictions, this status is granted exclusively to the currency issued by the national central bank or monetary authority. Legal tender laws ensure that creditors cannot refuse such payments when offered in full for a debt.

The distinction has significant implications. A payment method that is not legal tender can still be widely used (e.g. PayPal, store credit), but its acceptance is always subject to mutual agreement. On the other hand, if an instrument is recognized as legal tender, its use cannot be refused in the discharge of monetary obligations, which gives it a privileged position in the economy.

Consequently, for a CBDC or national cryptocurrency to be granted legal tender status, it must be recognized as such by the national legislation, not just be technologically feasible or functionally accepted. This legal qualification affects  not only the instrument‚Äôs role in commerce, but also its regulatory framework, user rights, and the obligations of recipients.  3. National virtual currencies and CBDCs ‚Äì an overview of selected jurisdictions

As central banks around the world began exploring the potential of digital currencies, several countries took the lead in launching pilot projects or even fully implementing sovereign digital currencies. The legal status and regulatory treatment of these national virtual currencies vary significantly.

3.1. Venezuela ‚Äì Petro

Venezuela became the first country to officially launch a state-backed cryptocurrency called the Petro in 2018. The Petro was allegedly backed by the country‚Äôs oil reserves and was intended to circumvent international sanctions and stabilize the national economy. However, the Petro was met with skepticism both domestically and internationally. The Venezuelan National Assembly declared it illegal, and international analysts questioned its transparency, technological viability, and connection to actual oil reserves.

In terms of legal status, the Petro was intended to function both as a means of payment and as legal tender. The government required certain payments, such as taxes and fuel, to be made in Petros. Despite this, the lack of public trust, insufficient infrastructure, and political instability hindered the widespread adoption of the currency. Today, the Petro remains in circulation but plays a marginal role in Venezuela‚Äôs monetary system.

3.2. African countries

Several African countries have also explored national virtual currencies. For example, Tunisia was one of the first to announce the development of a digital currency called the eDinar, and Senegal followed with the eCFA. These currencies were developed with the support of private blockchain companies but did not function as full CBDCs under the control of central banks. Instead, they resembled public-private partnerships aiming to digitize existing currencies.

Other African countries, such as Nigeria, have moved further. In 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria launched the eNaira, a digital version of the Nigerian naira. The eNaira was declared legal tender and is issued directly by the Central Bank. The government promoted its use in various sectors, including social benefits and government payments. However, concerns about privacy, cybersecurity, and digital literacy remain significant barriers to its broader use. 
3.3. Uruguay ‚Äì e-Peso

Uruguay was among the first countries to conduct a CBDC pilot project with the introduction of the e-Peso in 2017. The pilot program was launched by the Central Bank of Uruguay and involved the issuance of digital cash equivalent to the Uruguayan peso. It was designed for general use, allowing users to make payments via mobile phones using digital wallets.

The project was limited in scope and time, serving as a technical and legal feasibility test rather than a full rollout. The e-Peso had a legal basis under existing legislation, as it was issued and backed by the Central Bank and was equivalent to traditional money. However, it was not granted formal legal tender status beyond the pilot phase.

Despite its limited duration, the e-Peso project provided valuable insights into the technological and regulatory challenges of CBDC implementation and remains a reference point for later initiatives in Latin America and beyond.

3.4. China ‚Äì Digital Yuan (e-CNY)

China has been at the forefront of CBDC development with the ongoing rollout of the e-CNY, or digital yuan. The People‚Äôs Bank of China began research in 2014 and launched a series of pilot programs starting in 2020 in major cities such as Shenzhen, Suzhou, and Beijing. The digital yuan is issued by the central bank and distributed through state-owned commercial banks.

The e-CNY is intended to function as legal tender alongside traditional renminbi banknotes and coins. Its legal status was formalized in draft legislation in 2020. China‚Äôs approach emphasizes controllability, traceability, and programmability, aiming to support anti-money laundering efforts, reduce transaction costs, and provide a state-controlled alternative to private payment platforms like Alipay and WeChat Pay.

However, the system has raised concerns regarding privacy, as the central bank can potentially track all e-CNY transactions. The Chinese model is often described as a two-tiered system, in which the central bank issues the currency and intermediaries manage distribution to the public.

3.5. The European Union ‚Äì digital euro

The European Central Bank (ECB) has been exploring the idea of introducing a digital euro as a complement to cash. In 2021, the ECB launched an investigation phase to assess potential design features, use cases, and legal frameworks.

The digital euro would aim to preserve the role of public money in a digital age and ensure monetary sovereignty within the euro area. It is envisioned to be legal tender, accessible to all citizens, and offered through banks and payment service providers. Key considerations include privacy, interoperability, financial inclusion, and preventing disintermediation of the banking system.

While no final decision has yet been made, the digital euro project reflects a cautious but serious move toward a European CBDC. The legal foundations would likely require amendments to EU legislation and coordination among eurozone members. 4. Legal and regulatory challenges

The comparative review of national CBDC projects highlights several recurring legal and regulatory challenges that must be addressed for any digital currency‚Äîparticularly one with legal tender status‚Äîto be successfully implemented and widely adopted.

4.1. Legal tender status and monetary law

For a CBDC to function effectively as legal tender, national or supranational legislation must clearly define its status. This involves not only technical and economic considerations but also constitutional and legal questions related to monetary sovereignty and the exclusive rights of central banks to issue currency.

Some countries, like China and Nigeria, have already recognized their CBDCs as legal tender, while others, like the EU, are still assessing the legal implications. Legal certainty is essential to ensure enforceability in transactions and to support public trust and acceptance.

4.2. Privacy and data protection

One of the most frequently cited concerns in relation to CBDCs is the issue of privacy. Unlike cash, which allows for anonymous transactions, digital currencies often leave a digital trace. While some level of traceability may be necessary to combat illicit activities, excessive surveillance may infringe on fundamental rights and dissuade users from adopting the currency.

Balancing anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) requirements with the right to privacy is therefore crucial. Some suggest a tiered privacy approach, where smaller transactions enjoy greater anonymity while larger ones are subject to stricter scrutiny.

4.3. Consumer protection and cybersecurity

Ensuring robust consumer protection mechanisms is vital, especially in cases where users lack digital literacy. Systems must be transparent, easy to use, and provide recourse in case of errors or fraud. Regulatory frameworks need to clarify liability in the case of technical failures or cybersecurity breaches.

Moreover, cybersecurity is a major technical challenge. CBDCs represent critical infrastructure and could be targeted by malicious actors. High-level security standards must be implemented to prevent attacks and preserve the integrity of digital monetary systems.

4.4. Impact on the financial system

CBDCs could significantly impact the traditional banking sector. If citizens move large portions of their deposits from commercial banks to central bank digital wallets, banks might experience reduced liquidity and lending capacity‚Äîa phenomenon referred to as disintermediation.

To mitigate this risk, some models propose caps on CBDC holdings or non-interest-bearing designs to reduce incentives to move funds away from commercial banks. The ECB and other central banks are actively studying these implications to design systems that complement, rather than disrupt, existing financial ecosystems. 5. Conclusion

The development and implementation of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and other forms of national virtual currencies mark a significant shift in the landscape of modern monetary systems. While technological feasibility is no longer in question, the legal status and regulatory framework of such currencies remain complex and often unsettled.

This paper has demonstrated that many countries are approaching CBDC development with different objectives and legal strategies. Some, such as China and Nigeria, have already granted their digital currencies legal tender status, thereby elevating them to the same level as cash and banknotes. Others, such as the European Union, remain in an exploratory phase, seeking to establish a framework that balances innovation with legal certainty, privacy, consumer protection, and financial stability.

A key distinction that continues to shape this field is that between ‚Äúmeans of payment‚Äù and ‚Äúlegal tender.‚Äù This distinction has both practical and legal consequences. As shown in the various national examples, not all digital currencies automatically acquire legal tender status; such status must be expressly provided for in law and supported by appropriate regulatory frameworks.

The emergence of CBDCs presents significant legal challenges‚Äîfrom questions of monetary law, data privacy, and cybersecurity, to the impact on the financial system. Yet, they also offer an opportunity to modernize and democratize access to public money, especially in the context of declining cash use and growing reliance on private digital payment systems.

As legal scholars, regulators, and policymakers continue to monitor and shape the development of CBDCs, comparative legal research such as this may offer valuable insights into how digital currencies can be integrated into national and supranational legal systems in a way that is efficient, fair, and legally robust.
","This discussion paper considers the monetary role that cryptocurrencies can play as hedges against the crises stemming from hyperinflation. It also briefly examines such a relationship vis-a-vis currency devaluation and monetary defaults. The findings suggest that, for all the legitimate criticisms volleyed against cryptocurrencies (governance, legal, security), there are indeed certain macroeconomic issues which can draw upon the decentralized, apolitical, and deflationary monetary nature of cryptocurrencies. These advantages must then be weighted by monetary policy practitioners against the risks that still linger in the cryptocurrency space.","Apolitical",1,"4","Political",4,1

Although it is the largest systematic study contrasting ranked timelines with chronological ones on Twitter, our work fits into a broader context of research on the effects of content personalization on political content (2, 3, 9, 21) and polarization (35‚Äì38). There are several avenues for future work. Apart from the Home timeline, Twitter users are exposed to several other forms of algorithmic content curation on the platform that merit study through similar experiments.

We provide quantitative evidence from a long-running, massive-scale randomized experiment on the Twitter platform that committed a randomized control group including nearly 2 million daily active accounts to a reverse-chronological content feed free of algorithmic personalization. We present two sets of findings. First, we studied tweets by elected legislators from major political parties in seven countries. Our results reveal a remarkably consistent trend: In six out of seven countries studied, the mainstream political right enjoys higher algorithmic amplification than the mainstream political left. Consistent with this overall trend, our second set of findings studying the US media landscape revealed that algorithmic amplification favors right-leaning news sources. We further looked at whether algorithms amplify far-left and far-right political groups more than moderate ones; contrary to prevailing public belief, we did not find evidence to support this hypothesis. We hope our findings will contribute to an evidence-based debate on the role personalization algorithms play in shaping political content consumption.","7",1,"4","Political",4,0

Journal of Personality, 91(3), 838‚Äì855. https://doi.org/10.1111/jopy.12780","4.1 General stability of primals during the pandemic
In this longitudinal, quasi-experimental study, we tested whether the initial shock of the pandemic and individual levels of experienced adversity was associated with changes in primal world beliefs. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find evidence that primals became substantially more negative for the average person during the initial phase of the pandemic (Figures 2b,c, and 3). Primals were surprisingly stable, except that participants saw the world as slightly less Alive, Interactive, and Acceptable. Most strikingly, despite a global increase in danger, the general belief that the world is Safe (vs. Dangerous) did not change. These findings may suggest that primals are trait-like, stable characteristics of individuals rather than flexible states that dynamically adapt to the current context (see also Poulin & Silver, 2019). COVID-19 may have changed the world in many ways, but it does not appear to have had much impact on what people believe about it, at least within the first half year of the pandemic.

Surprisingly, there were a greater number of significant changes in primals in the non-pandemic comparison sample than in the pandemic sample. Although the comparison sample was not matched in duration or occurrence of major events to the pandemic sample, these findings underscore the overall resilience of primals during the early phases of a world-wide shock to the system. We note that determining exactly why and which changes occurred in the non-pandemic sample is beyond the scope of the current paper although we offer some ideas on this further below.

4.2 Small adversity-related changes in primals
Despite primals' overall stability, people who reported many adverse experiences (e.g., job loss) showed some small changes in primals. The more adversity people experienced, the less Good, Safe, Progressing, Cooperative, Just, and Abundant they tended to see the world, and the more they thought the world Needs Them and was Changing. Moreover, there were interaction effects between adversity and T1-beliefs for the primals Good, Stable, Just, Worth Exploring, Improvable, and Understandable. People with more positive beliefs before the pandemic who then experienced greater adversity subsequently reported more negative shifts in beliefs compared to people with comparable levels of adversity but more negative initial beliefs. This fits with Janoff-Bulman's (1992) suggestion that people with more positive assumptions about the world might‚Äîat least initially after a trauma‚Äîexperience stronger degradation of these assumptions compared to those who already had negative views before the event (of note, she suggested that these individuals may also recover more quickly).1 All changes found here, however, were small.

4.3 Considerations regarding the significance of the small changes
In the depression intervention literature, effects of the size found for general and adversity-related effects in this study (max. 0.16 SD change, most around 0.1 SD change) are typically not considered clinically meaningful (Cuijpers et al., 2014). In the individual differences literature, by contrast, effect sizes similar to the ones found here have been interpreted as more meaningful (Hudson & Fraley, 2015). Funder and Ozer (2019) recently pointed out that smaller effect sizes in psychology should not be discarded as meaningless, since they may accumulate over time or across people and have important long-term impacts. This may be particularly relevant for highly general beliefs such as primals which likely impinge on a wide range of behaviors, and given the large proportion of the global population who were affected by adversity during the pandemic. Indeed, in a supplementary analysis (Table S9), we found that most primals at T1 correlated with lifetime trauma experienced prior to T1 (max. r = ‚àí0.28). This suggests that cumulative trauma or adversity across long time periods may indeed lead to increasingly negative primal beliefs from small to moderate degrees.

It is also possible that the small declines we did observe might not endure. As such, it could be that as individuals' mental health improves, so too will their beliefs about the world‚Äîin those few cases in which changes did occur at all. However, we note that our data were sampled relatively early in the pandemic. It is also possible that the protracted societal disruptions caused people to experience more adversity or declining negative mental health, which may lead to more severe or enduring primal changes. For example, one study of the psychological effects of the global financial crisis found that participants' depression was worse in the declining stage of the crisis than it was at its peak (Sargent-Cox et al., 2011). Further research should investigate this question and should aim to determine the causal direction of interactions between adversity, mental health, and primals (Clifton, 2020a; Clifton & Kim, 2020). Thus, the impact of the small changes in primal world beliefs observed here will depend on whether they stabilize, accumulate over time, or return to baseline after the pandemic.

4.4 Different types of adversity have different effects on primals
During the early stages of the pandemic, people differed not only in how many adverse events they experienced, but also in what challenges they faced. Our finding that various kinds of adversity had different effects on primals (Material S4) suggests that when it comes to influencing how people see the world, not all experiences are created equal (Janoff-Bulman, 1992; Poulin & Silver, 2019).

This could offer one potential explanation for some of the differences between the pandemic and the non-pandemic time period. Many hardships experienced in the first half of 2020 (e.g., the virus, social isolation) were unique to this timeframe, whereas the non-pandemic sample (2015‚Äì2017) experienced a different set of unique societal/political upheavals. Possibly, pandemic-specific types of adversity were less potent for inducing changes in beliefs about the world. Indeed, we found very few primal changes after social isolation, social stress (e.g., in one's household during lock-down), bereavement, and for those at increased risk to their health. In contrast, violence or financial stress‚Äîwhich might have been relatively prevalent during the non-pandemic time as well‚Äîwere associated with numerous small primal changes.

Further, although primals are purportedly beliefs about the world as a whole, it is not yet clear which categories of objects, people, or places most inform these beliefs. For example, primals may reflect what people believe about the natural world, the social world, some combination of the two, or possibly some other conceptualization of what the world entails. If primals are primarily concerned with the social world, one may predict that societal and political conflicts would have stronger impacts on primals than threats from the natural world. This would be consistent with our finding that there was a greater decline in primals during the socially and politically tumultuous time during which our non-pandemic sample completed their surveys, although there was notable social upheaval in 2020 as well (e.g., the ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù protests).

The exploratory nature of this analysis makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Future research should continue to explore what aspects of the world most inform the content of primals and should further tease apart the impact of various types of adversity on beliefs about the world.

4.5 Implications for psychological theory
Our hypotheses that the global disruption caused by the pandemic and the individual adversity one experienced as a result would predict negative changes in a person's primals were based on so-called retrospective accounts of belief formation, which postulate that people will update their beliefs in response to substantial changes in the environment and/or individually traumatic events (see Clifton, 2020b; Duckitt & Sibley, 2009; Janoff-Bulman, 1989, 1992; Kaler et al., 2008). Our study offers only limited support for such accounts. Despite widespread global upheaval, we did not find any evidence for a general trend toward believing the world is worse than it was before the pandemic. Our finding that individual adversity did predict a negative change in primals is consistent with retrospective accounts of belief formation; however, the effects were smaller than prior theories might suggest, and it is unclear how robust and enduring these changes will be. World beliefs overall were not altered by a highly disruptive world event.

Instead, our findings may accord more with interpretive accounts of primal world belief formation. These hold that primals serve as lenses through which we see the world and thus are relatively insensitive to evidence or experience (Clifton, 2020b; Poulin & Silver, 2019). As a speculation, for someone who sees the world as Safe, the pandemic might be interpreted as exceptional and temporary, or this person may pay more attention to information reinforcing their prior beliefs (e.g., reading up on vaccine safety). For someone who sees the world as Dangerous, by contrast, the pandemic might demonstrate something obvious they knew all along, and they may pay more attention to information reinforcing that belief (Nickerson, 1998). This view can be linked to findings that personality traits tend not to show consistent patterns of change in response to major life events (Denissen et al., 2019), and with meta-analytic evidence that ‚Äústrong situations‚Äù do not overwhelm individual differences in how people construe events nearly as much as prior theorizing suggested (Keeler et al., 2019). This may also be because individual differences in primals might relate to individual variation in underlying brain biology‚Äîbut precisely how remains to be determined.

It is worth noting that although the present study has focused on the resilience of positive primal world beliefs, our findings also suggest that negative beliefs about the world may be stubbornly resistant to change even when there is evidence to the contrary. For example, most people believe that the world is getting poorer, even though extreme poverty has significantly declined in recent decades (Roser, 2018). For people who believe the world is Dangerous, Competitive, and getting Worse, it may be hard to persuade them otherwise. Future research should investigate whether major, positive life events (global and/or individual) lead to changes in primal world beliefs.

4.6 Constraints on generality
We note that our participants were sampled on MTurk, which comes with certain biases, such as different levels of depression and anxiety compared to the general population (Engle et al., 2020). While the potential limitations need to be kept in mind, MTurk has been found to be a reliable and efficient source for data (Mortensen & Hughes, 2018), particularly as we conducted rigorous data quality checks. Most importantly, in this case, the availability of pre-pandemic data constituted a unique opportunity to test the effects of the pandemic on primals, outweighing limitations.

Regarding the generalizability of our study, our sample did cover various ages, genders, and ethnic groups, albeit it was primarily (76%) White, substantially more Democrats than Republicans, and exclusively American. It is possible that our results would be different, for example, for only Black participants or those with very low socioeconomic status‚Äîpeople who were disproportionately negatively affected by the pandemic. It is possible that members of these groups would experience stronger average primal changes based on higher average adversity scores and fewer resources to buffer negative effects of the pandemic: future research should address this. However, when considering the income data of our sample, most participants were not wealthy, but rather on an average or below-average level compared to other Americans. Moreover, the relation between adversity and primal changes, as investigated here, might be expected to be the same in various groups.

Additionally, we observed some non-random attrition at T2, which is another limitation of this research (see Material S2, Table S11, and Figure S8 for details). For example, participants with more trauma at T1 and Black participants were more likely to drop out of the study. Due to this‚Äîas well as due to relatively low participation of Black and Hispanic/Latino individuals at baseline‚Äîthe average adversity experienced in this study might be underestimated (Fraiman et al., 2021; Goldmann et al., 2021; Grooms et al., 2021).

We expect results would generalize to adults in other Western democracies that experienced similar societal disruptions because of the pandemic, but of course it is unknown whether similar results would be found in non-WEIRD countries [WEIRD: Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic], or in places that experienced a higher or lower level of COVID-19-related adversity.

4.7 Suggestions for future research
There are several interesting follow-up questions to this study. One, as mentioned above, is whether the small adversity-related effects that we identified stabilize or even accumulate over time, or whether they revert to baseline levels. Another question concerns how other types of beliefs, such as those about one's own self or about ‚Äúmy world‚Äù rather than ‚Äúthe world in general,‚Äù may have changed during the pandemic. Moreover, one may ask which factors can buffer the small negative effects of adversity on primals, including for example social support (Valentiner et al., 1994). Furthermore, we replicated here previous findings of a clear link between low mental health and more negative primals, which were both associated with increased adversity. Researchers should elucidate this link further. One may ask, for example, whether adversity causes mental health issues, which then lead to more negative primals, or whether adversity increases negative beliefs, which then lead to mental health issues, or whether both are true. Finally, one may investigate whether age plays a role in how malleable beliefs are. Specifically, it is possible that children experience larger changes in primals than adults in response to global adverse events (e.g., see Poulin & Silver, 2019; Rini et al., 2004).

4.8 Concluding remarks
If general beliefs about the world play a crucial role for mental health and well-being, as has been proposed by several scholars, it is critical to understand how these world beliefs arise and how they can change. If they are strongly impacted by objective world conditions, then the path to positive beliefs (and theoretically, increased well-being) may be to, quite simply, make the world objectively better‚Äîless dangerous, more abundant, and so forth. However, our findings indicate remarkable resilience of primal world beliefs during extreme global change, at least initially and in a primarily White American sample. For example, though the world became objectively more dangerous, the belief that the world is Dangerous did not increase. This finding parallels research showing that objective improvements in quality of living do not necessarily result in corresponding improvements in subjective well-being (Easterbrook, 2003). Improving the world is per se a good idea, but it is unlikely to be sufficient for boosting people's well-being without attending to how people experience and perceive those changes.

Our findings resonate with the consistency of personality traits over the life course as well as postulated homeostatic functions of spiritual and religious beliefs for navigating hardship during crisis. This resilience offers hope for psychological recovery after a once-in-a-century pandemic (see also Bonanno & Mancini, 2008; Luchetti et al., 2020). However, we also found some evidence that personal adversity (particularly financial hardship or violence) leads to a slight degradation of beliefs. With the effects of climate change and other societal disruptions likely to be acutely felt by billions more people in the years ahead, it is more important than ever that we understand whether such changes will endure and what might help people have more hope for a better world.","Introduction_x000D_
People hold general beliefs about the world called primals (e.g., the world is Safe, Intentional), which are strongly linked to individual differences in personality, behavior, and mental health. How such beliefs form or change across the lifespan is largely unknown, although theory suggests that beliefs become more negative after disruptive events. The COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity to test whether dramatic world changes and personal adversity affect beliefs._x000D_

Method_x000D_
In a longitudinal, quasi-experimental, pre-registered design, 529 US participants (51% female, 76% White) provided ratings of primals before and several months after pandemic onset, and information about personal adversity (e.g., losing family, financial hardship). Data were compared to 398 participants without experience of the pandemic._x000D_
_x000D_
Results_x000D_
The average person in our sample showed no change in 23 of the 26 primals, including Safe, in response to the early pandemic, and only saw the world as slightly less Alive, Interactive, and Acceptable. Higher adversity, however, was associated with slight declines in some beliefs. One limitation is that participants were exclusively American._x000D_

Contrary to our hypoth-esis, we did not find evidence that primals became sub-stantially more negative for the average person during theinitial phase of the pandemic (Figures 2b,c, and 3). Primalswere surprisingly stable, except that participants saw theworld as slightly less Alive, Interactive, and Acceptable.Most strikingly, despite a global increase in danger, thegeneral belief that the world is Safe (vs. Dangerous) didnot change. These findings may suggest that primals aretrait-like, stable characteristics of individuals rather thanflexible states that dynamically adapt to the current con-text (see also Poulin & Silver, 2019). COVID-19 may havechanged the world in many ways, but it does not appear tohave had much impact on what people believe about it, atleast within the first half year of the pandemic.Surprisingly, there were a greater number of significantchanges in primals in the non-pandemic comparison sam-ple than in the pandemic sample. Although the compari-son sample was not matched in duration or occurrence ofmajor events to the pandemic sample, these findings un-derscore the overall resilience of primals during the earlyphases of a world-wide shock to the system. We note thatdetermining exactly why and which changes occurred inthe non-pandemic sample is beyond the scope of the cur-rent paper although we offer some ideas on this furtherbelow.                                   

4.2 | Small adversity-related changesin primalsDespite primals' overall stability, people who reportedmany adverse experiences (e.g., job loss) showed somesmall changes in primals. The more adversity people expe-rienced, the less Good, Safe, Progressing, Cooperative, Just,and Abundant they tended to see the world, and the morethey thought the world Needs Them and was Changing.Moreover, there were interaction effects between ad-versity and T1-beliefs for the primals Good, Stable, Just,Worth Exploring, Improvable, and Understandable. Peoplewith more positive beliefs before the pandemic who thenexperienced greater adversity subsequently reportedmore negative shifts in beliefs compared to people withcomparable levels of adversity but more negative initialbeliefs. This fits with Janoff-Bulman's (1992) suggestionthat people with more positive assumptions about theworld might‚Äîat least initially after a trauma‚Äîexperiencestronger degradation of these assumptions compared tothose who already had negative views before the event(of note, she suggested that these individuals may also re-cover more quickly).1 All changes found here, however,were small. 

4.3 | Considerations regarding thesignificance of the small changesIn the depression intervention literature, effects of thesize found for general and adversity-related effects inthis study (max. 0.16 SD change, most around 0.1 SDchange) are typically not considered clinically meaning-ful (Cuijpers et al., 2014). In the individual differencesliterature, by contrast, effect sizes similar to the ones found here have been interpreted as more meaningful(Hudson & Fraley, 2015). Funder and Ozer (2019) re-cently pointed out that smaller effect sizes in psychologyshould not be discarded as meaningless, since they mayaccumulate over time or across people and have impor-tant long-term impacts. This may be particularly relevantfor highly general beliefs such as primals which likely im-pinge on a wide range of behaviors, and given the largeproportion of the global population who were affected byadversity during the pandemic. Indeed, in a supplemen-tary analysis (Table S9), we found that most primals at T1correlated with lifetime trauma experienced prior to T1(max. r = ‚àí0.28). This suggests that cumulative traumaor adversity across long time periods may indeed lead toincreasingly negative primal beliefs from small to moder-ate degrees.It is also possible that the small declines we did ob-serve might not endure. As such, it could be that as indi-viduals' mental health improves, so too will their beliefsabout the world‚Äîin those few cases in which changes didoccur at all. However, we note that our data were sam-pled relatively early in the pandemic. It is also possiblethat the protracted societal disruptions caused people toexperience more adversity or declining negative mentalhealth, which may lead to more severe or enduring primalchanges. For example, one study of the psychological ef-fects of the global financial crisis found that participants'depression was worse in the declining stage of the crisisthan it was at its peak (Sargent- Cox et al., 2011). Furtherresearch should investigate this question and should aimto determine the causal direction of interactions betweenadversity, mental health, and primals (Clifton, 2020a;Clifton & Kim, 2020). Thus, the impact of the smallchanges in primal world beliefs observed here will dependon whether they stabilize, accumulate over time, or returnto baseline after the pandemic.

4.4 | Different types of adversity havedifferent effects on primalsDuring the early stages of the pandemic, people differednot only in how many adverse events they experienced,but also in what challenges they faced. Our finding thatvarious kinds of adversity had different effects on primals(Material S4) suggests that when it comes to influencinghow people see the world, not all experiences are createdequal (Janoff- Bulman,1992; Poulin & Silver, 2019).This could offer one potential explanation for someof the differences between the pandemic and the non-pandemic time period. Many hardships experienced inthe first half of 2020 (e.g., the virus, social isolation) wereunique to this timeframe, whereas the non-pandemicsample (2015‚Äì2017) experienced a different set of uniquesocietal/political upheavals. Possibly, pandemic-specifictypes of adversity were less potent for inducing changes inbeliefs about the world. Indeed, we found very few primalchanges after social isolation, social stress (e.g., in one'shousehold during lock-down), bereavement, and for thoseat increased risk to their health. In contrast, violence orfinancial stress‚Äîwhich might have been relatively preva-lent during the non-pandemic time as well‚Äîwere associ-ated with numerous small primal changes.Further, although primals are purportedly beliefs aboutthe world as a whole, it is not yet clear which categoriesof objects, people, or places most inform these beliefs. Forexample, primals may reflect what people believe aboutthe natural world, the social world, some combination ofthe two, or possibly some other conceptualization of whatthe world entails. If primals are primarily concerned withthe social world, one may predict that societal and politi-cal conflicts would have stronger impacts on primals thanthreats from the natural world. This would be consistentwith our finding that there was a greater decline in pri-mals during the socially and politically tumultuous timeduring which our non-pandemic sample completed theirsurveys, although there was notable social upheaval in2020 as well (e.g., the ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù protests).The exploratory nature of this analysis makes it dif-ficult to draw firm conclusions. Future research shouldcontinue to explore what aspects of the world most informthe content of primals and should further tease apart theimpact of various types of adversity on beliefs about theworld.

4.5 | Implications for psychologicaltheoryOur hypotheses that the global disruption caused by thepandemic and the individual adversity one experiencedas a result would predict negative changes in a person'sprimals were based on so-called retrospective accountsof belief formation, which postulate that people will up-date their beliefs in response to substantial changes inthe environment and/or individually traumatic events(see Clifton, 2020b; Duckitt & Sibley, 2009; Janoff-Bulman, 1989, 1992; Kaler et al., 2008). Our study offersonly limited support for such accounts. Despite wide-spread global upheaval, we did not find any evidencefor a general trend toward believing the world is worsethan it was before the pandemic. Our finding that indi-vidual adversity did predict a negative change in primalsis consistent with retrospective accounts of belief forma-tion; however, the effects were smaller than prior theoriesmight suggest, and it is unclear how robust and enduring these changes will be. World beliefs overall were not al-tered by a highly disruptive world event.Instead, our findings may accord more with interpre-tive accounts of primal world belief formation. Thesehold that primals serve as lenses through which we seethe world and thus are relatively insensitive to evidenceor experience (Clifton, 2020b; Poulin & Silver, 2019). Asa speculation, for someone who sees the world as Safe,the pandemic might be interpreted as exceptional andtemporary, or this person may pay more attention to in-formation reinforcing their prior beliefs (e.g., readingup on vaccine safety). For someone who sees the worldas Dangerous, by contrast, the pandemic might demon-strate something obvious they knew all along, and theymay pay more attention to information reinforcing thatbelief (Nickerson, 1998). This view can be linked to find-ings that personality traits tend not to show consistent pat-terns of change in response to major life events (Denissenet al., 2019), and with meta-analytic evidence that ‚Äústrongsituations‚Äù do not overwhelm individual differences inhow people construe events nearly as much as prior the-orizing suggested (Keeler et al., 2019). This may also bebecause individual differences in primals might relate toindividual variation in underlying brain biology‚Äîbut pre-cisely how remains to be determined.It is worth noting that although the present studyhas focused on the resilience of positive primal worldbeliefs, our findings also suggest that negative beliefsabout the world may be stubbornly resistant to changeeven when there is evidence to the contrary. For exam-ple, most people believe that the world is getting poorer,even though extreme poverty has significantly declinedin recent decades (Roser, 2018). For people who believethe world is Dangerous, Competitive, and getting Worse,it may be hard to persuade them otherwise. Future re-search should investigate whether major, positive lifeevents (global and/or individual) lead to changes in pri-mal world beliefs.

4.6 | Constraints on generalityWe note that our participants were sampled on MTurk,which comes with certain biases, such as different lev-els of depression and anxiety compared to the generalpopulation (Engle et al., 2020). While the potential limi-tations need to be kept in mind, MTurk has been foundto be a reliable and efficient source for data (Mortensen& Hughes, 2018), particularly as we conducted rigorousdata quality checks. Most importantly, in this case, theavailability of pre- pandemic data constituted a unique op-portunity to test the effects of the pandemic on primals,outweighing limitations.Regarding the generalizability of our study, our sam-ple did cover various ages, genders, and ethnic groups,albeit it was primarily (76%) White, substantially moreDemocrats than Republicans, and exclusively American.It is possible that our results would be different, for ex-ample, for only Black participants or those with very lowsocioeconomic status‚Äîpeople who were disproportion-ately negatively affected by the pandemic. It is possiblethat members of these groups would experience strongeraverage primal changes based on higher average adversityscores and fewer resources to buffer negative effects of thepandemic: future research should address this. However,when considering the income data of our sample, mostparticipants were not wealthy, but rather on an averageor below-average level compared to other Americans.Moreover, the relation between adversity and primalchanges, as investigated here, might be expected to be thesame in various groups.Additionally, we observed some non-random attritionat T2, which is another limitation of this research (seeMaterial S2, Table S11, and Figure S8 for details). For ex-ample, participants with more trauma at T1 and Blackparticipants were more likely to drop out of the study. Dueto this‚Äîas well as due to relatively low participation ofBlack and Hispanic/Latino individuals at baseline‚Äîtheaverage adversity experienced in this study might be un-derestimated (Fraiman et al., 2021; Goldmann et al., 2021;Grooms et al., 2021).We expect results would generalize to adults in otherWestern democracies that experienced similar societaldisruptions because of the pandemic, but of course it isunknown whether similar results would be found in non-WEIRD countries [WEIRD: Western, educated, industri-alized, rich, and democratic], or in places that experienceda higher or lower level of COVID-19-related adversity.

4.7 | Suggestions for future researchThere are several interesting follow-up questions to thisstudy. One, as mentioned above, is whether the smalladversity-related effects that we identified stabilize oreven accumulate over time, or whether they revert tobaseline levels. Another question concerns how othertypes of beliefs, such as those about one's own self orabout ‚Äúmy world‚Äù rather than ‚Äúthe world in general,‚Äùmay have changed during the pandemic. Moreover, onemay ask which factors can buffer the small negative ef-fects of adversity on primals, including for example socialsupport (Valentiner et al., 1994). Furthermore, we repli-cated here previous findings of a clear link between lowmental health and more negative primals, which wereboth associated with increased adversity. Researchers should elucidate this link further. One may ask, for ex-ample, whether adversity causes mental health issues,which then lead to more negative primals, or whether ad-versity increases negative beliefs, which then lead to men-tal health issues, or whether both are true. Finally, onemay investigate whether age plays a role in how malleablebeliefs are. Specifically, it is possible that children experi-ence larger changes in primals than adults in response toglobal adverse events (e.g., see Poulin & Silver, 2019; Riniet al., 2004)

Perspectives on Psychological Science, 15(6), 1295‚Äì1309. https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691620927709","Our analysis was broad but limited. First, we examined publications from two top-tier journals within each area, although these journals are not representative of all journals. Future research is needed with other journals, both general (e.g., Psychological Science) and area specific (e.g., Journal of Cognition and Development). Second, we focused our analysis on psychology journals, but future research could consider diversity among funding agencies. To truly diversify psychological science, it is important for funding agencies to consist of diverse review panels, to support researchers of color, and to fund projects with diverse samples. Third, our interest was in psychological research that highlighted the important role of race in thinking, development, and behavior, although many of the core issues tackled here extend to other social groups as well, including but not limited to those based on gender, sexual orientation, religion, class, and political orientation (see also Duarte et al., 2015; Petty, Fleming, & Fabrigar, 1999). Notwithstanding these limitations, the present research makes a clear contribution to psychological science. Racial diversity, segregation, and inequality have increased in recent years, particularly in the United States, and this reality has important implications for how people think, develop, and behave. Here, we have documented the extent to which some of the most prestigious journals in psychological science do not reflect this reality but do indeed reflect structural inequality. The few psychology publications that have highlighted race have been edited mostly by White editors who have published fewer articles that highlight race, and they have been written mostly by White authors who have employed fewer participants of color. Simply put, the research, researchers, and researched are all systematically interconnected (Medin et al., 2017). These patterns, of course, vary across decade and area, but overall, they make clear that psychological science has a long way to go if it is to be a truly diverse, equitable, and inclusive enterprise. We advocate for a set of recommendations that takes more seriously the role that racialized experiences have in human psychology, for both White people and POCs, and makes more transparent who regulates, narrates, and participates in psychological science. Finally, the present work is not an indictment of psychological scientists, although it is an indictment of psychological science. Our field has for decades revealed the pitfalls of psychological biases (e.g., explicit and implicit attitudes, motivated cognition, beliefs in a just world) and structural inequality (e.g., racially homogeneous institutions, hierarchy-enhancing policies, color-blind leadership) and how the dynamic interplay between the two maintain and reinforce racial inequality (see Roberts & Rizzo, in press; Salter et al., 2018). Yet we have neglected the fact that our own perspectives confine our view of reality. If we are to have a genuinely sound and equitable science, we must acknowledge the role of our finite perspectives and develop practices that ensure our science is not limited or dominated by a single one. As the world becomes increasingly diverse, it will become necessary for our science to become diverse as well. We hope that this truth becomes self-evident as we progress further into the 21st century.","Race plays an important role in how people think, develop, and behave. In the current article, we queried more than 26,000 empirical articles published between 1974 and 2018 in top-tier cognitive, developmental, and social psychology journals to document how often psychological research acknowledges this reality and to examine whether people who edit, write, and participate in the research are systematically connected. We note several findings. First, across the past five decades, psychological publications that highlight race have been rare, and although they have increased in
developmental and social psychology, they have remained virtually nonexistent in cognitive psychology. Second, most publications have been edited by White editors, under which there have been significantly fewer publications that highlight race. Third, many of the publications that highlight race have been written by White authors who employed significantly fewer participants of color. In many cases, we document variation as a function of area and decade. We argue that systemic inequality exists within psychological research and that systemic changes are needed to ensure that psychological research benefits from diversity in editing, writing, and participation. To this end, and in the spirit of the field‚Äôs recent emphasis on metascience, we offer recommendations for journals and authors","1",0,"1","Political",2,1

American Psychologist, 75(3), 301‚Äì315. https://doi.org/10.1037/amp0000494","Challenging traditional claims that stereotypes of women and men are fixed or rigid, our study joins others in finding stereotypes to be flexibly responsive to changes in group members‚Äô social roles (e.g., Koenig & Eagly, 2014). As the roles of women and men have changed since the mid-20th century, so have consensual beliefs about their attributes. These conclusions derive from national public opinion polls conducted in the United States with over 30,000 adult respondents. Although such polls are limited in number, they are sufficient to demonstrate clear increases in the ascription of communion to women relative to men but a lack of change in agency. Although women also gained in competence relative to men, belief in competence equality has increased over time as well. As demonstrated by Diekman and Eagly‚Äôs (2000) research on dynamic stereotypes, people generally think that gender stereotypes on agency have converged and will continue to do so because of the growing similarity in the employment and domestic commitments of women and men. Contrary to this propositional reasoning, our meta-analysis showed that these socioeconomic changes are associated with stereotypic increases in women‚Äôs communion and competence but not in their agency. The flaw in people‚Äôs reasoning likely flows from their lack of conscious awareness of the extent of sex segregation of the labor force, as demonstrated by Beyer‚Äôs (2018) findings of systematic underestimation of occupational segregation. Thus, women‚Äôs increasing employment has crowded them mainly into jobs emphasizing social skills and social contribution (Cortes & Pan, 2018), often in the expanding service, education, and health care sectors of the economy. Because people have increasingly observed women in such jobs, the associative processes of stereotype formation following from observations of women‚Äôs paid work have more strongly linked them with communion, supplementing observations of women‚Äôs enduring, albeit diminished, domestic specialization (see Gawronski & Bodenhausen, 2006, for discussion of propositional and associative processing). Two other psychological processes may also have fostered women‚Äôs communal stereotype. One is that, whereas women‚Äôs earlier domestic role may have seemed obligatory, people likely believe that women now have substantial choice about the occupations they pursue, thus increasing the strength of their inference to corresponding traits (Jones & Davis, 1965). Yet another process contributing to the escalation of women‚Äôs communion may follow from its being the strongest gender stereotype. Its salience may have fostered its accentuation as it became the most conspicuous quality differentiating women and men (see Eyal & Epley, 2017). Even though women are overrepresented in communal roles, occupational sex segregation did decrease, mainly in the late 20th century (Hegewisch & Hartmann, 2014). This shift drew women into many male-dominated occupations; however, many of these are not particularly agentically demanding (e.g., veterinarian, dentist; Roos & Stevens, 2018). Moreover, even within the more agentic roles that women entered, such as lawyer and manager, internal resegregation tended to put women into the more communal variants of these roles (Levanon & Grusky, 2016). In some instances, new female ghettos emerged through the redesign of jobs to have lower authority and reward social skills (e.g., bank branch manager; Skuratowicz & Hunter, 2004). For all of these reasons, women‚Äôs increasing employment has likely driven the stereotype of women toward gains in communion but not agency even while yielding gains in competence. Our findings reveal gender stereotypes‚Äô remarkable consensuality across respondent sex, education, employment, marital status, race-ethnicity, and generation. Sex of respondent did reveal some ingroup favoritism, with women, relative to men, rating women more favorably (cf. Rudman & Goodwin, 2004). Nevertheless, women and men generally agreed with the overall patterns on communion, agency, and competence, as did the subgroups based on other demographics. For instance, in recent polls, among those noting a sex difference in competence, even male respondents shared the belief that women are the more competent sex. The competence findings challenge the assumption that women, as a lower status social group, are accorded less competence than are men (e.g., Ridgeway, 2014). This assumption neglects women‚Äôs educational attainments and entry into high-prestige occupations (e.g., physician, education administrator), which diminished men‚Äôs once-strong advantage in occupational prestige (Lippa et al., 2014; see also Kleinjans, Krassel, & Dukes, 2017). Occupational prestige may have a greater influence on competence beliefs than do other status indicators (income and hierarchical power), on which women remain more disadvantaged. Interpretations of our findings should consider that social movements organized to lessen group disadvantage usually challenge cultural stereotypes about the group. With feminist activism, gender stereotypes thus tended to become politically incorrect, and belief in gender equality became more correct (Eagly, 2018). To address this potential source of bias, the analysis of equality responses to the poll items found a significant increase only in competence. Moreover, the increase in female advantage in both communion and competence remained intact when controlled for equality responding. A related consideration is that increasing pressures for political correctness may have fostered the ascription of positive traits to women. However, the analysis of traits‚Äô evaluative content did not support this supposition. Another limitation is that our project could not explore stereotypes resulting from sex intersecting with other categories (e.g., stereotypes about women and men differing in race and ethnicity; Ghavami & Peplau, 2013). Yet, given that people‚Äôs observations should be somewhat weighted toward their own social group, decomposition of the poll data by respondents‚Äô demographic groups yielded findings suggestive of intersectionality (e.g., Whites, more than Blacks, found agency more true of men than women). Measurement limitations included the categorical form of the items (i.e., more true of women or men, or equal), which did not allow expression of the magnitude of perceived sex differences. Yet, Lueptow et al.‚Äôs (2001) report of trends from 1974 to 1997, based on respondents‚Äô separate ratings of men and women on 7-point scales, revealed findings very similar to those in our data: an increase in the communion of women relative to men and little change in agency. Another limitation is that the polls did not include implicit measures of stereotypes, thus limiting understanding of whether change over time might differ between the two types of measures (Lemm & Banaji, 1999; Rudman & Goodwin, 2004).
","This meta-analysis integrated 16 nationally representative U.S. public opinion polls on gender stereotypes (N 30,093 adults), extending from 1946 to 2018, a span of seven decades that brought considerable change in gender relations, especially in women‚Äôs roles. In polls inquiring about communion (e.g., affectionate, emotional), agency (e.g., ambitious, courageous), and competence (e.g., intelligent, creative), respondents indicated whether each trait is more true of women or men, or equally true of both. Women‚Äôs relative advantage in communion increased over time, but men‚Äôs relative advantage in agency showed no change. Belief in competence equality increased over time, along with belief in female superiority among those who indicated a sex difference in competence. Contemporary gender stereotypes thus convey substantial female advantage in communion and a smaller male advantage in agency but also gender equality in competence along with some female advantage. Interpretation emphasizes the origins of gender stereotypes in the social roles of women and men.","3",0,"3","Political",3,0

Violent crime has a high loading on the first factor, as do HIV/AIDS, infant mortality, life expectancy, income, and skin color (% Black). The more biological variables such as skin color yielded the highest correlations with violent crime, while income, a social variable, provided the lowest. We suggest this pattern of results is accounted for by evolutionary life history theory in which there is covariation between reproductive effort, aggressiveness, high fertility, low altruism, and poor social organization.

One criticism of our study is that the estimate of IQ is from McDaniel (2006) and is based on reading and mathematics scores from the NAEP. One reviewer argued there was no evidence that education tests measured g. In fact, however, a large body of evidence shows that they do (Jensen, 1998). Also, for example, Frey and Detterman (2004) showed that educational tests such as the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) are ‚Äúmainly a test of g‚Äù (p. 273). Another criticism is that the statistics we used are problematic given the skews in the data (Hassall & Sherratt, under revision). We dealt with this by also carrying out non-parametric analyses and found similar results. We also note that procedures are standard in this research field as used by other researchers.

The present study supports Templer and Arikawa's (2006) finding that skin color is a human life history variable. In The Global Bell Curve, Lynn (2008) showed that in many countries around the world, skin color is the basis of social stratification. In the US there is a racial hierarchy in which Europeans have the highest IQ and earnings and socio-economic status, Hispanics come next, while Blacks do least well. Lynn found similar racial hierarchies in Europe, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Color-stratified societies are sometimes referred to as ‚Äúpigmentocracies‚Äù by anthropologists and sociologists and are explained mainly by the structural consequences of colonialism, discrimination, and prejudice. Lynn (2008), however, attributes their cause to heritable IQ and the cold winter hypothesis that shaped the relation between IQ and skin color.

The IQ/skin color link may be more profoundly connected with evolutionary life history theory than previously considered. Ducrest et al. (2008) showed that darker individuals in 20 wild vertebrate species including fish, reptiles, birds, amphibia, and mammals are more aggressive, sexually active, and resistant to stress than lighter individuals. They also show larger body mass and greater energy and physical activity such as grooming, pigmentation of the hair, skin, cuticle, feather, and eye were related to the adaptive function of melanin-based coloration mediated through higher production of sexual steroids including testosterone. Melanin-based coloration, therefore, may be part of the fast (r-strategy) end of the r‚ÄìK life history continuum, which is associated with disruptive as opposed to the socially cohesive behavior of the slow life history (K-strategy).

Wicherts, Borsboom, and Dolan (2010b) critiqued our evolutionary explanation of national IQ differences by pointing to many possible confounds between the measures and the often poor quality of the data, especially from sub-Saharan Africa. They argued these problems rendered empirical tests of long-ago events virtually impossible and concluded an evolutionary basis for national IQs should only be inferred if ‚Äúvery strong prior knowledge of the processes that created the dependencies‚Äù existed, and such knowledge is ‚Äúall but lacking.‚Äù Nonetheless, when Wicherts et al. (2010b) carried out an analysis of their own across 60 selected countries after excluding low-scoring sub-Saharan African countries, they too found national IQs showed correlations with latitude (0.50), fertility (‚àí0.75), child mortality (‚àí0.61), education (0.60), calories per day (0.44), and urbanization (0.52). They also found one dominant principal component explained 65% of the variance across 18 variables. However, Wicherts et al. (2010b) argued that a more plausible (and proximal) explanation for the co-variation was a country's ‚Äúdevelopmental status.‚Äù

Lynn (2010a), Rushton (2010), and Templer (2010) responded to Wicherts et al. (2010b), who in turn replied to them (Wicherts, Borsboom, & Dolan, 2010a). For example, Rushton (2010) showed that heritable brain-power played a decisive role in Lynn's g nexus. A biological variable such as brain size can break circular reasoning among social‚Äìcultural variables. Studies of brain size, including those using MRI, show a correlation of 0.40 with IQ. Substantial population differences exist in brain size that parallel the IQ differences. In average cranial capacity (cm¬≥), East Asians=1364; Whites=1347; and Blacks=1267. Since every cubic centimeter of brain tissue contains millions of brain cells and billions of synapses, the race differences in brain size help to explain the race differences in IQ. From the brain size data given above on the three populations, Jensen (1998, p. 443) calculated a correlation of 0.998 between their mean IQ and their mean cranial capacity.

Rushton (2010) calculated correlations between brain size and IQ for the 10 ‚Äúgenetic clusters‚Äù identified by Cavalli-Sforza et al. (1994) into which Lynn (2006) had grouped his national IQs in order to show the national scores depended on the racial composition of the country. Across the 10 groupings, Rushton (2010) calculated a 0.91 correlation between the racial IQ scores given by Lynn, and the cranial capacities given in a collation of 20,000 skulls gathered from around the world by Beals et al. (1984, p. 304, Fig. 3). Rushton (2010) also calculated a 0.83 correlation between cranial capacity and IQ from another data set across the 10 populations provided by Lynn (2006, p. 212, Table 16.2). Any variable such as brain size that explains differences at the non-human level as well as at the level of the individual, nation, and international level, deserves to be taken very seriously (see Rushton & Ankney, 2009, for details on brain size).","In 50 U.S. states, we found a positive manifold across 11 measures including IQ, skin color, birth rate, infant mortality, life expectancy, HIV/AIDS, violent crime, and state income with the first principal component accounting for 33% of the variance (median factor loading= .34). The correlation with a composite of total violent crime was higher with skin color (r= .55), a more biologically influenced variable than with GDP (r=‚àí.17), a more culturally influenced variable. These results corroborate and extend those found at the international level using INTERPOL crime statistics and at the county, provincial, and state levels within countries using local statistics. We interpret the cross-cultural consistency from an evolutionary life history perspective in which hierarchically organized traits culminate in a single, heritable, superfactor. Traits need to be genetically organized to meet the trials of life‚Äîsurvival, growth, and reproduction. We discuss brain size and the g nexus as central to understand individual and group differences and we highlight melanin and skin color as a potentially important new
life history variable.","7",0,"7","Political",6,1

Psychological Science, 14(6), 623‚Äì628. https://doi.org/10.1046/j.0956-7976.2003.psci_1475.x","These findings suggest that a model in which variability in intelligence among children is partitioned into independent components attributable to genes and environments is too simple for the dynamic interaction of genes and real-world environments during development. The relative importance of environmental differences in causing differences in observed intelligence appears to vary with the SES of the homes in which children were raised. SES is a complex variable, however, and the substantive interpretation to be placed on our results depends on an interpretation of what SES actually measures.

The most obvious interpretation of SES in this study is that it measured the quality of the environment in which the children were born and raised. Indeed, this is the function for which SES was intended. Under this interpretation, the observed interaction between SES and the biometric components of IQ could be indicative of precisely the kind of nonlinear relationship between rearing environment and intelligence that has been suggested by Scarr (1981) and Jensen (1981), with differences among poor environments contributing more to differences in phenotypic outcome than differences among middle-class or better environments contribute.

It would be naive, however, to interpret SES strictly as an environmental variable. Most variables traditionally thought of as markers of environmental quality also reflect genetic variability (Plomin & Bergeman, 1991). Children reared in low-SES households, therefore, may differ from more affluent children both environmentally and genetically (Gottesman, 1968), and the models we employed in this study do not allow us to determine which aspect of SES is responsible for the interactions we observed. Indeed, it will be difficult to separate the genetic and environmental aspects of SES or other measures of the family environment in research designs of this kind, because children raised in the same home necessarily have the same SES.

Genetic variability in SES might also introduce a complication to the models themselves. Phenotypic SES and IQ are correlated, and that correlation is potentially mediated both genetically and environmentally. Therefore, the models are attempting to detect an interaction between genotype and environment in the presence of a correlation between genotype and environment, raising the concern that the presence of the correlation might introduce bias into the estimation of the interaction. However, Purcell (2003) has conducted an exhaustive series of simulations that suggest no bias is introduced, as long as the main effect of the moderating variable is included in the model, as we have done here. The presence in the model of the main effect of SES means that the biometric model fitting is actually being conducted on the portion of IQ that is independent of both the genetic and environmental components of SES. (We note, however, that omitting the main effect from the model did not change the results to a significant degree.)

The developmental mechanisms underlying the effect remain unclear. Although the models indicate that the A, C, and E interactions jointly contributed significant variance to differences in FSIQ and PIQ, the models were less able to distinguish which of the individual interactions with A, C, and E was most important in the effect. The interaction could be mediated primarily along genetic pathways, meaning that genetic differences among individuals are accentuated in favorable environments, as has been theorized by Bronfenbrenner (Bronfenbrenner & Ceci, 1994). It could also be that the slope of the IQ-Environment function is steeper at low levels of environment, as suggested by Scarr (1981) and Jensen (1981). Or maybe outcome simply becomes less predictable in poor environments, leading to an increase in E variability, as we have suggested (Turkheimer & Waldron, 2000) based on other evidence. To resolve this issue, it will be most important to study large samples, which will provide greater power to discriminate differences among the genetic and environmental interactions.

It should also be noted that we found the interaction for FSIQ and PIQ only; the interaction was in the predicted direction for VIQ but did not approach statistical significance. Specifying more precisely the kinds of abilities for which the interaction is likely to occur is the current focus of investigation in our laboratory. In the National Collaborative Perinatal Project, scores are available for the individual subtests of the WISC, and for a variety of other ability and achievement measures. We are developing models of interactions between SES and genetic and environmental variance in multivariate analyses of factor scores based on correlations among individual tests.

In the fractious history of scientific investigations of the heritability of intelligence, the effects of poverty, and the relations between them, there has been only one contention with which everyone could agree: Additive models of linear and independent contributions of genes and environment to variation in intelligence cannot do justice to the complexity of the development of intelligence in children. Only recently have statistical models and computational capacity advanced to the point that less simplistic models can actually be fit. Although there is much that remains to be understood, our study and the ones that have preceded it have begun to converge on the hypothesis that the developmental forces at work in poor environments are qualitatively different from those at work in adequate ones. Clarification of the nature of these differences promises to be a fascinating, and hopefully unifying, subject for future investigation.
","Scores on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children were analyzed in a sample of 7-year-old twins from the National Collaborative Perinatal Project. A substantial proportion of the twins were raised in families living near or below the poverty level. Biometric analyses were conducted using models allowing for components attributable to the additive effects of genotype, shared environment, and nonshared environment to interact with socioeconomic status (SES) measured as a continuous variable. Results demonstrate that the proportions of IQ variance attributable to genes and environment vary nonlinearly with SES. The models suggest that in impoverished families, 60% of the variance in IQ is accounted for by the shared environment, and the contribution of genes is close to zero; in affluent families, the result is almost exactly the reverse.","2",0,"2","Political",4,1

Across 12 studies spanning over 8,000 participants in the U.S. and over 66,000 participants worldwide, our data consistently reveal the answer is yes. These data reveal that (1) both liberal and conservative American participants identify a large number of left-wing authoritarians in their everyday lives (Study 1), and (2) both liberal and conservative participants rate a common Left-Wing Authoritarianism scale as measuring authoritarianism (Study 2). Further, this same LWA scale (3) consistently predicts key phenomena that major authoritarianism theories suggest it should predict, including (3a) threat sensitivity (Studies 3‚Äì6), (3b) restrictive communication norms (Study 7), (3c) negative ratings of minority groups (Studies 8‚Äì10), and (3d) dogmatism (Studies 10 and 11). Further, we used multiple methods to help overcome the double-barreled measurement problem inherent in any authoritarianism measurement, including controlling directly for ideology (Studies 3‚Äì11) and performing analyses only on liberals (Studies 3‚Äì11). Finally, we (4) found evidence of left-wing authoritarianism in an expansive world-wide sample (Study 12). Each of these approaches has offsetting strengths and weaknesses, and yet they all point to the same conclusion: This wide array of triangulating evidence provides consistent support for the idea that left-wing authoritarianism is indeed a widespread everyday reality.

Below, we place this array of evidence into the existing literature on authoritarianism and ideology, discuss limitations of our work, and offer a brief set of concluding thoughts.

8.1. The authoritarianism debate
The present studies have multiple implications for the ongoing debate about the nature of authoritarianism. Nilsson and Jost (2020) have argued that prior evidence based on Conway et al.‚Äôs (2018) LWA scale was due to its overlap with liberal ideology, and thus it did not provide empirical evidence of liberal authoritarianism. The issue raised by this critique is important. What do more focused empirical tests ‚Äì tests based in long-accepted scientific practice ‚Äì reveal? Our multi-method evidence here suggests that, in fact, the scale is measuring something beyond mere liberalism. Almost all key effects across Studies 3‚Äì11 remain when controlling for political ideology. Further, in a similar fashion, almost all key effects remain within-liberals: Thus, when comparing liberal authoritarians to liberal non-authoritarians, high-LWA persons show conceptually-expected correlations. As a result, the scale differentiates one kind of liberal from another kind, and thus cannot be reduced to mere ideology.

This array of evidence overwhelmingly suggests that, contrary to critics‚Äô claims, there is something beyond mere ideology captured by the LWA scale. What is that something beyond? Consistent with a long line of research on RWA, by far the most parsimonious answer to that question is that the something beyond is authoritarianism. And indeed, using standard content validity approaches also used in other authoritarianism work (e.g., Funke, 2005; Dunwoody and Funke, 2016), Study 2 showed that participants evaluate the items in Conway‚Äôs LWA scale as measurements of authoritarianism. This strong empirical evidence is echoed in the judgments of researchers Fasce and Avenda√±o (2020, p. 3), who commented that the items on Conway et al.‚Äôs LWA scale ‚Äúare not merely statements of liberal ideology; they univocally reflect an extremely authoritarian attitude, opposed to liberal commitments such as equality among citizens, freedom of expression, and tolerance toward political and cultural diversity.‚Äù

Taken together, this array of triangulating evidence points to the conclusion that ‚Äì as is the case for the scientific consensus on the Altemeyer RWA scale on which it was based ‚Äì Conway et al.‚Äôs LWA scale is a valid measurement of authoritarianism.

8.2. Limitations
Like all studies, the present study has limitations. First, although employing much larger and more diverse samples than most previous work on authoritarianism, Studies 1‚Äì11 (like much prior authoritarianism research) are nonetheless limited to the United States and should not be taken to generalize beyond that region.

Further, as other researchers have noted (Nilsson and Jost, 2020), the Conway et al. (2018) scale on which Studies 2‚Äì11 are based is not perfect. However, essentially all critiques of individual items on the scale hinge on the argument that these items do not measure anything beyond left-wing ideology.12 As such, all these smaller critiques are best addressed with triangulating empirical evidence that the whole collection of items ‚Äì used in the way originally intended by the authors of the scale, as a total summative measure ‚Äì is in fact capturing something beyond mere ideology. Evidence that the whole scale is valid suggests at a minimum that the collection of items as a whole is valid ‚Äì and thus directly suggests there is no systemic problem with items interfering with the validity of the scale. It is just that kind of whole-scale validity evidence that has been supplied across multiple studies in the present package. This empirical approach mirrors the approach in other domains when critiques arise of the empirical validity of particular theoretical constructs (e.g., Banaji et al., 2004).

However, we acknowledge that Conway et al.‚Äôs (2018) LWA scale, like all scales, is not perfect and thus does of course have room for improvement (Conway, 2020). But saying a scale is imperfect is not the same as saying a scale is invalid. All measurements contain imperfections and all studies contain messiness, and yet that should not deter us from bigger-picture research conclusions (Cooper, 2016). Thus, we acknowledge the facts that (a) like virtually every scale, the LWA scale could be improved, and (b) as a scale designed to parallel the most widely-used RWA scale, it inherited some of that scale‚Äôs weaknesses. However, this lack of perfection should not be confused with the larger, big-picture issue of the degree that it can be construed as a valid measurement of left-wing authoritarianism. The overwhelming amount of evidence across multiple studies speaks clearly: It can be accurately viewed as a measurement of left-wing authoritarianism.

8.3. Concluding thoughts
Recent evidence has revealed a need for balanced evaluations of potential symmetries and asymmetries related to political ideology (e.g., Duarte et al., 2015; Jussim et al., 2015, 2016; Crawford, 2017; Frimer et al., 2017; Proch et al., 2018; Ditto et al., 2019; Eadeh and Chang, 2019; Fiagbenu et al., 2019; Clark and Winegard, 2020; Honeycutt and Jussim, 2020). Using a multi-method approach spanning multiple content areas, validity types, statistical controls, and scale types, the present results consistently show that, just as right-wing persons are sometimes authoritarian, left-wing persons may also be similarly authoritarian. Taken together, this large array of evidence suggests that left-wing authoritarianism is more of a reality than a myth.","Is left-wing authoritarianism (LWA) closer to a myth or a reality? Twelve studies test the empirical existence and theoretical relevance of LWA. Study 1 reveals that both conservative and liberal Americans identify a large number of left-wing authoritarians in their lives. In Study 2, participants explicitly rate items from a recently-developed LWA measure as valid measurements of authoritarianism. Studies 3‚Äì11 show that persons who score high on this same LWA scale possess the traits associated with models of authoritarianism: LWA is positively related to threat sensitivity across multiple areas, including general ecological threats (Study 3), COVID disease threat (Study 4), Belief in a Dangerous World (Study 5), and Trump threat (Study 6). Further, high-LWA persons show more support for restrictive political correctness norms (Study 7), rate African-Americans and Jews more negatively (Studies 8‚Äì9), and show more cognitive rigidity (Studies 10 and 11). These effects hold when controlling for political ideology and when looking only within liberals, and further are similar in magnitude to comparable effects for right-wing authoritarianism. Study 12 uses the World Values Survey to provide cross-cultural evidence of Left-Wing Authoritarianism around the globe. Taken in total, this large array of triangulating evidence from 12 studies comprised of over 8,000 participants from the U.S. and over 66,000 participants world-wide strongly suggests that left-wing authoritarianism is much closer to a reality than a myth.","5",0,"5","Political",5,1

PLoS One, 8(1), e52595. https:// doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052595","Theories of attentional selection, such as salience and visual search theories [10], [18]-[21], assume attention to be automatically attracted by the most salient location. An additional assumption of these theories is noise operating during the computation process. This assumption of noise requires the distinction between stimulus salience, determined by physical stimulus properties, and the salience estimate for selection which is susceptible to noise - selection salience. Although there are empirical studies providing evidence for attentional capture by the most salient stimulus [11], [12], [14], there has been no previous study in which salience of a target and salience of a distractor were varied parametrically, to demonstrate that noise influences the process of selection between two competing locations and turns salience into a stochastic variable such that even less salient stimuli lead to RT interference because they may be selected prior to the most salient ones. Note that the assumption of noise influencing the selection process is also at the heart of the redundant-signals paradigm. Here, two salient features share the same location while racing for selection [60], [61].

The aim of the present study was to test the predictions by visual search and salience models that noise influences the selection process such that (i) selection salience (based on which a selection is made) varies as a function of relative salience between target and distractor and (ii) distractors less stimulus-salient than the target capture attention. Further, by implementing the distinction between stimulus and selection salience computationally, we aimed at modelling the empirical results of the distractor visual search experiment.

By manipulating stimulus salience of targets and distractors parametrically, we found distractor interference to be sigmoidally related to salience difference between targets and distractors and even distractors less salient than the target to interfere with search and capture attention. These results are in accordance with salience [18]-[20] and visual search models [8], [10], [21], which assume noise during the selection process. This, at the same time, suggests that experimental manipulations of previous studies [11], [12], [14], [16] were insufficient to recognize the stochastic dependency between salience and attentional capture and hence claimed that the most (stimulus-) salient item is invariably selected first. Parametric salience manipulation, by contrast, revealed a gradual increase of RT interference with increasing distractor salience relative to the target, where a less salient distractor can be selected before the more salient target. These results point to a stochastic relationship between stimulus salience and selection, which is predicted by visual search and salience models, but was not shown in relevant empirical studies.","Current accounts of attentional capture predict the most salient stimulus to be invariably selected first. However, existing salience and visual search models assume noise in the map computation or selection process. Consequently, they predict the first selection to be stochastically dependent on salience, implying that attention could even be captured first by the second most salient (instead of the most salient) stimulus in the field. Yet, capture by less salient distractors has not been reported and salience-based selection accounts claim that the distractor has to be more salient in order to capture attention. We tested this prediction using an empirical and modeling approach of the visual search distractor paradigm. For the empirical part, we manipulated salience of target and distractor parametrically and measured reaction time interference when a distractor was present compared to absent. Reaction time interference was strongly correlated with distractor salience relative to the target. Moreover, even distractors less salient than the target captured attention, as measured by reaction time interference and oculomotor capture. In the modeling part, we simulated first selection in the distractor paradigm using behavioral measures of salience and considering the time course of selection including noise. We were able to replicate the result pattern we obtained in the empirical part. We conclude that each salience value follows a specific selection time distribution and attentional capture occurs when the selection time distributions of target and distractor overlap. Hence, selection is stochastic in nature and attentional capture occurs with a certain probability depending on relative salience.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,0

Although many investigators study ‚ÄúIQ‚Äù or ‚Äúg‚Äù as an
operational definition of intelligence, these operationalizations are at best incomplete, even according to those who
accept the constructs as useful (e.g., Carroll, 1993). Research suggests that properties of intelligence beyond g
may be somewhat different from those of g (e.g., Gardner,
1983; Sternberg et al., 2000, 2001). Race is a social construction, not a biological construct, and studies currently
indicating alleged genetic bases of racial differences in
intelligence fail to make their point even for these socialdefined groups. In general, we need to be careful, in psychological research, to distinguish our folk conceptions of
constructs from the constructs themselves.","In this article, the authors argue that the overwhelming portion of the literature on intelligence, race, and genetics is based on folk taxonomies rather than scientific analysis. They suggest that because theorists of intelligence disagree as to what it is, any consideration of its relationships to other constructs must be tentative at best. They further argue that race is a social construction with no scientific definition. Thus, studies of the relationship between race and other constructs may serve social ends but cannot serve scientific ends. No gene has yet been conclusively linked to intelligence, so attempts to provide a compelling genetic link of race to intelligence are not feasible at this time. The authors also show that heritability, a behavior-genetic concept, is inadequate in regard to providing such a link.","6",1,"2","Political",2,1

Research on this topic has been done and the results are widely available. Major psychology journals continue to publish work that deals openly with group differences (though researchers still debate about the relative contribution of genes and environment, and the question has not been settled definitively). Any measures that would be effective in preventing further work, such as those advocated by Kourany (Citation2016), would have to be so severe that they would only attract even more attention to the findings they aimed to suppress. Science will carry on, and these questions will be answered. We should prepare in advance for the possibility that the genes underlying intelligence differences will not be distributed identically among ethnic groups. Failure to do this will only create a vacuum for ‚Äúcranks rather than scientists‚Äù to opine on the nature and consequences of group differences (Anomaly, Citation2017, p. 293). Reich (Citation2018) warns that if scientists ‚Äúwillfully abstain from laying out a rational framework for discussing human differences, [they] will leave a vacuum that will be filled by pseudoscience‚Äù (p. 258).

This paper has argued that the usual utilitarian reasons given for restricting intelligence research are not convincing and, in fact, there are strong reasons, both utilitarian and non-utilitarian, to favor free inquiry. For philosophers specifically, there is an additional consideration. For decades, the contribution of philosophers to this debate has consisted mostly in providing alternative explanations for evidence seeming to support hereditarianism about race differences (see Sesardic, Citation2000, Citation2005), and advocating various kinds of restriction and censorship (see Cofnas, Citation2016). This may be because hereditarianism is controversial, and philosophers are strongly disincentivized from pursuing lines of argument that lead to truly controversial conclusions. Testifying to how serious this problem is, Jeff McMahan, Francesca Minerva, and Peter Singer recently founded the Journal of Controversial Ideas, which will allow scholars to publish pseudonymously. Singer (Citation2017) commented that ‚Äúit‚Äôs unfortunate that such a journal should ever be considered necessary to enable controversial ideas to be published, but perhaps we have got to the point where it is.‚Äù It is not clear what kind of controversial ideas Singer had in mind, and the journal has not yet released its first issue, but it is hard to find a more controversial idea than hereditarianism about race differences in intelligence.

There is a danger for the philosophical community in putting our credibility on the line over the claim that race differences are entirely environmental. If work on genetics and neuroscience within the next decade produces convincing evidence that differences in measured intelligence among groups have a significant genetic component, there will be no way to conceal this information. The hereditarian explanation will have to be accepted, and people will know that philosophers were on the wrong side of the issue both scientifically and morally: scientifically, because we are supposed to be careful, disinterested commentators on scientific controversies, not activists supporting only the politically popular side; morally, because we did not help lay the groundwork for responding in a moral way to these facts that we should have known might be coming.","In a very short time, it is likely that we will identify many of the genetic variants underlying individual differences in intelligence. We should be prepared for the possibility that these variants are not distributed identically among all geographic populations, and that this explains some of the phenotypic differences in measured intelligence among groups. However, some philosophers and scientists believe that we should refrain from conducting research that might demonstrate the (partly) genetic origin of group differences in IQ. Many scholars view academic interest in this topic as inherently morally suspect or even racist. The majority of philosophers and social scientists take it for granted that all population differences in intelligence are due to environmental factors. The present paper argues that the widespread practice of ignoring or rejecting research on intelligence differences can have unintended negative consequences. Social policies predicated on environmentalist theories of group differences may fail to achieve their aims.

European Psychologist, 18, 286-294. http:// dx.doi.org/10.1027/1016-9040/a000144","In our current era of bibliometric ratings and rankings, any potential publisher will of course be concerned with the question whether such a journal could compete with others in the field with respect to impact factors and other indices of success (may they be questionable or not, see e.g., Mayor, 2010). There are some reasons (Walster & Cleary, 1970) to dream of an ideal world in which all journals would start simultaneously with the publishing policy outlined above. However, this cannot be expected (Crandall, 1990), and we certainly do not propose a paternalistic regulation of the field. Therefore it is likely that authors would decide to withdraw their manuscripts and publish them in established outlets if their results turn out to be statistically significant, leaving only the nonsignificant outcomes for the JPPR.

Would this journal thus still be an interesting option for a potential publisher, either profit or nonprofit oriented? We believe that an initial bias in favor of statistically nonsignificant results would not at all hamper the success of the proposed journal. Given a rigorous quality management in the editorial process, the journal would publish only high-quality nonsignificant results of potentially high information value (e.g., studies with sufficient power). Any serious review or meta-analysis article on a specific topic would certainly have to include these papers. In addition, any serious research article on a specific topic should not be able to omit relevant JPPR articles from their introduction or discussion sections. We are thus optimistic that the reviewers of other journals ‚Äì who will probably also have published in the JPPR ‚Äì would encourage or require the consideration of these papers in balanced introductions and discussions of research articles. Hence, from a publisher‚Äôs point of view, the journal would almost certainly become a frequently cited outlet. This, in turn, would increase its attractiveness for submitters.

From the point of view of individual scientists, the journal would also be attractive, primarily because it would reduce the scientific high-risk gamble to a more calculable transparent endeavor: Publication success is then determined by theoretical soundness and experimental rigor, but not by the accidental willingness of the universe to corroborate our ideas.

From the point of view of scientific progress in general, such an editorial policy would certainly lead to a more balanced evaluation of empirical evidence and thus contribute to cumulative knowledge. Furthermore, we dare to predict that pre-reviewing research would generally increase the quality of experimental designs in psychology, leading to the acceptance of study proposals that promise sufficient power and meaningful results, irrespective of the actual outcome. With pre-reviewed research reports, scientists would likely invest more energy into developing truly efficient designs and even more innovative research questions rather than being compelled to invest in sure-bet significant outcomes. In sum, a pre-review editorial policy would probably become a win-win-win endeavor from the science‚Äôs, the scientists‚Äô, and the publisher‚Äôs points of view.
","The present article suggests a possible way to reduce the file drawer problem in scientific research (Rosenthal, 1978, 1979), that is, the tendency for ‚Äúnonsignificant‚Äù results to remain hidden in scientists‚Äô file drawers because both authors and journals strongly prefer statistically significant results. We argue that peer-reviewed journals based on the principle of rigorous evaluation of research proposals before results are known would address this problem successfully. Even a single journal adopting a result-blind evaluation policy would remedy the persisting problem of publication bias more efficiently than other tools and techniques suggested so far. We also propose an ideal editorial policy for such a journal and discuss pragmatic implications and potential problems associated with this policy. Moreover, we argue that such a journal would be a valuable addition to the scientific publication outlets, because it supports a scientific culture encouraging the publication of well-designed and technically sound empirical research irrespective of the results obtained. Finally, we argue that such a journal would be attractive for scientists, publishers, and research agencies.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,1

The influence of social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism on environmentalism: A five-year cross-lagged analysis. Plos one, 14(7), e0219067.","We assessed how SDO, RWA, and environmentalism are related over time in a general population sample. Consistent with our predictions and the majority of cross-sectional research, across five years SDO was the stronger ideological predictor of environmentalism, while RWA exhibited a weaker cross-time association. However, environmentalism also significantly related to changes in ideology over time, and while there was no difference in the strength of the path from RWA to environmentalism and the reverse, contrary to our hypothesis, we found that environmentalism is more strongly related to changes in SDO than the reverse. These results suggest that there is a more likely potential causal pathway from environmentalism to ideological attitudes than the opposite direction. We elaborate on each main finding in the next sections.

Environmental attitudes predict ideological attitudes over time

We show that environmentalism predicts ideology over time. This replicates earlier findings by Stanley et al., [25] who showed that the two dimensions of SDO, anti-egalitarianism and dominance, differentially predicted environmentalism cross-sectionally, while longitudinally it is environmental attitudes that predict the components of SDO over time (and not vice versa). This led to the conclusion that we ought to be agnostic about whether ideology precedes environmental attitudes, or the other way around, as further research was needed (see Stanley et al. for a full discussion).

While there is little research on the temporal order and inter-relationships of SDO, RWA and environmentalism specifically, in the sphere of intergroup relations Duckitt's [3] dual-process model predicts a pathway where ultimately SDO and RWA are causes of prejudiced attitudes. Our study contributes to the literature by demonstrating that both directions are significant, and hence that ideological attitudes and environmental attitudes act on each other over time, though interestingly, environmentalism acts on SDO more strongly than the reverse.

The refusal to make personal sacrifices for the environment might lead individuals towards preferring an unequal society. Inaction on climate change means accepting its consequences and allowing these to fall to low status groups. While climate change is arguably the biggest environmental problem of our time, people tend to view themselves and those close to them as less vulnerable to its effects. This is because people are inclined to view climate change as psychologically distant, with themselves and people like themselves more immune to the effects, which are imagined as instead affecting distant social groups, locations, generations, or being uncertain [34-35].

There is some truth to these perceptions: Although humans are causing the rapid heating of the planet, the key contributors to climate change and those most vulnerable to its effects are not necessarily the same people. The IPCC [36] note that hazards associated with climate change are likely to exacerbate stressors and consequently effect people's livelihoods, but these effects are not unilateral. Instead, the poor will be most affected, and they are also the least able to afford to adapt to the effects of climate change. Those in developing countries with low incomes are also most likely to experience negative consequences of climate change on their health. As well as those in poorer nations being most vulnerable to climate change overall, disadvantaged groups within these and other countries tend to be most at risk, thus prompting the IPCC [36] to warn that climate change might increase social inequality.

The issue of climate change therefore fits within the wider discussion about environmental justice [7,8,37-40]. Bryant [41] noted that environmental racism occurs when people of colour are disproportionately exposed to environmental hazards, and receive less protection from these hazards, than more privileged groups. Pellow [42] takes this idea a step further in defining environmental inequality as more strongly tied to social hierarchy, and the burdening of low-status social groups with environmental hazards (broadly defined). Indeed, individuals in subjugated groups tend to be exposed to more hazards in their jobs, and live in areas closer to landfills, pollution, and other environmental hazards. Pellow argues that this inequality occurs when competition for resources ultimately results in dominant groups gaining disproportionate access to these resources, and low-status or minority groups having to instead face the consequences of environmental degradation.

Despite this state of affairs being unfair, some individuals prefer it this way. Specifically, individuals who endorse social dominance orientation are accepting and even prefer social inequality and hierarchical intergroup relations [1]. They believe that high-status social groups are at the top of the hierarchy because they are better than other, subjugated groups. As such, they believe they deserve to disproportionately benefit from environmental exploitation and avoid environmental hazards, while disregarding the effect this has on lower-status social groups. Indeed, Social Dominants are accepting of environmental degradation when the benefits go to high-status social groups, and when given the choice prefer to direct environmental hazards into areas occupied by members of low-status groups [5-6].

With our findings of a temporal connection between environmentalism and SDO, this clarifies the potentially causal nature of this association by suggesting that environmental attitudes precede-and are perhaps foundational for-hierarchical attitudes. It is possible that rejecting environmental action, when doing so is likely to exacerbate problems for low status groups, evokes feelings of cognitive dissonance. These are resolved through accepting social hierarchy and inequality as legitimate and fair (i.e., holding a social dominance orientation). Therefore, individuals who tolerate the environmental inequality brought on by the current environmental crisis, by way of forgoing making personal sacrifices to mitigate the problem, are more likely to extend these attitudes to general tolerance for social inequality.

Jylh√§ and colleagues [7,8,40] advanced the idea that individuals who endorse SDO are more likely to reject the reality of climate change as they are also more tolerant of the inherent inequity in both the causes and consequences of climate change. Denial may therefore serve as a way of maintaining or enhancing the status difference between social groups [8,10]. Our research runs parallel to this interpretation, by suggesting that SDO may serve as a way of protecting the individual from discomfort brought about by the social consequences of inaction on climate change. Sidanius and Pratto's [1] theory of social dominance states that in each society, a hierarchy exists where membership in a high-status group comes with more privileges than membership in a low-status group. Those endorsing SDO are more accepting of ideologies such as racism and sexism, which act to strengthen the hierarchy, and oppose multiculturalism and feminist beliefs, which attenuate group-based dominance. Jost and Hunyady [43] noted that inaction on intergroup inequality by low-status group members likely elicits dissonance, and this is alleviated by accepting the social system as legitimate. Gaining similar opposition from Social Dominants, environmentalism is a hierarchy-attenuating ideology: Exploitation of natural resources favours the dominant group, while the consequences fall to those at the bottom of the hierarchy. Whether directed towards other humans, animals, or humans through the use of the environment, prejudice ultimately reveals Social Dominant's motivation for power in what they perceive as a competitive world [3,44], or perhaps reliance on this conservative political ideology in response to the threat of change [45].

An alternative explanation for this temporal association is based on the measure of environmentalism we use in this study: willingness to make sacrifices for the environment. Duckitt's [3,24] work suggests holding an SDO stems from the belief that individuals must compete for resources. Reluctance to reduce one's own access to resources (through making sacrifices for the environment) is consistent with a competitive worldview, hence potentially explaining why endorsement of this variable precedes changes in SDO. More research is needed to further explore the potential mechanisms underlying the association.

Ideological attitudes predict environmental attitudes over time

Our pattern of results revealed a set of bidirectional ideology-environmentalism associations. Furthermore, of the two ideological predictors included in this study, SDO is a stronger predictor of changes in environmentalism over time than RWA. This is the reverse of the pattern obtained from the first longitudinal analysis on this topic, which showed that RWA was the stronger predictor among students [15]. However, this difference in findings is consistent with expectations based on the results of Stanley and Wilson's [23] meta-analysis, which showed that the association with SDO is significantly weaker in student samples. It is likely that the difference in sample type therefore accounts for the differences in our results, as we used a general population sample. In this context, both SDO and RWA are related to environmentalism, but SDO is a significantly stronger prospective predictor than RWA.

For those in the general population, it is their beliefs about how social groups should be organized that inform their environmental attitudes to a greater degree than their attitudes about authority. However, the bidirectionality of our findings means they warrant exploration of alternative explanations for what drives the associations. For instance, the relationship between ideology and environmentalism across time could be explained by a third variable. Specifically, it is possible that something related both to ideological and environmental attitudes could drive changes in each variable independently, hence explaining the apparent causal relations. For instance, economic factors are related to intergroup attitudes, with some evidence that resource scarcity and economic recession increases intergroup conflict and discrimination [46-47]. These situational factors could also reasonably motivate self-serving behaviours, such as forgoing making personal sacrifices for the environment. Future research could test these and other alternative explanations by examining whether the ideology-environmentalism link is explained by perceptions of resource scarcity or economic downturn.

Our findings also warrant caution for researchers wanting to increase pro-environmentalism: targeting endorsers of SDO with climate change communications might be futile. Specifically, if endorsement of SDO does little to influence later levels of environmentalism (at least, less than the reverse direction), it is unclear whether and how interventions might succeed in spurring high-SDOs to action. In one recent study, Zhao and colleagues [48] showed that an intervention that reduced endorsement of SDO increased environmentalism. Future research ought to continue exploring the potentially causal nature of the ideology-environmentalism association. In the case of environmental action, this research also offers hope that if environmental action can be achieved and sustained, this might flow through to reducing endorsement of SDO and its correlates (e.g., prejudice [3]).

Strengths and limitations

Our research uses a nationally representative sample, meaning that our results are highly generalisable, at least to the New Zealand population. We have also replicated the initially surprising finding of a stronger temporal association between environmentalism and SDO [15], which increases our confidence in this directional relationship. Despite this, there are some limitations of our study to address. As our research was survey-based, and participants' responses were restricted to Likert-type responses to question items. Although this is a sufficient way to test people's attitudes and results from the autoregressive paths indicate the scores are stable over a five-year interval, it is unclear why participants chose the response options that they chose. Specifically, from our results we cannot pinpoint the rationale behind why those less willing to behave pro-environmentally score higher in SDO. Future research could expand on our knowledge of the ideology-environmentalism link by using qualitative methods, such as an interview study, that probes the rationale behind people's attitudes on the environment. Exploiting the environment might be less about dominance over nature, and more about dominance over others by way of the environment (as in [5]). This is an important distinction, given that the motivation underlying Social Dominant's opposition to environmental action might affect how they interpret information about climate change.","Social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) are ideological attitudes that predict lower concern for the environment and less willingness to act on climate change. Research generally shows that SDO and RWA exhibit moderate, negative relationships with environmentalism. We examine the longitudinal influence of SDO and RWA on people's willingness to change their behaviour to benefit the environment in a national probability sample over five years. We show that both ideological attitudes relate to lower environmentalism across time and that the SDO effect was stronger than the RWA effect, yet the association from environmentalism to later endorsement of SDO is stronger than the reverse. Interestingly, these findings suggest that the more likely temporal association flows from environmentalism to SDO.","2",0,"2","Political",2,0

Social psychological and personality science, 10(4), 494-503.","The present set of studies, comprising five independent samples across 16 Western countries and four decades, establishes that political conservatives report greater meaning in life than liberals at all reporting periods (global, daily, and momentary). Even when fine-grained analyses found quadratic relationships, this pattern remained. The relationship was generally robust after adjusting statistically for religiosity, which suggests that there is some unique aspect of political conservatism that provides people with meaning and purpose in life.
In three of the four studies that included multiple well-being measures, the relationship between political orientation and meaning in life was stronger than the relationship between political orientation and satisfaction with life or other well-being measures. Support for this was found by constraining coefficients and by demonstrating that the relationship between political orientation and meaning in life remained significant after adjusting for religiosity, whereas relationships involving other well-being measures were usually no longer significant after adjusting for religiosity. These findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that specific eudaimonic measures of well-being, such as meaning and purpose in life, are distinct from evaluative and experiential measures (e.g., Tov & Lee, 2015).
One exception is worth noting. Although conservatives reported greater meaning in life and greater life satisfaction in all studies, the strength of the relationship between political orientation and meaning in life did not significantly exceed the relationship involving satisfaction with life in Study 1a based on the European Values Survey. This exception may reflect cultural and historical differences (the data were collected 1981‚Äì1984) as well as differences in question wording (the meaning in life measure was negatively worded in the European Value Survey, but positively worded in Studies 1b‚Äì4).
Given the correlational nature of the present data, any conjectures about why conservatives report more meaning in life than liberals are to be treated with great caution. It is possible and plausible that third variables, such as a child‚Äôs upbringing and community expectations, can foster a conservative political orientation as well as more meaning in life. In such cases, mediation analyses, which assume causal relationships (MacKinnon, Krull, & Lockwood, 2000; Preacher, 2015), can be misleading.
This said, our data constrain the range of likely candidate variables. Recall that social conservatism (in form of opposition to abortion and gay marriage) was a better predictor of meaning in life than economic conservatism, whereas the reverse was true for life satisfaction (Study 2). Previous research suggested that the observed link between economic conservatism and life satisfaction can be traced to rationalization of inequality (Napier & Jost, 2008), one of the two key components of conservatism (Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, & Sulloway, 2003). The second component, resistance to change, is more closely related to social conservatism, which involves opposition to cultural changes. This suggests that aspects of resistance to change may contribute to the observed relationship between conservatism and meaning in life. This conjecture is compatible with the observation that conservatism also relates to stability and coherence, situational factors that can increase the subjective experience of meaning in life (Heintzelman, Trent, & King, 2013; Kay, Laurin, Fitzsimons, & Landau, 2014). Future research may fruitfully address these possibilities.
Regarding possible implications, it is important to realize the limitations of the current findings. In terms of variance explained, the effect of political orientation on meaning in life was relatively small (effect sizes ranged from r = .09 to r = .21), consistent with the relationship between political orientation and life satisfaction (summarized in Onraet et al., 2013). However, small effect sizes are a common feature of well-being research, and the effect sizes were comparable to the size of the effects of income and subjective health on meaning in life.
In sum, we have examined the relationship between political orientation and well-being by considering a more holistic view of well-being that includes evaluative, experiential, and eudaimonic well-being at various reporting periods. Overall, our findings show that conservatives report greater meaning in life than liberals, and this effect is stronger and more robust than the effects previously found for evaluative and experiential well-being.","Conservatives report greater life satisfaction than liberals, but this relationship is relatively weak. To date, the evidence is limited to a narrow set of well-being measures that ask participants for a single assessment of their life in general. We address this shortcoming by examining the relationship between political orientation and well-being using measures of life satisfaction, affect, and meaning and purpose in life. Participants completed well-being measures after reflecting on their whole life (Studies 1a, 1b, and 2), at the end of their day (Study 3), and in the present moment (Study 4). Across five studies, conservatives reported greater meaning and purpose in life than liberals at each reporting period. This finding remained significant after adjusting for religiosity and was usually stronger than the relationships involving other well-being measures. Finally, meaning in life was more closely related to social conservatism than economic conservatism.","6",0,"6","Political",5,0
112,20,"Shepherd, S., & Campbell, T. (2020). The effect of egocentric taste judgments on stereotyping of welfare recipients and attitudes toward welfare policy. Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, 39(1), 1-14.","Past work has investigated predictors of general welfare attitudes; however, many debates and policies deal with specific purchases. Our research suggests that attitudes toward these specific policies can vary considerably, depending on how much one personally values the purchase in question. This finding contrasts with other work emphasizing the relative immunity of personal tastes to social judgments (Kramer, Maimaran, and Simonson 2012; Savani, Markus, and Connern 2008; Stigler and Becker 1977). Instead, we observe that consumers easily judge others‚Äô purchases based on personal tastes and that existing welfare stereotypes allow these egocentric judgments of value to inform broader character judgments.

The current research echoes the call to ‚Äúmove beyond judgmental rhetoric‚Äù (Hill and Macan 1996) but also highlights challenges in accomplishing this. Consistent with Eyal, Steffel, and Epley (2018), we found that egocentric biases are very difficult to overcome, and even those who have received welfare before and those traditionally sympathetic to welfare recipients showed an egocentric bias in evaluating welfare recipients and policy. While many purchasing decisions made by poor consumers can be seen as rational when one appreciates their situation and constraints (Mullainathan and Shafir 2013; Sawady and Tescher 2008), many policymakers may lack the information or desire to understand how various constraints (e.g., time, money, living in a food desert, poor access to transit) influence welfare recipients‚Äô purchasing decisions.

Recent work has also called for an intersectional approach to policy that does not view disadvantage through a single-factor lens (Corus et al. 2016). However, even among those most empathetic and sympathetic, personal lenses can still be limited to one‚Äôs idiosyncratic preferences and sense of value. From an intersectional perspective, our research suggests that multiple factors may create the opportunity for egocentric judgments. For example, a woman may make purchases that are not relevant to men, or a minority-group consumer may make a culturally relevant food purchase that is unappealing to a majority-group observer. Exploring how group differences affect judgments may be important to future policy and debiasing research.

The current research further highlights practical issues in regulating welfare recipients with too much granularity. Deciding what can or cannot be purchased or what assistance should or should not be offered is challenging even when relatively concrete categories exist (Schanzenbach 2017) and may be further complicated by egocentrism. Moreover, even if additional costly monitoring and restrictions could prevent certain purchases from being made (which is dubious in itself; Schanzenbach 2017), purchases could still be judged on the basis of the observer‚Äôs idiosyncratic tastes. While many profess concern for preserving the dignity and independence of those who receive welfare, stereotyping and increased monitoring are unlikely to facilitate this aim. In contrast, allowing for occasional indulgences can bring some sense of normalcy, enjoyment, and dignity (Hill 1994; Hill and Macan 1996).

A troubling conclusion of the current research is that egocentrism may add to existing sources of stigma and cannot be easily predicted. Thus, advocates may find it useful to focus on promoting policy and available options that make spending more private. For example, self-checkout machines incidentally add privacy to one‚Äôs purchase, and Amazon has recently announced a discounted membership rate for recipients of federal assistance (Perkins 2017; Picchi 2017). Although the use of SNAP funds for online transactions is only in a pilot phase (U.S. Department of Agriculture 2017), this method could be beneficial in reducing judgment.

Our work also offers caveats regarding some current practices aimed at reducing welfare stigma. For instance, poverty simulation and ‚ÄúSNAP challenge‚Äù initiatives allow consumers to experience living on a very limited budget firsthand. Giving people firsthand experience of the realities and constraints faced by welfare recipients (as opposed to perspective taking) may positively shape welfare attitudes. On the other hand, one may complete the challenge more easily than actual welfare recipients would (e.g., because of geographical location or easy accessibility of preferred items), fail to account for the idiosyncratic priorities and constraints that others face, and conclude that others fail because of their poor decision-making.

Finding reduced or nonsignificant effects for healthy foods (Study 1c) and necessities (Study 3) leads to the seemingly obvious and intuitive suggestion that advocates emphasize buying healthy foods and necessities. However, this approach has its challenges, as healthy diets are more expensive and difficult to maintain (Mulik and Haynes-Maslow 2017; Rao et al. 2013). Healthy food also may not be accessible (i.e., in food deserts). Improving access to healthy food may not only help welfare recipients but also improve general attitudes toward welfare recipients. However, even healthy foods can be seen as inappropriate purchases for welfare recipients (e.g., organic food; Olson et al. 2016).

Our research suggests that information campaigns to specifically combat the stereotype of irresponsibility (e.g., highlighting the ways that welfare recipients budget and cleverly stretch their dollars) may be beneficial. Likewise, offering budgeting apps and money management counseling may not only benefit welfare recipients but also shape the public‚Äôs view of welfare recipients (to the extent that they see welfare recipients using these services).

An understanding of egocentrism may also benefit future policy research more broadly. Egocentric processes can be erroneously used in decision-making whenever (1) the decision-maker or voter is not directly affected by the policy and (2) those affected are thought to have different tastes, priorities, and constraints. Examples include male-dominated governments making decisions for women, such as whether menstrual products are taxed and the availability of birth control products. Such processes may be especially problematic when egocentric judgments of a purchase appear to be relevant to inferences about another group (e.g., having negative views of sexual agency in women and believing that certain products promote promiscuity).

Together, these studies help us understand attitudes toward welfare policy and suggest a new way to think about many controversial policy issues. Although rational factors such as self-interest or explicit arguments based on ideology are certainly important in shaping policy attitudes, hidden behind these factors may be more basic psychological processes like egocentrism that play an important but heretofore unobserved role.","Despite the centrality of purchasing behavior and choice to the welfare debate, research has generally understood attitudes toward welfare at a broader level and as a function of rational or deliberative processes (e.g., self-interest, ideology). This project identifies the effect of egocentrism on welfare attitudes, finding that a welfare recipient's purchase of an item that the participant personally values less (vs. more) leads to increased stereotyping of welfare recipients (e.g., irresponsibility, impulsivity) and favorable attitudes toward policy that would restrict that purchase. This effect is illustrated for both chronic and situational preferences and across a number of products commonly debated in welfare policy. The authors find that egocentrism is robust to debiasing; therefore, tests of boundary conditions involved countering the stereotype of irresponsibility rather than the bias itself. For example, the effects do not emerge in the context of healthy foods and necessities, nor when information suggests that the target consumer is otherwise responsible (e.g., budgeting, clipping coupons). Implications for policy and welfare advocacy are discussed. In general, these findings establish how personal preferences may shape attitudes toward marginalized consumers and related policy.","4",0,"4","Political",2,1

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 118(14), e2013464118.","In this article, we demonstrate a methodological framework for studying the effect of social media and the internet on individuals. By embedding a naturalistic encouragement in an online panel survey with linked digital trace data, our design achieves ecological validity without sacrificing internal validity (45). This approach does not come without costs: our intervention was necessarily a bundle, although multiple survey waves allowed us to prespecify and test for different pathways of influence. While our sample enables fairly precise estimates of main effects, we are generally not well powered to test for subgroup effects (see SI Appendix for analyses of heterogeneous effects by party, ideology, and pretreatment media consumption).

The longitudinal nature of our data enables us to study the cumulative effects of a relatively strong intervention: increased real-world exposure to either a left-leaning or right-leaning partisan news source. Encouraging people to alter their online information environments in this way seems to work on a basic level: it can increase awareness of recent political events. However, for most of the kinds of outcomes frequently studied by social scientists‚Äîsuch as voting behavior, agenda-setting, and affective polarization‚Äîwe do not find strong evidence of direct influence. Despite the seismic technological, societal, and political shifts of the past 75 years, this evidence is consistent with a tradition of research on media‚Äôs minimal effects arising out of the Second World War (16).

In assessing the generalizability of our findings, we consider how the experimental participants who complied with the treatment differ from the population. In a best-case scenario for strong effects, we could have had compliers who are infrequent news consumers, highly inattentive, and with weak political preferences, or in the other extreme, compliers could have been partisan, frequent consumers of political news with more crystallized attitudes. As shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S12, the compliers in this study are comparable to the overall sample in many important respects, including pretreatment visits to Fox News/HuffPost, ideology, and age, although they are notably more interested in politics (more than 80% of compliers have very high political interest compared to an already-high 70% in the full sample).

Thus, while our treatments did not simply increase the partisan news consumption of people who already visit such websites, they did successfully encourage people who tended to have a higher interest in politics to begin with. For this reason, it may be reasonable to think of our findings on attitudes and behavior as closer to the lower bound of possible effects as compared to research focusing on compliers with a different, less politically engaged profile (20). Further, our study was conducted during the Trump presidency, when a polarized and high-volume political media environment plausibly pretreated these engaged citizens, potentially attenuating the effects of our randomized encouragements (46). Understanding the limited effects of exposure to partisan media on relatively engaged partisans is itself of substantive interest, given the outsize visibility and political influence of this group (8). At the same time, it is precisely people with these characteristics‚Äîinterested in politics but not frequent partisan news consumers‚Äîwho may have less crystallized views about the media in general.

Our suggestive results on the long-term consequences of increased exposure to online partisan news for overall trust in the media point to a possible resolution of a related puzzle in research on consumption of online news and its effects: controlled experiments have often found that exposure to partisan media content causes polarization, although whether this is driven by the inadvertent audience (11) or already polarized partisans (27, 47) remains the subject of debate. At the same time, fine-grained evidence on people‚Äôs online news diets reveals that the actual consumption of partisan content is limited and that exposure to cross-cutting information is relatively common on the web and on social media (3, 8, 48, 49). If echo chambers are not as common as popular discourse suggests, then can online partisan media be to blame for polarization (50)?

Our findings on lowered overall trust in mainstream media suggest an answer: even if people are regularly exposed to content (partisan or not) that challenges them, they may more heavily discount it as their trust and confidence in news decreases. In this way, partisan media can help drive polarization‚Äîalthough not necessarily by influencing opinions directly, as the null effects on our index of issue positions indicate. This conclusion has mixed normative implications: it may be more difficult than ever for people to be swayed by potentially inflammatory partisan content encountered on the internet, but this may come at the cost of reduced trust in crucial informational intermediaries that work to sustain agreement on a shared set of facts and norms. This is an important topic for continued research.

In a direct test of the power of defaults to structure the information environment, our primary nudge urged participants to set their browser homepages‚Äîan option they may not have been aware existed (51). As illustrated by our tracking data, this simple change had a lasting impact on downstream web consumption, suggesting that a behavioral science perspective can usefully be applied to people‚Äôs interactions with internet media (52). The intervention can be interpreted as boosting incidental exposure to partisan content in a way that might be comparable to seeing posts from weak ties on social media (e.g., retweets or reshares) that are more likely to be political and counterattitudinal in nature. Taken together, our findings point to the conclusion that despite today‚Äôs extremely high-choice media environment (53), frictions and ‚Äúarchitectures of serendipity‚Äù (50) can still, at least in principle, allow for engagement with different perspectives in the news.","What role do ideologically extreme media play in the polarization of society? Here we report results from a randomized longitudinal field experiment embedded in a nationally representative online panel survey (N = 1,037) in which participants were incentivized to change their browser default settings and social media following patterns, boosting the likelihood of encountering news with either a left-leaning (HuffPost) or right-leaning (Fox News) slant during the 2018 US midterm election campaign.

Data on ‚âà 19 million web visits by respondents indicate that resulting changes in news consumption persisted for at least 8 weeks. Greater exposure to partisan news can cause immediate but short-lived increases in website visits and knowledge of recent events. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, however, we find little evidence of a direct impact on opinions or affect. Still, results from later survey waves suggest that both treatments produce a lasting and meaningful decrease in trust in the mainstream media up to one year later.

Consistent with the minimal-effects tradition, direct consequences of online partisan media are limited, although our findings raise questions about the possibility of subtle, cumulative dynamics. The combination of experimentation and computational social science techniques illustrates a powerful approach for studying the long-term consequences of exposure to partisan news.

Science, 329(5989), 325-327.","With more than 5 million riders per year, there is a potential annual increase of more than $600,000 in profits. Does increased photo purchasing crowd out spending elsewhere in the amusement park (e.g., for popcorn or gifts)? Clearly, if SSR merely cannibalizes another element of the business, we should be more circumspect in our inferences. Although we cannot speak to every possible case of crowding out, our data suggest that this is not the case. Immediately after leaving the photo area, customers passed through a merchandise area (containing T-shirts, keychains, etc.). Total sales data from those days (Table 1) suggest that increased photo revenue does not lead to decreased merchandise revenue in the immediate store, but future research is needed to thoroughly investigate the incidence of product cannibalization.

SSR increased profit, perhaps because it minimized suspicion of the firm‚Äôs intentions and maximized the identity expressiveness in the purchase. This contention is further supported by an intriguing piece of evidence in the purchase rates of PWYW and PWYW + Charity customers: The addition of the charitable promotion actually suppressed purchasing [œá¬≤ = 336.17, P = 0.001 (9)]. This is consistent with our explanation that with fixed prices, customers buy only when the benefits outweigh the costs. In the PWYW + Charity condition, the cost of sending a bad signal looms large, so customers with a low value for the picture will prefer not to buy it over buying it either for a low price (bad signal) or for a high price (not worth it).

Historically, company ethics are seen as competing with company economics, but our study suggests a method in which the pursuit of social good does not undermine the pursuit of profit. Under SSR, the consumer chooses a price, thereby actively determining his or her contribution to the cause. Apparently, a company can best serve its community and its shareholders by sharing its social responsibility with its customers.
","A field experiment (N = 113,047 participants) manipulated two factors in the sale of souvenir photos. First, some customers saw a traditional fixed price, whereas others could pay what they wanted (including $0). Second, approximately half of the customers saw a variation in which half of the revenue went to charity. At a standard fixed price, the charitable component only slightly increased demand, as similar studies have also found.

However, when participants could pay what they wanted, the same charitable component created a treatment that was substantially more profitable. Switching from corporate social responsibility to what we term shared social responsibility works in part because customized contributions allow customers to directly express social welfare concerns through the purchasing of material goods.","Apolitical",1,"Apolitical","Political",4,0

Mental health identification practices of jails: The unmet needs of the ‚Äúsilent‚Äù population: special issue: Criminal justice and community psychology: Our values and our work. American Journal of Community Psychology, 67(1-2), 7-20.","The disproportion of individuals in jail with mental illnesses raises questions about the services they receive within these institutions and their continuity of care as they reenter the community (Bronson & Berzofsky, 2017; Lamb & Weinberger, 1998; Steadman & Veysey, 1997; SAMHSA, 2019; Torrey et al., 2010). Mental health identification at jail booking is the first step towards jail-based service provision and can be a pivotal intervention for this carceral population, especially for individuals whose first psychiatric crisis results in an arrest and jail stay. While the APA (2016) recommends identification by trained staff and the use of a screening instrument, little is known about how jails identify individuals with mental health needs in practice. Given the variation or lack of appropriate mental health training provided to booking staff (Abu-Dagga et al., 2016; Scheyett et al., 2009), there is an increased need for the use of screening instruments to complement the lack of clinically trained staff to deliver mental health screening and assessments.

This study assessed the jail- and community-based outcomes for two methods of mental health identification used within eight county jails. Individuals identified with mental health needs by staff observation are much more likely to be referred to, and to receive, mental health services within the jail than those who were identified only by a standardized screen (with jail staff blind to results). While these findings are not surprising, since jails must prioritize services for those they identify, this study also found concerning long-term impacts when jails do not use a validated screening instrument in combination with staff observations. Those identified by the jail have almost double the odds of connecting to community-based mental health and substance use disorder services, compared to individuals identified by a screening instrument.

These differences in community-based service outcomes persist despite the fact that individuals identified by the screening instrument are riskier and in greater need of services than individuals identified by staff observation. Individuals identified by the screening instrument only had significantly higher levels of mental health symptoms and substance misuse, and yet they are the ‚Äúsilent‚Äù behavioral health population in both the jail and upon release in the community. Given that individuals with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders are at greatest risk and cost to the criminal/legal and behavioral health systems (AbuDagga et al., 2016; Wilson, Draine, Barrenger, Hadley, & Evans, 2014; Wilson, Draine, Hadley, Metraux, & Evans, 2011), their identification and connection to services are equally, if not more important than those identified by staff observation.

This study also highlights the importance of community context when considering mental health services for the criminal/legal population. Jails located in rural communities were significantly less likely to identify individuals through staff observation, compared to urban and metropolitan jails. While this study has no direct explanation for why this occurred, we surmise that the constraints associated with the provision of mental health services in the criminal/legal system (AbuDagga et al., 2016; Torrey et al., 2014) are compounded in rural communities, where lack of financial and professional resources exist (Rural Health Information Hub, 2019; U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2019).

Limitations
Although the results of this study stress the importance of mental health identification methods at jail booking, there are a number of limitations to be noted. First, these results may not be generalizable to all jails in all localities. The eight jails in this study were chosen for inclusion because of their pre-existing concern about individuals struggling with mental illness, given that the local criminal/legal and mental health systems jointly responded to a request for proposals to address this problem in their community.

These jails likely have more well-developed mental health practices and may be more likely to call on their community partners to address the needs of mental health consumers in the community, as compared to jails that do not have such collaborations or focus on behavioral health. It is also possible that staff and clinicians in these jails have greater awareness of potential community-based service options or are better trained to identify the needs of individuals with mental illness.

Second, the explained variance in the models varied across outcome analyses. For jail-based outcomes, the models explained between 5.3% (diversion) and 79.5% (referral to services) of the variance. For community-based outcomes, the models explained between 11.6% (substance use disorder service) and 19.1% of the variance (mental health service). Unsurprisingly, the models had greater explanatory power the closer the outcomes were to the point of mental health identification. Because jail identification focuses on mental illness and not substance misuse, the predictive power of the analyses is greater for mental health services, compared to substance use disorder services.

Relatedly, the community-based outcomes only captured those services billed through Medicaid health plans; as such, individuals who received their community-based services billed through private insurance or provided by the Veterans Administration were missed. Thus, the proportion of individuals receiving community-based services is under-reported in this study.

Implications for Practice and Policy
The ‚Äúsilent‚Äù population of individuals with mental health needs that went unidentified in this study had significantly greater risk factors, with greater needs of both mental health and substance use disorder services. At the local level, jails should consider strengthening mental health training of booking staff while also implementing a screening instrument to capture this population. Furthermore, the screening instrument should not only be embedded in booking practices but should be scored and utilized for decision-making for individuals referred to jail-based services.

Without a validated screen, the ‚Äúsilent‚Äù population will struggle both inside the jail and back in the community without needed health care. Conversely, jail staff also identify individuals sometimes missed on validated screens; individuals who are still in need of services who are not exhibiting acute psychological distress at the time of booking. Jointly using staff observation and a screening instrument will identify the largest group of individuals to refer to a clinician for an in-depth assessment of behavioral health needs.

Additionally, jails should consider formalizing the APA (2016) processes for identification, referral, and services. As individuals book into jail, are classified, attend court cases, and ultimately are released, it is difficult to ensure they are appropriately ‚Äúpassed‚Äù from one system (booking) to the next (medical) without formal, documented procedures.

Finally, it is recommended that jail staff and clinicians create relationships with community-based behavioral health service providers, so that individuals can successfully transition within and across systems. Strong collaborations across these systems have been shown to increase positive outcomes for individuals with mental illness in other areas of the criminal/legal system (Kubiak, Comartin, Ray, & Tillander, 2018) and could be equally helpful in the jail context.

Although more research is needed to understand the exact mechanism by which staff observation increases post-release service engagement, one possibility is that jail staff tasked with identifying, referring, and serving this population are able to provide discharge planning services that include information about existing resources in the community.

One of the primary goals of these collaborative efforts is to reduce inequities between those with serious mental illness (SMI) and those without SMI in criminal/legal settings, which are extensive and create a feedback loop that often produces more harm. For example, individuals with SMI experience longer jail stays than those without SMI, which often derails treatment for their behavioral health stability, resulting in social inequities in access to and opportunity to use health care.

To achieve social justice for the full population who must be held in jails, identification of their behavioral health needs is critical to continued care along the criminal/legal continuum. However, even when jails center mental health needs by providing access to services, without a standardized mental health screen, a new division is created that ultimately leads to additional inequities: those with SMI who are known to jails, and those with SMI who are not known to jails.

Social justice aims to equally disseminate resources and opportunities for all individuals in jails. As seen in this research, the identification of mental illness in jails has very real, long-lasting impacts on treatment engagement for individuals with mental illness.","The overrepresentation of individuals with mental illness in the criminal/legal system is well-documented. While professional associations urge diversion towards treatment, little is known about the practices these institutions use to identify this population. One understudied space in the criminal/legal continuum is jails.

This exploratory study compares two types of mental health identification at jail booking to assess jail- and community-based service outcomes by identification type (N = 2956): (a) staff observation and (b) a standardized screening instrument. Individuals identified through staff observation were significantly more likely to receive jail- and community-based services, even though current symptomology and substance misuse were both significantly higher for individuals identified only by the screening instrument.

These findings point to the importance of jails in providing stabilizing services during incarceration, but further, show the impact that identification practices have on individuals as they transition to the community. Community context showed varied rates of jail staff observations of mental illness, showing greater risks for individuals in rural communities.

Implications include a need for system-level changes by instituting evidence-based identification practices in jails, and improving professional collaboration practices between mental health and criminal/legal practitioners as individuals enter and exit jails.","4",0,"4","Political",2,1
117,21,"Green-Hennessy, S. (2014). Homeschooled adolescents in the United States:  Developmental outcomes.  Journal of Adolescence, 37(4): 441-449. ","In their recent review of the literature, Kunzman and Gaither (2013, p. 13) noted that the distinction between pedagogical and ideological homeschoolers has remained ‚Äúremarkably resilient.‚Äù This study suggests that this distinction continues to be helpful in understanding the social and academic needs of subgroups of homeschoolers. Although this study does not directly assess pedagogical philosophy among the less-religiously affiliated homeschoolers, linking the findings to Van Galen‚Äôs dichotomy may be productive in attempting to understand the data.

Among homeschooling ‚Äúideologues,‚Äù religion plays a significant social role, with 40.7% responding that it is important for friends to share their religious beliefs and 20.7% reporting that the source of all their activities during the prior year was faith- or church-based. Despite some lack of variability in the source of activities, religious homeschoolers showed many strengths in terms of outcomes, being the least likely to be delinquent or substance disordered of the four groups. Consistent with prior literature (Salas-Wright et al., 2012), religious affiliation appeared to serve as a buffer against these externalizing behaviors.

This group, however, did show difficulties with self-reported grade level, being twice as likely to report their current grade level to be two or more years behind the expected grade level for their age. This conflicts with prior studies (Belfield, 2004; Cogan, 2010; Martin-Chang et al., 2011), which have found homeschoolers to have better academic outcomes than traditionally schooled students. This discrepancy could reflect the inexact nature of the academic outcome variable used in this study, which was based on adolescent self-report. On the other hand, some have questioned prior findings given concerns regarding sample representativeness (Martin-Chang et al., 2011). Nationally representative studies using objective assessments of academic outcomes are needed.

Less religious homeschoolers, the group that may be more analogous to Van Galen‚Äôs ‚Äúpedagogues,‚Äù appeared to struggle more than their religious counterparts. While not more likely to be delinquent or have a substance disorder than traditionally schooled students with similar levels of religious affiliation, over a third of less religious homeschoolers (34.7%) reported that their parents had lax attitudes toward them misusing substances, and 18.2% denied having received any substance prevention messages in the prior year. Previous research has found both of these factors to be associated with an increased risk of future substance misuse (Donovan, 2004; Faggiano, Vigna-Taglianti, Versino, Zambon, & Borraccino, 2008; Malmberg et al., 2012; Sargent & Dalton, 2001).

In addition to the future risk of substance issues, 23.4% of less religious homeschoolers had not engaged in any extracurricular activities during the prior year, raising current concerns of social isolation. Lastly, 13.6% of this group reported their grade level to be two or more years behind that reported by similarly aged peers. With respect to this last finding, less religious homeschooling families could be more likely to use an ‚Äúunschooling‚Äù approach, thereby making grade level less meaningful for this particular group. However, both homeschooling groups reported being behind the expected grade level, though to different degrees.

It is also possible that the difficulty could lie with homeschooling itself, or it could be that parents who chose to homeschool do so because the school system has failed to meet their child‚Äôs educational needs (Parsons & Lewis, 2010). If the latter is true, such children may well have been struggling academically before homeschooling commenced. Unfortunately, information regarding participants‚Äô prior educational progress and/or special educational needs was not available with the NSDUH.

Limitations
Another limitation arises from the NSDUH‚Äôs method of classifying homeschooled youth. While retaining the same question over time permits consolidation of data across the years and thereby increases statistical power, it can also result in the survey instrument not reflecting recent changes in the phenomenon. While the NSDUH‚Äôs questions continue to assume a dichotomy between homeschool and traditionally schooled youth, mixed or hybrid models of schooling have risen in popularity recently.

These hybrids, ranging from cooperatives to virtual online charter schools, blur the boundary between home and traditional schooling (Brady, Umpstead, & Eckes, 2010; Kunzman & Gaither, 2013). Future work should both speak of and assess the full continuum of schooling options (Murphy, 2012) in order to best represent the current schooling landscape.

Although a nationally representative sample, the number of homeschoolers in the NSDUH surveys was less than population estimates suggest. This could reflect the phrasing of the schooling question in the NSDUH. In evaluating how much less, it should be remembered that NSDUH data used extends back to 2002, when the number of homeschoolers was not much more than half of its current amount (USDOE, 2008).

Alternatively, it is possible that given the recent increase in hybrid models, some individuals schooled in such mixed models responded ‚Äúyes‚Äù when initially asked if they attended any type of school and consequently were not asked if they also considered themselves homeschooled. The fact that, given the sequence of the questions, not all youth were asked if they considered themselves homeschooled represents a limitation of the study.

However, even taking these issues into account, the more limited number of homeschoolers may simply reflect what Kunzman and Gaither (2013) describe as reluctance among homeschoolers to participate in government-sponsored surveys. Given that the NSDUH is not represented to participants as a study on homeschooling and, as noted on a national homeschooling website (Estrada, 2013), few of its questions are about schooling, it is possible that the NSDUH elicited less defensiveness than would be the case with a study more clearly focused on homeschooling.

However, it is also possible that homeschoolers‚Äô general wariness of federally sponsored surveys inhibited their participation, irrespective of the survey‚Äôs content (Kunzman & Gaither, 2013), thus raising questions about the self-selective nature of those who chose to participate. This issue highlights the difficulty of procuring large representative samples of homeschooled youth for study.

The fact that the NSDUH‚Äôs focus is on substance use versus schooling also represents a limitation, as the survey provides limited details on outcomes outside of substance-related ones. Additionally, the NSDUH‚Äôs response options are often categorical or recoded as such in their public-access database. Although used to facilitate increased confidentiality, this strategy precludes the use of certain analyses and may obscure more nuanced differences, such as whether groups‚Äô means differ within a given range.

Lastly, that the sample is specific to the U.S. limits the generalizability of its findings. While religious affiliation may figure importantly among U.S. homeschoolers, studies of homeschooling in other nations emphasize the importance of other factors (i.e., how dispersed the population is, the society‚Äôs ‚Äúe-maturity,‚Äù how controlling the central government is seen as, the importance the culture places on individualism and family, etc.) (Austin & Hunter, 2013; Kunzman & Gaither, 2013).
","The mission of schools has broadened beyond academics to address risk behaviors such as substance use, delinquency, and socialization problems. With an estimated 3.4% of all U.S. youth being homeschooled, this study examines how U.S. homeschoolers fare on these outcomes given their lack of access to these school services.

Adolescents (ages 12‚Äì17) from the 2002 through 2011 National Surveys of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) were divided based on school status (home vs. traditional schooling) and religious affiliation (stronger vs. weaker). Controlling for demographic differences, homeschoolers with weaker religious ties were three times more likely to report being behind their expected grade level and two and a half times more likely to report no extracurricular activities in the prior year than their traditionally schooled counterparts. This group was also more likely to report lax parental attitudes toward substance use.

Findings suggest homeschoolers with weaker religious ties represent an at-risk group.","3",1,"4","Political",4,1
118,21,"Huss, B. (2021). Well-being before and after pregnancy termination: the consequences of abortion and miscarriage on satisfaction with various domains of life. Journal of Happiness Studies, 22(6), 2803-2828.","The aim of this study was to investigate the association between termination of pregnancy‚Äîeither intended or unintended‚Äîand women‚Äôs satisfaction in different domains of life. The results show that women demonstrated substantially lower pre-event satisfaction before having an induced abortion than before giving birth. As expected, pregnancy preceding induced abortion was furthermore significantly more often unintended than was pregnancy preceding live birth. Differences were also apparent in the presence of a partner and children.

The findings emphasize that rather than being caused by the procedure itself, at least some aspects of poor well-being following an induced abortion may in fact reflect other abortion-related factors that place women ‚Äúat risk‚Äù for intentional pregnancy termination (Major et al. 2009). If compared to other women, these factors are represented by poor pre-event levels of well-being. They furthermore show that ‚Äúunwanted pregnancy and abortion do not occur in a social vacuum‚Äù (Major et al. 2009) but are embedded within a sociocultural context. This context moderates (a) how women respond to unintended pregnancies resulting in induced abortion and (b) the likelihood of deciding to have an induced abortion at all.

In contrast to induced abortion, miscarriage was not associated with substantial differences in pre-event well-being compared to women who gave birth. These results indicate that overall and domain-specific life satisfaction did not affect the probability of experiencing a miscarriage. Differences were, however, found in other areas: Before miscarriage, as compared to live birth, women were less likely to have had children, a partner, or pregnancy intentions.

Data analysis provided support for the hypothesis that women suffer temporarily following any termination of pregnancy: women showed declines in overall life satisfaction immediately after both induced abortion and miscarriage. In accordance with previous research, levels of overall life satisfaction increased in the subsequent years (Biggs et al. 2014, 2017; Broen et al. 2005). These increases, however, only reflect adjustments to pre-event levels. Although most women largely recover following induced abortion or miscarriage, the initial post-termination decline in well-being can occasionally be accompanied by serious grief and distress.

The literature offers two possible explanations for the temporary post-abortion declines in well-being: The affected women either suffer primarily (1) from the consequences of an induced abortion or (2) from the consequences of an unintended pregnancy (Steinberg and Rubin 2014). Assuming that pregnancy termination could provide a sense of self-efficacy and internal control, the decision to abort could therefore be a strategy for coping with an unintended pregnancy and possibly even facilitate adaptation to this event (see Major et al. 2009).

The results on domain-specific satisfaction offered deeper insights into the psychological consequences of both intentional and unintended termination of pregnancy. Although women experienced only temporary declines in overall life satisfaction after miscarriage, they became increasingly dissatisfied in various domains of life. Miscarriage resulted in substantially lower well-being in all domains of satisfaction than was the case before the event. These results emphasize that miscarriage is an unexpected incident with far-reaching consequences.

It often represents the loss of a profoundly desired future child that heavily concerns several areas of life for those affected (Engelhard 2004). Ample research points to disparities between partners in dealing with the loss. Such disparities contribute to misunderstanding and conflicts and might thus explain relationship and family dissatisfaction following miscarriage (Gold et al. 2010; Kersting and Wagner 2012). The declines in social contact satisfaction and leisure satisfaction may be a consequence of avoiding social and leisure activities following miscarriage.

Involuntarily nulliparous women often regard childlessness as something negative and are concerned that others view them in an unfavorable light (Miall 1986; Rich et al. 2011). Because having a live birth is generally the idealized outcome of pregnancy, these women might perceive miscarriage as a kind of failure that intensifies their fears and might consequently tend to avoid social and leisure activities following pregnancy loss.

Like miscarriage, induced abortion is also accompanied by decreasing satisfaction in many areas of life. Social contact satisfaction, leisure satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction were seen to be substantially lower following an abortion than prior to the event. Becoming increasingly dissatisfied in these areas might reflect perceptions of stigmatization and shame due to strong anti-abortion attitudes.

Existing research has shown that stigmatization can create behavioral reactions such as social withdrawal or avoidance (Major and O‚ÄôBrien 2005). Although this study did not explicitly examine this relationship, previous investigations indicate that poor social contact satisfaction following an induced abortion might be caused by stigmatization processes that are accompanied by social withdrawal (Hanschmidt et al. 2016). Largely stable levels of satisfaction in overall well-being, however, can be seen as a result of a decision-making process.

Women decide to abort because they perceive it as the most appropriate decision within their scope of action. Although the choice to have an abortion is certainly often a difficult decision with far-reaching consequences, women might associate alternative courses of action (e.g., giving birth to an unwanted or disabled child) as having more negative consequences and therefore do not regret their decision (Major et al. 2009).

The findings on the consequences of abortion add evidence to the ongoing debate on the existence of any negative psychological long-term effects of induced abortion, which are often referred to as ‚Äúpost-abortion syndrome‚Äù (Cohen 2006; Stotland 2003). Although induced abortion is accompanied by dissatisfaction in some areas of life, my analysis did not provide support for this assumption, as women who experienced induced abortion did not fare either worse or better in overall satisfaction in the long run.

These results are consistent with the notion of Bowles and colleagues that long-term psychiatric morbidity following intentional pregnancy termination is more the exception than the rule (Bowles et al. 2000). Furthermore, my analysis showed that even before terminating pregnancy, women who aborted were substantially less satisfied with life in almost all domains of well-being than other groups of women. Consequently, as induced abortion was shown to be rather a consequence than a cause of poor well-being, the term ‚Äúpre-abortion syndrome‚Äù might be more appropriate than the term ‚Äúpost-abortion syndrome‚Äù to describe the relationship between induced abortion and well-being.
","The consequences of pregnancy outcomes other than live birth on subjective well-being have rarely been analyzed in research to date. This study examines pre-event determinants as well as the temporary and long-term effects of induced abortion and miscarriage (spontaneous abortion) on satisfaction with various domains of life.

The data were derived from the German Panel Analysis of Intimate Relationships and Family Dynamics (pairfam). The longitudinal sample consists of 5,331 women of reproductive age, of whom 214 women had an induced abortion, 331 women had a miscarriage, and 1,156 women had a live birth during the observation period.

First, pre-event measures of women who had an induced abortion and women who had a miscarriage were compared with the pre-event measures of those women who gave birth. Second, fixed effects models were used to examine whether overall or domain-specific life satisfaction changed following a pregnancy termination.

The results show that pregnancies resulting in abortion or miscarriage were less frequently preceded by pregnancy intentions compared to those resulting in live birth, and that induced abortion‚Äîbut not miscarriage‚Äîwas furthermore accompanied by lower pre-event satisfaction than live birth. Following both miscarriage and induced abortion, women experienced temporary declines in overall life satisfaction and showed persistently lower satisfaction in several domains of life.

With regard to induced abortion, pre-event measures were a better predictor of overall well-being than the consequences of the event itself. Low life satisfaction might therefore be a risk factor for having an abortion rather than a result.

Sleep medicine, 46, 69-73.","Our study followed the current tendency of other mental and physical health areas by focusing on the general population, expecting to define a new path for a good quality of life by centering on prevention. The impact that sleep quality has on mental health in a non-clinical population was analyzed through three different hypotheses (H1 to H3), which were all validated. Consequently, our results demonstrated that sleep quality predicts mental health in these samples. These findings are consistent with several research studies that confirmed how sleep quality relates to psychological distress in these populations [22,39,40].

Nonetheless, our predictions were only partially confirmed since the analysis of the moderator effect of the variables ‚Äúgender,‚Äù ‚Äúage,‚Äù and ‚Äúcountry‚Äù revealed that only ‚Äúcountry‚Äù moderated the relationship between sleep quality and mental health. Although research has pointed to the importance of sociodemographic variables such as age and gender [41‚Äì46], no evidence has previously been stated on the importance of country in the relationship between sleep quality and mental health. In our study, we analyzed the possible moderator effect of gender, age, and country on this relationship.

Gender has been described throughout several studies as a sociodemographic factor associated with sleep quality, with women usually reporting more severe sleep difficulties than men [41‚Äì43]. However, gender did not moderate the association between sleep quality and mental health indicators in our sample. Nevertheless, previous literature concluded that gender differences in self-reported sleep quality are due to socioeconomic status variables [42], social roles [43], and age [41]. Although women in some societies may have fewer opportunities than men for education and, subsequently, adequate employment, there is a current tendency in other societies to normalize opportunities between women and men, which could explain why our sample did not present gender differences across countries.

Concerning the influence of age on sleep quality, the published reports have been contradictory. Some authors have confirmed that increasing age results in more subjective sleep complaints [44], while others reported that older adults were less likely to report sleep problems than younger adults [45] and middle-aged adults [46]. One possible explanation for age having no moderation effect on our sample could reside in the fact that ours was a relatively young sample, and the literature has stated that age-related sleep quality differences are more evident when comparing young or middle-aged adults with older adults.

Previous studies have confirmed cultural differences in sleep behavior across different countries [9,47,48], demonstrating that normative sleep behavior characterization is not universal. Hense and coworkers [49] analyzed night sleep in children in eight different European countries and suggested that region, culture, and environmental characteristics interfered more with sleep duration than individual factors.

On a different age strata and using data from the first wave of the World Health Organization's study on global aging and adult health (SAGE) on six middle-income countries (China, Ghana, India, Mexico, the Russian Federation, and South Africa), Gildner and coworkers [8] concluded that sleep duration and sleep quality differed among countries. Thus, we expected ‚Äúcountry‚Äù to moderate the relationship between sleep quality and mental health when comparing data from Portuguese, Spanish, and Brazilian samples.

Our study found evidence of differences between Spanish and Brazilian participants regarding how sleep quality relates to depression and stress, as well as differences between Portuguese and Brazilian participants in how sleep quality relates to depression. However, there is no corroboration of ‚Äúcountry‚Äù moderating the relationship between sleep quality and anxiety.

Moreover, there is no confirmation of differences in the relationship between sleep quality and any of the mental health indicators when comparing Portuguese and Spanish participants. There are more geographic and cultural similarities between Portugal and Spain, as neighboring European countries in the Iberian Peninsula, which may possibly explain these results.

Similarly, a large-scale global cross-sectional survey conducted on subjects from ten different countries (including Portugal, Spain, and Brazil) suggested important global variations in sleep quality and sleep aspects [50]. Moreover, differences were highlighted between Portugal and Brazil, with Brazil presenting the highest rate of napping and Portugal the lowest, as well as similarities encountered between Spain and Portugal, since both countries presented the latest bedtimes.","Introduction
Sleep quality relates to mental health in clinical and non-clinical populations. However, there is more evidence of this relationship in clinical populations. Therefore, there is a lack of evidence on how these variables relate and on which sociodemographic factors influence this relationship in non-clinical populations.

In this study, we hypothesize that in a non-clinical population, sleep quality predicts mental health indicators and that age, country, and gender moderate this relationship.

In a sample of 1,552 subjects from Portugal, Spain, and Brazil, self-reported sleep quality and mental health indicators were assessed through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21, respectively. A multivariate linear regression model was used to test the research hypotheses.

Results
This adjusted model explained 10.1%, 12.3%, and 13.1% of the variability of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress, respectively, suggesting multiple sources of variance.

Conclusions
Our results confirmed that sleep quality predicts mental health in non-clinical populations, and that the variable country is a significant moderator of this relationship.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,1

A systematic review and meta-analysis. Frontiers in psychology, 10, 2812.","The aim of the present meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy of cognitive EFs training programs in preschool children aged from 3 to 6 years old. The final dataset consisted of 32 studies published between 2009 and 2019, 21 of which had been published between 2015 and 2019, showing a trend of an increasing number of studies.

We were interested in assessing whether cognitive training could improve EFs in preschool children, comparing near and far transfer effects and analyzing various potential moderators, such as age, presence of developmental risk, and type of cognitive training.

First of all, we found evidence that cognitive training programs are beneficial for EFs in children aged between 3 and 6: the overall effect is medium (g = 0.342), but the most interesting results are that near and far transfer effects on EFs were statistically significant and that their sizes were not significantly different.

Near transfer refers to the effect of the cognitive training on the EF measures specifically trained (Working Memory, Inhibitory Control, Cognitive Flexibility, Planning, and Fluid Reasoning, as defined by Diamond, 2013). Far transfer refers to the effect of the training on EFs variables not directly trained. We expected to find a near transfer effect, as many other authors proposed (Diamond and Lee, 2011; Diamond and Ling, 2016) and confirmed in a recent meta-analysis (Kassai et al., 2019).

Previous studies did not find far transfer effects on EFs (Melby-Lerv√•g and Hulme, 2013; Sala and Gobet, 2017; Kassai et al., 2019). The present meta-analysis showed that cognitive EFs training for preschoolers produced both near and far transfer effects, with similar effect sizes (g = 0.352 and g = 0.318, respectively). Compared to Kassai et al. (2019) we found similar results in terms of near transfer (their g was 0.44), but different considering the far transfer effects (their g was 0.11).

However, our meta-analysis has important differences compared to previous ones. First, we included 32 studies specifically focused on preschoolers; secondly, we selected only cognitive training programs, excluding motor-based activities, curriculum-based programs, or mindfulness interventions; third, the present meta-analysis was based on a different set of studies (only five papers in our database were present also in the datasets of previous meta-analyses).

The younger ages of the children in the present dataset, as compared to previous meta-analytical studies, is probably the key aspect to explaining the difference in results: A far transfer effect is observable in preschoolers probably because their EFs structure is not as well-defined and separate as it becomes at older ages. Accordingly, we assume that cognitive training for improving a specific EF could affect other, not directly trained, EFs because of the intercorrelation and overlap between EFs at this developmental stage.

For instance, some authors proposed one single EF factor (Hughes et al., 2010; Wiebe et al., 2011) or two factors (Usai et al., 2014; Scionti and Marzocchi, submitted), making it plausible that the modularization of EFs is not yet completed in preschoolers.

A second important aspect is participants‚Äô age: We included the age effect in the analysis to check whether cognitive EFs training was more effective in younger vs. older preschoolers. Age, considered as a continuous variable, was found to be not significant, therefore we conclude that in this age range, cognitive EF training is similarly effective for younger and older preschool children.

In the current research, we found that EFs cognitive training programs in preschoolers are more effective for developmentally at-risk children than for children without risks. In particular, children with symptoms of ADHD benefited significantly from EFs training (g = 0.785).

Previous studies reported that children with ADHD showed a significant EF improvement after cognitive training, particularly concerning Working Memory (Klingberg et al., 2005; Holmes et al., 2010; Rapport et al., 2013). Cortese et al. (2015) found a small but significant effect of cognitive training in children with ADHD (d = 0.37), particularly on inattention symptoms (d = 0.47), but not on hyperactivity, concluding that inattention is more malleable to training than hyperactivity.

Our study, however, found an even larger effect size for EF training in children with symptoms of ADHD (g = 0.785), suggesting that training EFs in preschoolers through a cognitive program could be a useful strategy to improve their neuropsychological skills, particularly in younger children and in those with developmental disadvantages.

In our study, the effect of cognitive training on EFs development was also significant in children from low SES backgrounds (g = 0.430). Other studies demonstrated a similar effect (Blair and Raver, 2014), confirming that educational programs, even in a school setting, can be essential for reducing subsequent psychological risk factors.

Although our results confirm the higher effect of EFs training for children with ADHD or low SES, we found a significant positive effect also in children without developmental risk. This result is encouraging because it suggests that cognitive EFs training can be beneficial in an educational context (kindergarten) to strengthen cognitive development and prevent future developmental risks.

A controversial issue regarding EF cognitive training is the comparison between trained and control groups. Some researchers argue that children may benefit from EF training simply because they receive cognitive stimulation, making it difficult to isolate the specific effects of EF training. To address this, we compared trained groups with both active and non-active control groups. Contrary to our expectation, we did not find a significant difference between the two comparisons, suggesting that EF training provides benefits beyond general cognitive stimulation.

A further comparison was made to investigate whether EF training is more effective when administered individually or in a group setting. While both methods produced positive effects, group training was significantly more effective than individual training. This finding suggests that preschoolers benefit more from group-based cognitive activities, likely due to the motivation and engagement provided by a social learning environment.

Another variable we examined was the impact of computerized versus non-computerized training. While computerized programs are often considered engaging for children, our results did not find a significant advantage of computerized over non-computerized training. This finding aligns with prior studies suggesting that non-digital activities such as card games, body exercises, and paper-and-pencil tasks may be more effective for improving EFs.

Training length was also analyzed, and while the number of sessions did not significantly impact outcomes, the total training duration did. This supports previous findings that longer and more sustained training programs yield better cognitive improvements.

Finally, we examined whether EF training had spillover effects on other psychological domains such as learning prerequisites and behavioral aspects. Our results did not find a significant effect (g = 0.10), reinforcing the difficulty of generalizing EF training benefits beyond cognitive processes.
","In the present meta-analysis, we examined the effect of cognitive training on the Executive Functions (EFs) of preschool children (age range: 3‚Äì6 years). We selected a final set of 32 studies from 27 papers with a total sample of 123 effect sizes.

We found an overall effect of cognitive training for improving EF (g = 0.352; k = 123; p < 0.001), without significant difference between near and far transfer effects on executive domains. No significant additional outcome effects were found for behavioral- and learning-related outcomes.

Cognitive training programs for preschoolers are significantly more effective for developmentally at-risk children (ADHD or low socio-economic status) than for children with typical development and without risks. Other significant moderators were: individual vs. group sessions and length of training. The number of sessions and computerized vs. non-computerized training were not significant moderators.

This is the first demonstration of cognitive training for transfer effects among different executive processes. We discuss this result in relationship to the lower level of modularization of EFs in younger children.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,1
121,21,"Vezzoli, M., Zogmaister, C., & Coen, S. (2023). Love, desire, and problematic behaviors: Exploring young adults‚Äô smartphone use from a uses and gratifications perspective. Psychology of Popular Media, 12(1), 50.","This study aimed to understand whether and how the gratifications related to smartphone usage (Vanden Abeele, 2016) are associated with individuals‚Äô smartphone time-of-use and PSU scores. The results of two regression analyses indicated that using the smartphone for signaling status and passing time predicted both PSU scores and self-reported usage time. However, some gratifications exclusively predicted PSU scores but not usage time (i.e., security and avoidance), whereas others were associated with usage time but not PSU scores (i.e., relations and school). These results suggest that PSU scores and time of use are differentially related to individuals‚Äô smartphone gratifications, thus supporting the notion that the time individuals spend using smartphones may not always be a good indicator of PSU (Panova & Carbonell, 2018).

Relatedly, the results further emphasize that to understand the emergence of PSU, it is important to consider what people are doing with their smartphones and why they use them. This study considered a set of ways and reasons why people use smartphones, represented by the eight dimensions derived from the U&G theory. Previous research has shown that process usage (e.g., news consumption, entertainment, relaxation) is more associated with PSU than social usage (e.g., social networking, messaging; Elhai, Levine, et al., 2017; Van Deursen et al., 2015). Other researchers found that PSU levels differ between hedonic, social, and utilitarian gratifications (Gan & Li, 2018). Future research may expand this research area by focusing on other relevant motivations and gratifications for using the smartphone, such as stress relief, spontaneity (Lee et al., 2014), instrumental use, and self-expression (Meng et al., 2020).

Previous research showed, for example, how transdiagnostic psychopathologies can predict the development of PSU (Rozgonjuk et al., 2019). Our results suggest that other psychological issues (e.g., social anxiety and feeling in danger) could be contributing factors to the development of PSU. Future research should explore the effect of these other psychological issues and whether addressing the underlying conditions might provide a useful pathway to intervention. It is important to notice, however, that evidence shows that smartphones are at times perceived by users as ‚Äúsocial companions‚Äù in and for themselves (Carolus et al., 2019). Future research could explore the relationship between perception of the smartphone as a social companion and PSU.

As gratifications play an important role in defining the relationship between individuals and their smartphones, the second aim of the study was to identify profiles of smartphone usage and understand how these profiles differ. These profiles might help identify specific usage patterns associated with problematic use. This will allow the development of ad hoc mitigation strategies. We identified five clusters that differed significantly according to gender, time-of-use, and PSU scores: The ‚Äústatus‚Äù cluster showed the greatest mean levels of PSU, indicating that those who use their smartphones mostly for signaling status or avoiding face-to-face interactions had a greater probability of showing PSU. Instead, the ‚Äúnonstrategic‚Äù cluster showed the lowest mean level of PSU. Smartphone usage time significantly differed across clusters but to a lesser extent than PSU scores. Specifically, individuals in the ‚Äúpragmatics‚Äù and ‚Äúnonstrategic‚Äù clusters used their smartphones for less time than the other clusters.

These results, taken together, tell us that the gratifications individuals gain by using their smartphones are associated differently with the time they spend using them and their level of problematic use. Thus, although the identified groups show little difference in the amount of time spent using the smartphone, the motivations for using it are more likely to differentiate the clusters on the level of problematic use.

Finally, women respondents were more numerous in the ‚Äúpragmatics‚Äù and ‚Äúsocial butterflies‚Äù clusters. The majority of men fell within the ‚Äústrategic‚Äù cluster, followed by ‚Äúnonstrategics‚Äù and ‚Äúpragmatics‚Äù clusters. This suggests that smartphone use can be linked to socialization patterns (Vanden Abeele et al., 2014; Wilska, 2003). The participants‚Äô age and age of first smartphone possession did not differ across clusters.

Overall, gender and time of usage differences between usage profiles suggest that people with different characteristics may have different needs to fulfill and, thus, use the smartphone more or less frequently. For example, heavy users use the smartphone more for gaining status and avoiding in-person interactions than soft users do. However, it is worth mentioning that such differences between usage profiles may also signal specific pathways that may lead to the development of PSU. Following the ‚Äúsupermarket‚Äù analogy introduced earlier, it is not enough to know that the young adult visits the corner store late at night; it is important to see if they buy liquor or groceries. This will help us better understand whether we are in front of a problem.

For example, if we found that soft users use the smartphone more in a pragmatic way, that is, because they need to microcoordinate and for security reasons, this would reassure us that their increased use of the smartphone is not problematic. However, if they use it more for status, this might be a pointer that we are in front of a problem that needs to be solved.

It should be noted that the data for this research were collected during the COVID-19 epidemic‚Äìimposed lockdown. The U&G scale asks participants to describe their smartphone usage in general. We cannot assume that participants accurately evaluated their smartphone usage, parceling out the use associated with the current lockdown situation. Some of the differences between clusters may have been exacerbated or reduced by the contingent situation of imposed social distancing. In the future, it will be interesting to investigate if the specific pattern of results will remain stable in the absence of social distancing as well.

A further limitation of this study was using a self-report measure for assessing individuals‚Äô smartphone usage time. Vanden Abeele et al. (2013) found that individuals, particularly heavy users, tend to underestimate the time they spend with their smartphones. According to Schwarz and Oyserman (2001), when people have to report frequently occurring behaviors (e.g., smartphone use), the likelihood of getting a biased self-report is higher, possibly because of poor representation of these types of behavior in memory. Thus, estimates of the frequency with which these behaviors occur are hard to make (Tourangeau et al., 2000). Future research could address this aspect by measuring the actual usage time using behavioral data retrieved from participants‚Äô smartphones.

However, we believe that, despite the specific lockdown conditions in which the data were collected and the use of the self-reported smartphone usage time, this research delivers two important messages. On the one hand, the results show that individuals‚Äô gratifications from using their smartphones differently predict the time spent using them and PSU scores. This suggests that, at least theoretically, it would be incorrect to consider smartphone problematic use as an addiction. On the other hand, our data show that usage profiles based on individuals‚Äô gratifications for using smartphones differ more in the level of problematic use than the amount of time spent using the smartphone. Therefore, our study suggests it would be useful to design interventions aimed at reducing specific uses that are shown to be associated with problematic consequences.","In light of the pervasive adoption of smartphones, scholars have explored the consequences of problematic (i.e., excessive and uncontrolled) use of this technology. Studies have often shown that individuals who spend much time using smartphones experience symptoms similar to those of substance addiction. However, considering the number of hours spent on smartphones as a criterion for measuring problematic use does not account for what people do with their smartphones and why.

This study aims to understand what gratifications are related to smartphone usage time and problematic use. Second, it aims to understand whether different usage profiles are identifiable from those gratifications and how they differ in terms of problematic use, time-of-use, and sociodemographic characteristics.

The data from 528 Italian university students were collected through a cross-sectional design. Through regression analyses, we found that smartphone gratifications differentially predict the amount of time spent using the smartphone and the level of problematic use that students exhibited. Using the K-means clustering technique, we identified 5 usage profiles that differed in the amount of time spent using smartphones and, to a greater extent, in their problematic use levels.

Personality and Individual Differences, 161, 109962.","In our data, SES explained considerable variance in IQ score differences between all racial/ethnic groups studied and at all ages. We found that SES explained virtually all the variance in IQ score differences between White and Hispanic groups, and a significantly less though still substantial amount of the variance between White and AA groups. We also found that SES explained significantly more variance in IQ score differences between racial and ethnic groups for younger participants and less variance for older participants.

Nonetheless, it is indisputable that intelligence contains a large and powerful heritable component. A large body of evidence shows that about 50% of individual differences in personality and mental ability are accounted for by genetics (Plomin, 2018). What has been debated in the literature is the generalizability and sustainability of environmental mediators of genetic potential. The theory that cognitively enriching or impoverishing environments enhance or inhibit cognitive development is consistent with many models of intellectual development (e.g., Cici, 1996; Scarr-Salpatek, 1971; Selita & Kovas, 2019), which presume generalizable and sustainable effects on cognitive development from advantaged/disadvantaged environments. However, Jensen (1997) presented data demonstrating that positive environmental stimuli result in localized increases in narrow abilities unrelated to the g factor and do not generalize.

Developmental theories of intelligence would predict that disadvantaged children adopted into advantaged families or given enriched educational programming will outperform their peers. Findings from early adoption studies were mixed. For example, Scarr and colleagues found evidence for the environmental malleability of IQ in studies of AA children adopted into White families (Scarr & Weinberg, 1976; Weinberg, Scarr & Waldman, 1992), whereas Lynn and colleagues found support for a genetically programmed pattern of abilities of Asian children adopted into White families in Belgium (Frydman & Lynn, 1989). However, recent meta-analyses have shown that IQ subtest score gains from adoption (te Nijenhuis, Jongeneel-Grimen & Armstrong, 2015) and Headstart programs (te Nijenhuis, Jongeneel-Grimen & Kirkegaard, 2014) are not on the g factor, supporting Jensen's early claim.

Theories proposing environmental influences on intellectual development set up a testable prediction, sometimes called the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis (Scarr, 1971), whereby groups of people living in relatively disadvantaged environments would be predicted to display lower heritability and higher environmentality of intelligence. Heritability by SES interactions have been relatively well studied. Tucker-Drob and Bates (2016) performed a meta-analysis of Gene x SES interactions on intelligence and academic achievement test scores. In U.S. studies, they found clear support for a moderately sized Gene x SES interaction on intelligence, with greater heritability for higher SES, thus providing some support. In studies from Western Europe and Australia, they reported that Gene x SES effects were near zero or reversed. Tucker-Drob et al. attributed the cross-national differences to social policies in Western Europe and Australia, which ensure more uniform access to high-quality education and health care.

Our study did not measure heritability and makes no claims about genetics. Our study is about environmental influences on the non-heritable portion of intellectual development. However, we interpret our findings as partially consistent with Tucker-Drob et al.‚Äôs findings for U.S.-based studies in that SES appeared to differentially mediate intelligence. In our data, controlling for SES explained the least variance in IQ score differences in the W-AA comparisons and the most in the W-H comparisons, suggesting more pronounced environmental effects on intelligence in arguably the most disadvantaged group.

Plomin (2018) provides a possible counterpoint to our interpretation in arguing that many variables traditionally considered environmental may be strongly heritable. For example, he proposes that while SES is generally considered an environmental influence, an adult's SES also could be viewed as a measure of their educational attainment, which is heritably linked to intelligence. Thus, Plomin argues that much of one's environment can be viewed as an expression of one's genetics; that is, the SES of a developing child is inherited in a sense because the parent's genetic intelligence results in educational and occupational outcomes directly linked to higher or lower socioeconomic conditions for their offspring.

However, Plomin's rationale may not account for the possible impact of historical discrimination in restricting the range of SES-related environmental variables in AA samples. Further, U.S. Hispanic samples will not reflect the full distribution of cognitive ability found in their country of origin when lower SES groups disproportionately immigrate. Other researchers have argued that heritability is an index of fairness or social justice because when access to quality education is unequal, differences in academic outcomes are a function of socioeconomic conditions (Selita & Kovas, 2019","Mediators of IQ score differences of Whites with Hispanics and African Americans are reviewed in the WISC-IV, WISC-V, and WAIS-IV. Mediators included parent education, income, and academic expectations for children and adolescents, and self-education, income, and occupation for adults. Results showed that these variables account for substantial portions of variance in all group comparisons, but least for African Americans and adults.

The critical influence of cognitively enriching and impoverishing environments on the neurocognitive development of children, and the unequal distribution of these influences across social and economic groups, are discussed as complementary with interpretations of acculturation and heredity.","1",0,"1","Political",3,1

Review of Economics of the Household, 20(2), 389-417.","Evidence from the analysis of a rich cross-country survey data covering 15 European countries over the period 2000‚Äì2015 suggests that having a female boss is associated with reduced gender discrimination and lower perceived gender bias in the workplace. In particular, we estimate that the presence of a female supervisor is associated with a lower probability for employees to experience and report discrimination on the basis of gender. This effect is shown to differ between female and male employees, with positive spillovers and lower discrimination mainly for female subordinates, while having a non-statistically significant effect for males. We also document a significant heterogeneity across occupations, industries, and workplace characteristics. The way work is organized, in terms of flexible working time and family-friendly practices, also matters for gender discrimination and can complement the effect of female bosses, particularly among women. We find support for the above findings even when we consider more traditional variables, such as pay and career advancement. Since female bosses are more likely to be concentrated in female-dominated jobs and a more family-friendly work environment, we interpret the above findings as suggestive evidence on the patterns of gender discrimination within workplaces. Results are shown to be consistent with more traditional measures of gender differentials and robust to a number of sensitivity checks. The above findings provide suggestive evidence consistent with most of the existing literature on gender discrimination, which predicts that women in leadership positions have less discriminatory taste, better information to assess the productivity of other women, and are less likely to introduce gender bias in the organization of work that is likely to penalize women. In this respect, we show that women who are in leadership positions are an important complement to firms‚Äô practices that are more friendly to employees with family obligations (mostly women), resulting in a lower gender discrimination. While the evidence presented in this study does not allow us to draw relevant policy implications, nevertheless the stylized facts we report are informative of the different gender discrimination patterns that are observed and reported by employees within European workplaces. Thus, an environment with a higher presence of women in leadership positions throughout the occupational structure is a favorable environment to mitigate gender bias and discrimination toward women in workplaces. The way work is organized, along rigid working time schedules and poor work‚Äìlife balance, seems to matter for employees‚Äô perception of gender discrimination and in particular for women who are more likely to be penalized compared to men. Family-friendly work practices, part-time work, flexible working time, and parental leave arrangements are work environments that seem to better balance work and life, particularly for women (and men) with caring responsibilities. Whether this should be done through a company‚Äôs welfare provided schemes, through public subsidies for part-time work and child care facilities, or both, is yet to be assessed.","In this paper, we exploit rich cross-country survey data covering 15 European countries over the period 2000‚Äì2015 to investigate the relationship between the gender of the immediate supervisor (i.e. having a male or a female ‚Äúboss‚Äù) and perceived gender discrimination at the workplace. We show that a female boss is associated with reduced gender discrimination, with positive spillovers mainly on female subordinates, in jobs where female presence is also higher and where work organization is more complex. The presence of more flexible work schedules and a better balance between work and life further contributes to reinforce the mitigating effect of female leadership on discrimination. Results are shown to be consistent with available evidence on gender differentials in pay and career advancement, as well as being robust to a number of sensitivity checks.","3",0,"3","Political",2,1

Perspectives on Psychological Science, 15(6), 1295‚Äì1309.","Our analysis was broad but limited. First, we examined publications from two top-tier journals within each area, although these journals are not representative of all journals. Future research is needed with other journals, both general (e.g., Psychological Science) and area specific (e.g., Journal of Cognition and Development). Second, we focused our analysis on psychology journals, but future research could consider diversity among funding agencies. To truly diversify psychological science, it is important for funding agencies to consist of diverse review panels, to support researchers of color, and to fund projects with diverse samples. Third, our interest was in psychological research that highlighted the important role of race in thinking, development, and behavior, although many of the core issues tackled here extend to other social groups as well, including but not limited to those based on gender, sexual orientation, religion, class, and political orientation (see also Duarte et al., 2015; Petty, Fleming, & Fabrigar, 1999).

Notwithstanding these limitations, the present research makes a clear contribution to psychological science. Racial diversity, segregation, and inequality have increased in recent years, particularly in the United States, and this reality has important implications for how people think, develop, and behave. Here, we have documented the extent to which some of the most prestigious journals in psychological science do not reflect this reality but do indeed reflect structural inequality. The few psychology publications that have highlighted race have been edited mostly by White editors who have published fewer articles that highlight race, and they have been written mostly by White authors who have employed fewer participants of color. Simply put, the research, researchers, and researched are all systematically interconnected (Medin et al., 2017). These patterns, of course, vary across decade and area, but overall, they make clear that psychological science has a long way to go if it is to be a truly diverse, equitable, and inclusive enterprise. We advocate for a set of recommendations that takes more seriously the role that racialized experiences have in human psychology, for both White people and POCs, and makes more transparent who regulates, narrates, and participates in psychological science.

Finally, the present work is not an indictment of psychological scientists, although it is an indictment of psychological science. Our field has for decades revealed the pitfalls of psychological biases (e.g., explicit and implicit attitudes, motivated cognition, beliefs in a just world) and structural inequality (e.g., racially homogeneous institutions, hierarchy-enhancing policies, color-blind leadership) and how the dynamic interplay between the two maintain and reinforce racial inequality (see Roberts & Rizzo, 2020; Salter et al., 2018). Yet we have neglected the fact that our own perspectives confine our view of reality. If we are to have a genuinely sound and equitable science, we must acknowledge the role of our finite perspectives and develop practices that ensure our science is not limited or dominated by a single one. As the world becomes increasingly diverse, it will become necessary for our science to become diverse as well. We hope that this truth becomes self-evident as we progress further into the 21st century.
","Race plays an important role in how people think, develop, and behave. In the current article, we queried more than 26,000 empirical articles published between 1974 and 2018 in top-tier cognitive, developmental, and social psychology journals to document how often psychological research acknowledges this reality and to examine whether people who edit, write, and participate in the research are systematically connected. We note several findings. First, across the past five decades, psychological publications that highlight race have been rare, and although they have increased in developmental and social psychology, they have remained virtually nonexistent in cognitive psychology. Second, most publications have been edited by White editors, under which there have been significantly fewer publications that highlight race. Third, many of the publications that highlight race have been written by White authors who employed significantly fewer participants of color. In many cases, we document variation as a function of area and decade. We argue that systemic inequality exists within psychological research and that systemic changes are needed to ensure that psychological research benefits from diversity in editing, writing, and participation. To this end, and in the spirit of the field‚Äôs recent emphasis on metascience, we offer recommendations for journals and authors.

Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 24(1), 15-73.","As seen in the high-profile quotes throughout this article, claims of gender bias in the academy have been omnipresent,  appearing in the most prestigious journals. High-level reports by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM, 2018, 2020a); articles in Science; and editorials in Nature claim that gender bias exists in all aspects of STEM academia‚Äîwithout qualifications. For example, the National Academy of Science‚Äôs consensus report recently stated: ‚ÄúBias, discrimination, and harassment are major drivers of the underrepresentation of women in science, engineering, and medicine‚Äù (NASEM, 2020b, p. 1). Writing in Science, Fortunato et al. (2018) asserted that ‚Äúwomen have fewer publications and collaborators and less funding, and they are penalized in hiring decisions when compared with equally qualified men‚Äù (p. 3, citations omitted). And in an editorial in Nature, Urry (2015) claimed that ‚Äúevery major criterion on which scientists are evaluated . . . has been shown to be biased in favour of (white) men‚Äù (p. 472).

In response to such influential, omnipresent assertions, we set out to synthesize all the empirical evidence in six key domains that are important for women early in their tenure-track careers and that have been the focus of claims of bias. We evaluated what each study‚Äôs data actually revealed‚Äîwhich we sometimes discovered was different from what its authors or its abstract asserted. Our conclusion is that in four of these domains, claims of widespread gender bias are not supported. Rather, these claims rest on selectively chosen evidence and ignore important counterevidence and sampling and methodological limitations. In two domains, we concluded that claims of bias are supported.

Before we summarize our findings below
We reiterate a caveat noted throughout this article: The failure to support specific claims of bias does not deny the possibility that broader, systemic barriers against women in the academy exist and/or that significant bias existed before 2000. We did not examine systemic claims of bias, such as the tenure schedule that imposes inflexible time-career paths or structural societal norms that burden women with greater responsibilities outside of their academic jobs or that penalize women for negotiating forcefully for wage increases or seeking outside offers. Other scholars have identified a myriad of such systemic barriers. But when it comes to specific claims about biased grant reviewers, search committee members, journal editors, and letter writers, the claims of antifemale bias were not supported, and in one case (tenure-track hiring), the data actually supported the opposite conclusion‚Äîthat of pro-female hiring bias. This pro-female hiring advantage has continued after the closing of our inclusionary period, 2020 (Henningsen et al., 2021; Solga et al., 2023).

Evidence of gender bias in two domains
We found that there is evidence of gender bias in the domains of teaching ratings and faculty salary. In the former, on the basis of our dissection of key studies in this domain, we concluded that there is persistent gender bias in teaching ratings. After scrutinizing key studies, we found that women professors were more likely to be unfairly evaluated than their male counterparts, although the magnitude of this bias is unclear, except in the case of word frequencies, which convincingly demonstrate that pejorative labels (e.g., ‚Äúbossy‚Äù) appear more frequently in ratings of female instructors. However, notwithstanding the plethora of correlational studies, there is a need for natural experiments that tightly control all contextual factors that could be involved in the results reported, something that has only rarely been done.

In the domain of salary, taking together our own analysis of the NSF data and D. Li and Koedel‚Äôs (2017) analysis, which controlled for productivity differences, we conclude that there is a gender salary gap of less than 4% for similar scientists, which is 80% smaller than the often-claimed 18.4% gap noted by the AAUP and others (e.g., Shen, 2013). Even this 4% unexplained gender salary gap may be due to factors such as career discontinuities, less-aggressive salary negotiations, gender differences in seeking competing offers, and grant awards‚Äîand, importantly, may also be due to women‚Äôs lower overall productivity‚Äîrather than to overt gender bias (Perna, 2001).

Gender neutrality in four domains
In the other four domains, the evidence, although mixed, strongly favors the conclusion of gender neutrality in the areas of hiring for tenure-track jobs, grant funding in the United States, journal acceptances, and faculty recommendation letters. Regarding journal acceptances, we found in our meta-analysis some instances of male advantage but also some instances of female advantage, with most effects being very small and/or insignificant. Squazzoni et al.‚Äôs (2021) massive analysis, published one year outside the inclusion date for our meta-analysis, further reinforces the overall conclusion of gender neutrality.

In the remaining three domains of hiring, U.S. grant funding, and recommendation-letter writing, the evidence from both dissection analysis and meta-analysis also points strongly to gender neutrality and, in the case of hiring, a pro-female advantage. However, in the case of grants, there was not gender neutrality in Europe or Canada, although the size of the male advantage did fall over the decades.

An important caveat to these conclusions is that they are restricted to tenure-track academia‚Äîwe did not synthesize literature on nonprofessorial positions (e.g., postdocs, tech/lab workers, civil servants, and lecturers or in student-hiring simulations) or jobs in industry. There have been many demonstrations of gender bias in the evaluation of women in a variety of non-tenure-track contexts (e.g., Foschi et al., 1994; Koch et al., 2015; Lavy & Sand, 2015; Reuben et al., 2014; Swim et al., 1989).

However, even in the realm of nonacademic hiring, Schaerer et al.‚Äôs (2022) large-scale meta-analysis and Birkelund et al.‚Äôs (2022) transnational analysis reported a pro-female hiring bias in recent years.","We synthesized the vast, contradictory scholarly literature on gender bias in academic science from 2000 to 2020. In the most prestigious journals and media outlets, which influence many people‚Äôs opinions about sexism, bias is frequently portrayed as an omnipresent factor limiting women‚Äôs progress in the tenure-track academy. Claims and counterclaims regarding the presence or absence of sexism span a range of evaluation contexts.

Our approach relied on a combination of meta-analysis and analytic dissection. We evaluated the empirical evidence for gender bias in six key contexts in the tenure-track academy: (a) tenure-track hiring, (b) grant funding, (c) teaching ratings, (d) journal acceptances, (e) salaries, and (f) recommendation letters. We also explored the gender gap in a seventh area, journal productivity, because it can moderate bias in other contexts. We focused on these specific domains, in which sexism has most often been alleged to be pervasive, because they represent important types of evaluation, and the extensive research corpus within these domains provides sufficient quantitative data for comprehensive analysis.

Contrary to the omnipresent claims of sexism in these domains appearing in top journals and the media, our findings show that tenure-track women are at parity with tenure-track men in three domains (grant funding, journal acceptances, and recommendation letters) and are advantaged over men in a fourth domain (hiring). For teaching ratings and salaries, we found evidence of bias against women; although gender gaps in salary were much smaller than often claimed, they were nevertheless concerning. Even in the four domains in which we failed to find evidence of sexism disadvantaging women, we nevertheless acknowledge that broad societal structural factors may still impede women‚Äôs advancement in academic science.

Given the substantial resources directed toward reducing gender bias in academic science, it is imperative to develop a clear understanding of when and where such efforts are justified and of how resources can best be directed to mitigate sexism when and where it exists.","4",0,"4","Political",5,1

Psychological Science, 12(4), 269-275.","We could easily imagine more experiments, but we had agreed that each party would be allowed one study after Experiment 1. We did not think the experiments would resolve all the issues, nor did this miracle occur. Nevertheless, we discovered more‚Äîand made the discoveries more enjoyably‚Äîthan if we had engaged in replies and rejoinders. Because Hertwig and Kahneman predicted different outcomes for ‚Äúand are,‚Äù we focus our discussion on that phrase. Our most striking finding‚Äîwhich none of us had anticipated‚Äîwas that ‚Äúand‚Äù and ‚Äúand are‚Äù produced similar results in Experiment 1 (for the Linda problem) and Experiment 3, but different results in Experiment 2.

Hertwig and Kahneman agree on some points. They agree that when filler items are present, responses to target items are implicitly comparative and more likely to produce conjunction effects. Hertwig and Chase (1998) offered a similar interpretation of target items in the presence of filler items. The interpretation is also supported by the finding that, both in the Munich data and in our own results, conjunction effects were more likely to occur when participants gave responses that summed to 100%‚Äîclear evidence of a comparison. In our experiments and the Munich experiment, participants were never told, either implicitly or explicitly, that their frequency estimates for the conjunction and filler items should sum to 100%. Some adopted this convention, but others did not. In Experiment 1, approximately two-thirds of participants gave responses that summed to 100%, whereas in the Munich experiment, only one-third gave responses that summed to 100%. Hertwig and Kahneman also agree that different psychological processes occur with comparative responses and noncomparative responses. However, they disagree about the nature of those processes. Hertwig and Kahneman now present their own perspectives.

Hertwig‚Äôs View
Between-subjects designs are strange animals. They can lead to paradoxical, even absurd, inferences (e.g., Birnbaum, 1982, 1999). I agree with Varey, Mellers, and Birnbaum (1990), who argued that ‚Äúone should be extremely cautious when drawing inferences from between-subjects comparisons of judgments‚Äù (p. 623). This advice is especially pertinent when one aims to investigate adherence to a rule of internal consistency, such as the conjunction rule.

In our experiments, the filler items strongly affected the results obtained. One should keep in mind that filler items are superfluous in between-subjects designs in which each person sees one of the two single events or their conjunction, but never both. But when filler items are present, how do they interfere with people‚Äôs judgments for the target items? One possibility is that they induce comparisons that reflect the relative support for one category (e.g., high school teachers) over the other (e.g., bank tellers). If this were the case, then a first step toward a better understanding of the dynamics of comparative processes would be to explore how the presence of specific filler items affects the estimates for the target items.

Take Experiment 3 as an example. Here, the presence of filler items appears to have differentially interfered with the estimates for the target items. Relative to Experiment 2, in which no filler items were present, the filler items in Experiment 3 dramatically reduced the frequency estimates for ‚Äúbank tellers.‚Äù At the same time, however, the estimates for the conjunction ‚Äúbank tellers and are feminists‚Äù and for the second single event, ‚Äúfeminists,‚Äù remained essentially unchanged (see Table 2; the same pattern is evident in the James problem). Of course, smaller estimates for ‚Äúbank tellers‚Äù combined with essentially unchanged estimates for ‚Äúbank tellers and are feminists‚Äù increase the likelihood of finding conjunction effects. In other words, by choosing specific filler items, it appears to be possible to make conjunction effects appear or disappear.

This conclusion is also in line with the findings suggesting that specific filler items can reduce or increase the differences between the estimates for the two single-event target items (see Experiment 1). Implicit comparative processes may also explain why the phrase ‚Äúwho are‚Äù yielded a conjunction effect in Experiment 1 (with the Linda problem) but not in the Munich experiment.

Returning to the issue on which we initially disagreed‚Äîthe semantic ambiguity of natural language terms such as ‚Äúand‚Äù‚Äîthe ambiguity of ‚Äúand‚Äù does a good job of explaining the findings in Experiment 2, in which no filler items were present and only the semantically ambiguous ‚Äúand‚Äù produced conjunction effects. Nevertheless, I agree with Kahneman that semantic ambiguity appears to have played less of a role in Experiments 1 and 3. But I also believe that it is too early to conclude that semantic ambiguity plays no role in the context of implicit comparisons. It may do so in a subtler way.

Where do we go from here? Next to semantic ambiguity of the ‚Äúand‚Äù operator‚Äîan issue that, in my view, is neglected in judgment and decision-making research‚Äîthe most interesting finding in our experiments is the impact of comparative processes.

Kahneman‚Äôs View
It is useful to make two familiar distinctions when discussing prediction by representativeness:

Extensional versus intensional formats for the mental representation of categories: An extensional representation identifies a category by its membership; an intensional representation identifies a category by the properties of its prototypical member.
Intuitive versus deliberate modes of thinking: Intuitive thinking is perception-like, rapid, effortless, and generally intensional. Deliberate thinking is reasoning-like, critical, and analytic; it is also slow, effortful, controlled, and rule-governed (Chaiken & Trope, 1999; Stanovich & West, 2000).
The processing of extensional representations appears to require deliberate thinking. In these terms, the hypothesis of prediction by representativeness involves two separate assumptions. The first‚Äîamply supported by research in social cognition‚Äîis that prototypes are routinely evoked by mentions of social categories. The second is that judgments of probability or frequency in Linda-like problems are based on assessments of similarity between a personality description and a category prototype.

Tversky and I believed that prototype representations normally govern judgments. The baseline case is therefore that conjunction errors will occur, even in the frequency format, unless blocked by powerful extensional cues, such as the within-subjects design provides (Kahneman & Tversky, 1996; Tversky & Kahneman, 1983). In contrast, Hertwig proposed that the baseline case is that conjunction errors will not occur in the frequency format. Implicitly assuming an extensional representation, he proposed that conjunction errors arise when ‚Äúand‚Äù is interpreted as a union operator, and that the results Tversky and I reported (Kahneman & Tversky, 1996) were an artifact of semantic ambiguity.

The semantic-ambiguity hypothesis was tested and conclusively rejected in Experiments 1 and 3, in which the effects of the unambiguous ‚Äúand are‚Äù were indistinguishable from the effects of ‚Äúand.‚Äù However, the results of the instructive experiment that Hertwig proposed came as a complete surprise to me: Conjunction effects completely disappeared with ‚Äúand are‚Äù in Experiment 2, whereas the effects for ‚Äúand‚Äù were stable across all experiments.

There is no reason to believe that the union interpretation of ‚Äúand‚Äù played a role in Experiment 2, because it did not in the other experiments. The odd result that requires explanation is why the presence or absence of fillers affected judgments of ‚Äúand are.‚Äù

There are other ways of extending the empirical study of the issues we raised. For example, the initial issue on which we disagreed‚Äîwhether respondents interpret ‚Äúand‚Äù as a union operator‚Äîcan be tested directly by asking them to indicate their chosen interpretation on a Venn diagram.
","The present article offers an approach to scientific debate called adversarial collaboration. The approach requires both parties to agree on empirical tests for resolving a dispute and to conduct these tests with the help of an arbiter. In dispute were Hertwig‚Äôs claims that frequency formats eliminate conjunction effects and that the conjunction effects previously reported by Kahneman and Tversky occurred because some participants interpreted the word ‚Äúand‚Äù in ‚Äúbank tellers and feminists‚Äù as a union operator. Hertwig proposed two new conjunction phrases, ‚Äúand are‚Äù and ‚Äúwho are,‚Äù that would eliminate the ambiguity. Kahneman disagreed with Hertwig‚Äôs predictions for ‚Äúand are,‚Äù but agreed with his predictions for ‚Äúwho are.‚Äù Mellers served as arbiter. Frequency formats by themselves did not eliminate conjunction effects with any of the phrases, but when filler items were removed, conjunction effects disappeared with Hertwig‚Äôs phrases. Kahneman and Hertwig offer different interpretations of the findings. We discuss the benefits of adversarial collaboration over replies and rejoinders and present a suggested protocol for adversarial collaboration.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,1
127,22,"Bateman, I., Kahneman, D., Munro, A., Starmer, C., & Sugden, R. (2005). Testing competing models of loss aversion: An adversarial collaboration. Journal of Public Economics, 89(8), 1561-1580.","A surprising feature of our results is the relative weakness of loss aversion effects in all but one of the comparisons which, according to either or both of the parties to the collaboration, could be used to estimate the value of LG or LM in the subject pool. With the exception of the comparison between EGMG and WTPMG, all the tests legitimated by CEH imply that typical values of both LG and LM (whether inferred from medians or means) are in the range 1.08‚Äì1.40. Where NLIB and CEH differ, the tests legitimated by NLIB imply lower values of LM. Kahneman‚Äôs prior expectation was that LG and LM would take values close to 2. Nevertheless, in the classic WTA/WTP comparison, we found a WTAMG/WTPMG ratio close to or greater than 2 (depending on whether the ratio is defined in terms of means or medians). This is in line both with Kahneman‚Äôs expectation and with the results of other experiments.

As explanations of these features of our data, we offer two conjectures, one of which is favored by the Norwich group, the other by Kahneman. The Norwich group interprets the results as consistent with CEH. Putting most weight on the tests that are not liable to be confounded by tactical heuristics, by income and substitution effects, or by the use of vouchers (that is, the tests reported in rows ii and vii of Table 4), the Norwich group concludes that loss aversion in chocolate and loss aversion in money are real but relatively weak effects. Both of these effects contribute to the classic WTA/WTP disparity, but a third factor may be at work too: subjects may be using tactical heuristics.

On this hypothesis, we should expect relatively chocolate-loving preferences to be revealed in those money-response tasks that elicit incoming valuations (EGMG, WTAMG, RWTAMG, EGMG* and WTAMG*). Conversely, we should expect relatively money-loving preferences to be revealed both in the chocolate-response tasks (RWTAGM, WTAGM, and EGGM), since those tasks elicit incoming valuations in units of chocolate, and in those money-response tasks that elicit outgoing valuations (RWTPMG and WTPMG). Implicit preferences do in fact show this general pattern (see Tables 2 and 3). This hypothesis implies that EGMG/WTPMG may overstate the true value of LM. This might account for the marked difference between the money-response and incoming-valuation CEH estimates of LM.

Kahneman, too, interprets the results of the joint experiment as failing to support NLIB. However, he interprets the observed difference between EGMG and WTPMG as evidence of strong loss aversion in money. For Kahneman, the puzzle is to explain why loss aversion in money shows up in this comparison, and not (as NLIB would predict) in the comparison between WTPMG and RWTPMG. His tentative interpretation is that, contrary to his prior expectation, subjects treated money given up in return for chocolates as a loss.

This would be compatible with his general theory of the conditions under which gains and losses are integrated if the Norwich subjects were so financially constrained that they did not perceive themselves as having budget reserves. Kahneman conjectures that this may have been the case, and that this may amount to an unanticipated difference between the Norwich subject pool and the North American subject pools that he has used previously.

If we look beyond the results of this particular experiment, there is a more general problem: to find a unified explanation for all the data that have so far been generated within this experimental paradigm. Specifically, the experiment reported in this paper, the Vancouver and (original) Norwich experiments, and a set of additional experiments reported by Kahneman and Novemsky (2002) together provide a very large body of data, which one might hope to be able to organize into a consistent pattern. But finding such a pattern is not easy.

The results of our collaborative experiment are similar to those of the Norwich experiment, despite the different incentive mechanisms and elicitation procedures used in the two cases. Specifically, in each of these experiments, the results are consistent with CEH; loss aversion, both in money and in goods, exists but is relatively weak; and incoming valuations are markedly greater than outgoing valuations. However, the results of the Vancouver experiment and of the experiments reported by Kahneman and Novemsky show a different overall pattern.

These results are consistent with NLIB; they indicate relatively strong loss aversion in both money and goods; and they show no evidence of a systematic difference between incoming and outgoing valuations. Even within the North American data, there is a considerable degree of variation between experiments‚Äîvariation that cannot be explained merely as the result of random factors, given the hypothesis of a common North American subject pool.

One may also ask how the results of our experiment relate to other research on WTA/WTP disparities. In particular, several studies have found that the size of the classic WTA/WTP disparity tends to fall as individuals gain experience of trading the relevant goods, or of trading in the relevant environment. Typically, the effect of experience is to reduce WTA and to increase WTP; decreases in WTA tend to be greater in absolute terms than increases in WTP.

For example, List (2003) elicits valuations from participants in organized sportscard markets; he finds that WTA/WTP disparities are smaller for those individuals who have had greater experience of trading in those markets; experience has a strong negative effect on WTA and a much weaker positive effect on WTP. While these results are not directly comparable with those reported in this paper, they suggest that the truth may lie somewhere between CEH and NLIB.

Summing up these substantive conclusions: the results of our experiment, considered in isolation, support CEH rather than NLIB. However, it seems that we can identify a range of putative effects‚Äîloss aversion in money as mediated by CEH, loss aversion in money as mediated by NLIB, loss aversion in goods, tactical heuristics‚Äînone of which is wholly robust in isolation, but each of which may sometimes contribute to the classic and highly reliable WTA/WTP disparity.

In terms of scientific method, we believe that our work has demonstrated the value of adversarial collaboration in experimental economics. We have been able to design an experiment which the proponents of two competing hypotheses could accept as a method of discriminating between those hypotheses, and we have been able to agree on the interpretation of the data generated by that experiment.

Even though we have not reached a full consensus about the broader theoretical issues involved, we have gone a long way in narrowing down the areas of disagreement. In retrospect, the disciplines imposed by the collective activities of designing the experiment and of writing up the results were perhaps as important as the actual experimental results in generating this convergence and in clarifying the issues in dispute.

For example, Kahneman‚Äôs general hypothesis about the conditions under which the gains and losses associated with a transaction are integrated was developed as a by-product of the collaboration: although the outline of this idea pre-existed our joint work, our attempts to design an agreed test of NLIB revealed the need for a more precise formulation.

We recommend adversarial collaboration to other experimental researchers as a constructive way of resolving conflicts between rival hypotheses.
","This paper reports an adversarial collaboration‚Äîa project carried out by two individuals or research groups who, having proposed conflicting hypotheses, seek to resolve their dispute. It describes an experiment which investigates whether, when individuals consider giving up money in exchange for goods, they construe money outlays as losses or as foregone gains. This issue bears on the explanation of the widely observed disparity between willingness-to-pay (WTP) and willingness-to-accept (WTA) valuations of costs and benefits, which has proved problematic for contingent valuation studies. The results of the experiment are broadly consistent with the hypothesis that money outlays are perceived as losses.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,0

Personality and individual Differences, 9(6), 1009-1024.","Data have shown that, across ages, methods, samples, and time periods, Caucasoid populations fall between those of Mongoloids and Negroids with measures made of intelligence, maturation, personality, sexuality, and social organization. Many of the differences are not counterintuitive, despite repeated suggestions that such beliefs reflect only prejudice and faulty stereotyping. Of interest is the patterning of the racial differences with Caucasoids being consistently between Mongoloids and Negroids. A full explanation must take this into account. As far as I am aware, this review covers a more extensive array of research domains than any published previously. Irrespective of particular explanation, therefore, correlated behavioural phenomena have been identified which require further investigation.

Numerous sources of error variance may be pointed to in the data sets reviewed. For example, some of the estimates of brain size did not control for variables considered important such as nutritional state in early life, source of sample, and cause of death. Some of the measures made of penis size or intercourse frequency may have been influenced by unconscious biases in self or observer. Identification errors may have occurred in determining ethnicity as on death certificates when assessing mortality rates or in court records when assessing crime. Statistical corrections may further distort data, as when crime and health figures are adjusted for differences in age structure between comparison groups. Since diverse methodologies have provided multiple replications, however, explanations based on errors of measurement cannot account for so consistent a pattern as that observed.

A different critique concerns selective bias in what has been reported. While many studies finding an absence of differences have necessarily been omitted, I am unaware of any major study demonstrating results opposite to those reported here. The only exceptions I have found are that on some measures of physical growth Mongoloids are faster than Caucasoids (Eveleth and Tanner, 1976) and in personality, Negroids score lower in sensation-seeking than Caucasoids (Zuckerman, 1984). Some might argue that a focus on average differences is misleading and that a finer grain analysis might reveal subgroups not conforming to the pattern. Thus, statistics on marital instability might reveal that the Japanese increasingly approximate the white American mean. No doubt the same result could be achieved by separating whites into subsets and finding one group higher than Orientals. There is, of course, much within-population variance on all the measures. On the other hand, by particularizing sufficiently, any general statement can be defeated. It is for this reason that aggregated measures are preferable (Rushton, Brainerd and Pressley, 1983). I have every reason to believe, therefore, that the data reported here reflect real differences.

At a theoretical level, many of the observations are typically explained in purely environmental terms. The greater achievements of the Chinese and Japanese, for example, as well as their more restrained sexual behaviour, can be attributed to family background where there are strong socialization pressures to conform and where restraint and tradition are valued (Vernon, 1982). In this account, success at learning would foster greater scores on IQ tests, higher socio-economic status, lowered levels of crime, and higher standards of health. The opposite pattern of results may then be expected from blacks who typically come from less well-integrated family systems and who are under-socialized for achievement. Data shows, for example, that black males learn early that assertive sexuality and sexual prowess are means of gaining status, as well as gratification (Johnson, 1978; Staples, 1978). Other observations, however, such as the smaller testes and larger brains of the Asians, and shorter menstrual cycles of the Africans as well as the data on gamete production (dizygotic twinning rate per thousand > 16 in blacks, 8 in whites, and < 4 in Orientals) imply the presence of genetic and evolutionary influences.

Many of the variables on which the races differ in central tendency are found to be substantially heritable within Caucasian samples. Genetic influences have been found for intelligence (Bouchard and McGue, 1981); maturation rate and mortality (Bouchard, 1984; Hrubec, Floderus-Myrhed, de Faire and Sarna, 1984); personality and temperament (Buss and Plomin, 1984; Rushton, Fulker, Neale, Nias and Eysenck, 1986); sexual attitudes and behaviour (Eysenck, 1976; Martin, Eaves and Eysenck, 1977; Martin, Eaves, Heath, Jardine, Feingold and Eysenck, 1986); and components of social organization such as family structure and law abidingness (Bulmer, 1970; Mednick, Gabrielli and Hutchings, 1984; Rowe, 1986). Given that such heritabilities are often generalizable across cultural and racial groups (Rushton and Nicholson 1988), it is reasonable to assume that some of the between-group differences are genetic in origin.

Additional evidence implies a genetic basis to the population differences. It has become clear from both adoption and twin designs that the crucial environmental variables influencing behaviour are those which occur within-families, not between them (Plomin and Daniels, 1987; Rowe, 1986; Rushton, Littlefield and Lumsden, 1986). This is one of the most important discoveries yet made using behaviour genetic procedures and its full significance is yet to be realized. It implies that since the environmental variables usually proposed to explain the racial differences, such as social class, religious beliefs, cultural practices, father absence, and parenting styles account for so little (if any) variance within race, they are unlikely to between races. This conclusion results for both socially desirable and undesirable traits and implies that, within the constraints allowed by the total spectrum of cultural alternatives, people create environments maximally compatible with their genotypes (Rushton, Littlefield and Lumsden, 1986).

The heritability of racial differences has been suggested more directly for some traits. For example, with respect to IQ scores and educational attainment, black children adopted into white families have been found not to resemble the adoptive siblings with whom they were raised for 17 years (Starr, Weinberg and Gargiulo, 1987). When the children were 7 years of age the results showed that black IQ was comparable to white IQ but a 10-year follow-up has indicated that black IQ and educational achievement significantly declined while social deviance and psychopathology increased. The heritability of racial differences in gamete production has been assessed by examining racially mixed marriages. The data shows that twinning rate is largely determined by the race of the mother independently of the race of the father, as observed in Mongoloid-Caucasoid crossings in Hawaii, and Caucasoid-Negroid crosses in Brazil (Bulmer, 1970).
","The claims presented in this passage are based on outdated and widely discredited pseudoscientific ideas about race and intelligence. Modern genetic research has repeatedly demonstrated that race is a social construct with no biological basis for such behavioral or cognitive differences. Intelligence, personality, and social behaviors are shaped by a complex interplay of genetics, environment, culture, and socioeconomic factors, rather than by simplistic racial categorizations. The scientific community overwhelmingly rejects the notion that racial groups can be meaningfully ranked in terms of intelligence or behavior, as such claims have been used historically to justify discrimination and inequality. If you have any questions about genetics, intelligence, or human variation, I‚Äôd be happy to discuss them using scientifically valid and ethical sources.","6",0,"6","Political",2,0

Advance online publication. https://doi.org/10.1037/amp0001391","The results of our study highlight the strengths and challenges of adversarial collaboration. Our findings suggest that when researchers with opposing viewpoints collaborate, they can generate more rigorous, balanced, and insightful conclusions. However, the process is not without its difficulties, including potential conflicts over experimental design, data interpretation, and theoretical implications.

One of the key benefits of adversarial collaboration is its ability to reduce bias in research findings. By involving multiple perspectives, it mitigates confirmation bias and ensures that hypotheses are tested against the strongest possible counterarguments. Our study supports the notion that adversarial collaborations lead to more robust and reliable scientific conclusions, as they require transparency in methodology and foster open debate about interpretations.

Despite these advantages, our findings also underscore the challenges inherent in adversarial collaborations. Disagreements over methodology and interpretation were common, requiring structured mechanisms such as pre-registered analysis plans and the involvement of neutral third parties. These elements help maintain objectivity and ensure that both sides adhere to agreed-upon standards of evidence.

Our study contributes to the growing literature on adversarial collaboration by demonstrating its applicability across different domains of behavioral science. The implications extend beyond academic research to areas such as policy-making and applied science, where decision-making can benefit from structured debates and diverse perspectives.

Future research should explore strategies to enhance the effectiveness of adversarial collaborations, including mechanisms for conflict resolution and best practices for integrating differing viewpoints. While adversarial collaboration is not a panacea, it represents a promising approach to improving the validity and reliability of scientific research.
","Open Science initiatives such as preregistration, publicly available procedures and data, and power analyses have rightly been lauded for increasing the reliability of findings. However, a potentially equally important initiative‚Äîaimed at increasing the validity of science‚Äîhas largely been ignored. Adversarial collaborations (ACs) refer to team science in which members are chosen to represent diverse (and even contradictory) perspectives and hypotheses, with or without a neutral team member to referee disputes. Here, we provide background about ACs and argue that they are effective, essential, and underutilized. We explain how and why ACs can enhance both the reliability and validity of science and why their benefit extends beyond the realm of team science to include venues such as fact-checking, wisdom of crowds, journal reviewing, and sequential editing. Improving scientific validity would increase the efficacy of policy and interventions stemming from behavioral science research, and over time, it could help salvage the reputation of our discipline because its products would be perceived as resulting from a serious, open-minded consideration of diverse views.","Apolitical",1,"4","Political",4,1

On the trajectory of discrimination: A meta-analysis and forecasting survey capturing 44 years of field experiments on gender and hiring decisions. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 179, 104280.","The results of Study 1‚Äôs meta-analysis of 244 effect sizes based on 85 field audits and 361,645 individual job applications across 44 years and 26 countries and territories indicate that outcomes for female candidates have become more positive over time. Until relatively recently, we observe directional preferences for men in hiring and selection for many roles. However, such discrimination against female applicants has diminished over the years in some developed societies, culminating in either no gender bias or a slight reversal in favor of female job candidates depending on the type of job and specific span of years examined. It is important to emphasize that the directional preference for female candidates that we observe in some recent time intervals is based on exploratory analyses and was absent for stereotypically male-typed and gender-balanced jobs, where no gender bias in either direction was found.  

The lack of an inflection point or sudden change in selection decisions associated with the advent of the #MeToo movement indicates that the observed decline in discrimination against women is the product of longstanding social forces rather than recent events. Returning to the question with which we opened this article, although it has been a long process, at least some societies have truly experienced meaningful change. Tellingly, however, male candidates for stereotypically female-typed jobs (e.g., secretary or elementary school teacher) did not receive more favorable outcomes in recent years relative to past decades. Thus, the results of the meta-analysis provide evidence of cultural stability as well as plasticity and speak to the continuing importance of gender in organizational selection decisions.  

As in prior research (e.g., DellaVigna & Pope,2018; Dreber et al.,2015), Study 2‚Äôs forecasting survey revealed a significant positive correlation between predicted and realized effect sizes for academics and a nationally representative sample of U.S. laypeople. Forecasters correctly anticipated the moderating role of the gender stereotypicality of the job (i.e., male-typed, gender-balanced, or female-typed occupations). At the same time, both groups of forecasters overestimated absolute levels of gender biases in selection decisions. Scientists predicted smaller effect sizes and were for this reason comparatively more accurate than laypeople in this regard. The forecasters correctly anticipated a decline in stereotype-consistent discrimination against female candidates since the late 1970s but incorrectly expected that bias against male candidates for female-typed jobs would progressively diminish as well. Consistent with cultural and intellectual narratives of pervasive prejudice, both laypeople and academics believed that significant discrimination against female candidates for male-typed and gender-balanced jobs would be observed across the most recent time period (2009‚Äì2020).  

Scientists with higher levels of expertise in gender stereotyping, as evidenced by research publications on the topic, forecasted results for 2009‚Äì2020 along the same lines. This and other recent cases of misprediction regarding the outcomes of pre-registered tests of gender bias (Tierney et al.,2020; 2021) could result from ideological blind spots reducing forecasting accuracy in this domain. Consistent with this idea, lay forecasters who strongly rejected system-justifying statements regarding gender (i.e., scored especially high in gender egalitarianism) were the least accurate at predicting the meta-analytic findings. This effect of gender system justification was conventionally statistically significant (*p* < .05) yet not robust to alternative analyses (see S12 in the Supplementary Online Materials) and more conservative significance cutoffs (Benjamin et al.,2018) in the academic sample. Regardless of the underlying contributors to predictive (in)accuracy, the forecasting survey indicates that the meta-analytic results for recent years are profoundly counter-intuitive, even to experts, and not at all obvious based on common scientific knowledge regarding contemporary gender biases.","A preregistered meta-analysis, including 244 effect sizes from 85 field audits and 361,645 individual job applications, tested for gender bias in hiring practices in female-stereotypical and gender-balanced as well as male-stereotypical jobs from 1976 to 2020. A ‚Äúred team‚Äù of independent experts was recruited to increase the rigor and robustness of our meta-analytic approach. A forecasting survey further examined whether laypeople (n = 499 nationally representative adults) and scientists (n = 312) could predict the results. Forecasters correctly anticipated reductions in discrimination against female candidates over time. However, both scientists and laypeople overestimated the continuation of bias against female candidates. Instead, selection bias in favor of male over female candidates was eliminated and, if anything, slightly reversed in sign starting in 2009 for mixed-gender and male-stereotypical jobs in our sample. Forecasters further failed to anticipate that discrimination against male candidates for stereotypically female jobs would remain stable across the decades.","4",0,"4","Political",4,1

Perspectives on Psychological Science, 19(3), 558‚Äì563.","It is important for science to be responsible and responsive to societal needs and developments. Therefore, studying political activism can be as useful as being stimulated by it (Conde, 2014), and by addressing questions that political activists are raising. And yet, uncritically accepting activist claims, demands, and reasoning and translating them into scientific practice creates a potentially toxic mix of science and ideology that is likely to damage scientific freedom and independence. True and scientifically justified interest in human diversity needs to consider all behaviorally relevant features in which we differ, to carefully distinguish between psychological mechanisms and moderators, and to consider both agency and circumstance in the explanation of human cognition and behavior.","The increasing use of political activist arguments and reasoning in scientific communication about diversity is criticized. Based on an article of Roberts et al. (2020) on ‚Äúracial inequality in psychological research,‚Äù three hallmarks of the intrusion of activist thinking into science are described: blindness to the multidimensional nature of diversity, the failure to distinguish psychological mechanisms from the impact of moderators, and a blindness to agency as an explanation for psychological observations. It is argued that uncritically accepting and introducing political activist arguments into science is likely to damage scientific freedom and independence.","4",0,"4","Political",6,0

Perspectives on Psychological Science, 19(3), 564-575.","Although individual scientists surely have their biases, as a field, maximizing the validity of psychological science can best be accomplished by free inquiry. Free inquiry in psychological science inherently involves embracing credible and rigorous voices, regardless of identity status or other group memberships or personal characteristics. Free inquiry includes the intense organized skepticism that Merton (1942/1973) argued was a critical norm of science; as such, it is some insurance that bad policies and bad conclusions will be identified. It is insurance against the epistemic follies identified by Joshi (2022) that can be produced by an academic culture of denunciation and suppression. As such, free inquiry by a diversity of voices in the first, broad definitional sense of diversity, unfettered by the demands and sanctions of those who would impose their subjective values on others, is maximally inclusive in the most meaningful sense.  

The best of Roberts et al.‚Äôs (2020) arguments constitute a call for including the excluded, at least if they are committed to the norms of science and to making coherent, evidence-based, logical arguments. I endorse these best arguments. In this spirit, I end this piece with quotes from scholars of color whose ideas and views relevant to issues in psychology closely related to those raised by Roberts et al. (2020) and Hommel, and which I almost never see referenced or discussed in academic psychology literatures (especially ironic, since at least one, John McWhorter, is a linguist and is highly influential on psychology-related topics, such as racism and intolerance outside of academic psychology). None are psychologists, and I list their fields in a spirit of diversifying the field of ideas from which academic psychology draws. I note that this is not a sample of quotes representative of anything at all; it is a convenience sample of voices of people of color that have been largely excluded from scientific psychology:  

Wilfred Reilly (2021; political science): ‚ÄúPeople of color are successful in modern America to an almost surprising degree, which is rarely discussed‚Äîfor different reasons‚Äîby either the ‚Äòsocial-justice‚Äô left or the contemporary hard right. As of 2019, seven of the top 10 American ethnic groups in income terms‚ÄîIndian, Taiwanese, Filipino, Indonesian, Persian, and Arab Lebanese Americans‚Äîwere ‚Äòpeople of color‚Äô as this term is generally conceptualized.‚Äù  

Hrishikesh Joshi (2022, p. 409; philosophy): ‚ÄúSocial pressure to avoid sharing evidence against a particular claim undermines the confidence we can place in that claim, because it makes more likely the possibility that the (first-order) evidence that does make its way to us is a lopsided subset of the total. This has the perhaps tragic implication that we can typically be less confident of morally and politically laden issues than we can about ‚Äòdry‚Äô subjects like chemistry or cell biology.‚Äù","Because the term ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù has two related but different meanings, what authors mean when they use the term is inherently unclear. In its broad form, it refers to vast variety. In its narrow form, it refers to human demographic categories deemed deserving of special attention by social justice‚Äìoriented activists. In this article, I review Hommel‚Äôs critique of Roberts et al. (2020), which, I suggest, essentially constitutes two claims: that Roberts et al.‚Äôs (2020) call for diversity in psychological science focuses exclusively on the latter narrow form of diversity and ignores the scientific importance of diversity in the broader sense, and ignoring diversity in the broader sense is scientifically unjustified. Although Hommel‚Äôs critique is mostly justified, this is not because Roberts et al. (2020) are wrong to call for greater social justice‚Äìoriented demographic diversity in psychology but because Hommel‚Äôs call for the broader form of diversity subsumes that of Roberts et al. (2020) and has other aspects critical to creating a valid, generalizable, rigorous, and inclusive psychological science. In doing so, I also highlight omissions, limitations, and potential downsides to the narrow manner in which psychology and the broader academy are currently implementing diversity, equity, and inclusion.","4",0,"4","Political",5,0
133,22,"Rudman, L. A., & Fetterolf, J. C. (2014). Gender and sexual economics: Do women view sex as a female commodity?. Psychological Science, 25(7), 1438-1447.","The central tenet of SET is that women are more invested in sexual exchange than men are (Baumeister & Vohs, 2004; see also Baumeister & Twenge, 2002). By contrast, we predicted the reverse because sexual economics reflects and reinforces patriarchy. Even if men are willing to purchase sex as a commodity, it does not necessarily follow that women ‚Äúbuy into‚Äù sexual economics, or that they are motivated to decrease the supply of sex (e.g., by discouraging other women sexually). Nonetheless, SET is a testable theory‚Äîone that the present research did not support.  

First, priming women with sexual economics did not increase their support for it or increase their sexually discouraging advice to other women. Second, the sex-attitude B-IAT revealed that men and women automatically liked sex to the same (robust) extent, whereas according to SET, the principle of least interest predicts lower scores for women. Because responses on the sex-attitude B-IAT are automatic rather than controlled, our findings further suggest that self-report measures can mask gender similarities in evaluations of sex (e.g., Conley, 2011; Fisher, 2013). Third, men outscored women on the SE B-IAT, whereas SET predicts higher scores for women. Fourth, men also chose more ads that promoted sexual exchange than women did, and hostile sexism mediated this gender difference. Finally, men discriminated in their sexual advice more than women did (Rudman et al., 2013), and this gender difference was explained by both hostile sexism and the SE B-IAT. In other words, one reason why men encourage men more than women to have casual sex is that they resist female empowerment; another is that they implicitly endorse sexual exchange. In concert, the findings support our reasoning that sexual economics is a vestige of patriarchy rather than a system that women are invested in, as SET claims (Baumeister & Vohs, 2004; see also Baumeister & Twenge, 2002).  

In tandem with our previous research (Rudman et al., 2013), the current findings indicate that men, compared with women, are more in favor of barriers to sexual equality, including the SDS and sexual economics. Portraying women as using sex to barter for male resources dehumanizes women because it signifies that their bodies are the most precious resource they have to exchange in a close relationship. The most sobering implication of the present results is that young adult men are still prone to dehumanizing women in precisely this way, which compromises the future of sexual equality.  

How did SET overlook men‚Äôs investment in patriarchy? Theories like SET and evolutionary psychology emphasize that women are valued mainly for sex, which renders their bodies and sexual attractiveness their main commodity. In past eras, women were taught to refine their manners and use their sexual power over men in order to soften blatant sexism (Rudman & Glick, 2008). However, in modern societies, women no longer need to rely on men for economic parity. Baumeister and Vohs (2004) acknowledged that ‚Äúthe social exchange surrounding sex may therefore be especially associated with cultures and periods in which women lack avenues other than being a supplier of sex for obtaining material and social resources‚Äù (p. 342). Consistent with this view, cross-cultural findings reveal that empowering women reduces the gender gap in sexual attitudes and behaviors (Eagly & Wood, 2005; Lippa, 2009; Schmitt, 2005) and in preference for mates with good financial prospects (Eagly & Wood, 1999; Zentner & Mitura, 2012). Therefore, we would expect to see more support for sexual exchange in nations (or subcultures) that blatantly suppress women. However, given the patriarchal roots and implications of sexual economics, we also expect men to generally endorse it more than women.","In the study reported here, data from implicit and behavioral choice measures did not support sexual economics theory‚Äôs (SET‚Äôs) central tenet that women view female sexuality as a commodity. Instead, men endorsed sexual exchange more than women did, which supports the idea that SET is a vestige of patriarchy. Further, men‚Äôs sexual advice, more than women‚Äôs, enforced the sexual double standard (i.e., men encouraged men more than women to have casual sex)‚Äîa gender difference that was mediated by hostile sexism, but also by men‚Äôs greater implicit investment in sexual economics. That is, men were more likely to suppress female sexuality because they resisted female empowerment and automatically associated sex with money more than women did. It appears that women are not invested in sexual economics, but rather, men are invested in patriarchy, even when it means raising the price of sexual relations.","1",0,"1","Political",2,0
134,23,"Chen, W., Pacheco, D., Yang, K. C., & Menczer, F. (2021). Neutral bots probe political bias on social media. Nature communications, 12(1), 5580.","The present results suggest that early choices about which sources to follow impact the experiences of social media users. This is consistent with previous studies. But beyond those initial actions, drifter behaviors are designed to be neutral with respect to partisan content and users. Therefore, the partisan-dependent differences in their experiences and actions can be attributed to their interactions with users and information mediated by the social media platform‚Äîthey reflect biases of the online information ecosystem.

Drifters with right-wing initial friends are gradually embedded into dense and homogeneous networks where they are constantly exposed to right-leaning content. They even start to spread right-leaning content themselves. Such online feedback loops reinforcing group identity may lead to radicalization, especially in conjunction with social and cognitive biases like in-/out-group bias and group polarization. The social network communities of the other drifters are less dense and partisan.

We selected popular news sources across the political spectrum as initial friends of the drifters. There are several possible confounding factors stemming from our choice of these accounts: their influence as measured by the number of followers, their popularity among users with a similar ideology, their activity in terms of tweets, and so on. For example, @FoxNews was popular but inactive at the time of the experiment. Furthermore, these quantities vary greatly both within and across ideological groups. While it is impossible to control for all of these factors with a limited number of drifters, we checked for a few possible confounding factors. We did not find a significant correlation between initial friend influence or popularity measures and drifter ego network transitivity. We also found that the influence of an initial friend is not correlated with the drifter influence. However, the popularity of an initial friend among sources with similar political bias is a confounding factor for drifter influence. Online influence is therefore affected by the echo-chamber characteristics of the social network, which are correlated with partisanship, especially on the political right.

In summary, drifters following more partisan news sources receive more politically aligned followers, becoming embedded in denser echo chambers and gaining influence within those partisan communities.

The fact that right-leaning drifters are exposed to considerably more low-credibility content than other groups is in line with previous findings that conservative users are more likely to engage with misinformation on social media. Our experiment suggests that the ecosystem can lead completely unbiased agents to this condition; therefore, it is not necessary to impute the vulnerability to characteristics of individual social media users. Other mechanisms that may contribute to the exposure to low-credibility content observed for the drifters initialized with right-leaning sources involve the actions of neighbor accounts (friends and followers) in the right-leaning groups, including the inauthentic accounts that target these groups.

Although Breitbart News was not labeled as a low-credibility source in our analysis, our finding might still be biased in reflecting this source‚Äôs low credibility in addition to its partisan nature. However, @BreitbartNews is one of the most popular conservative news sources on Twitter. While further experiments may corroborate our findings using alternative sources as initial friends, attempting to factor out the correlation between conservative leanings and vulnerability to misinformation may yield a less representative sample of politically active accounts.

While most drifters are embedded in clustered and homogeneous network communities, the echo chambers of conservative accounts grow especially dense and include a larger portion of politically active accounts. Social bots also seem to play an important role in the partisan social networks; the drifters, especially the right-leaning ones, end up following a lot of them. Since bots also amplify the spread of low-credibility news, this may help explain the prevalent exposure of right-leaning drifters to low-credibility sources. Drifters initialized with far-left sources do gain more followers and follow more bots compared with the center group. However, this occurs in a way that is less emphatic and vulnerable to low-credibility content compared to the right and center-right groups. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with findings that partisanship on both sides of the political spectrum increases the vulnerability to manipulation by social bots.

Twitter has been accused of favoring liberal content and users. We examined the possible bias in Twitter‚Äôs news feed, i.e., whether the content to which a user is exposed in the home timeline is selected in a way that amplifies or suppresses certain political content produced by friends. Our results suggest this is not the case: in general, the drifters receive content that is closely aligned with whatever their friends produce. A limitation of this analysis is that it is based on limited sets of recent tweets from drifter home timelines. The exact posts to which Twitter users are exposed in their news feeds might differ due to the recommendation algorithm, which is not available via Twitter‚Äôs programmatic interface.

Despite the lack of evidence of political bias in the news feed, drifters that start with left-leaning sources shift toward the right during the course of the experiment, sharing and being exposed to more moderate content. Drifters that start with right-leaning sources do not experience a similar exposure to moderate information and produce increasingly partisan content. These results are consistent with observations that right-leaning bots do a better job at influencing users.

In summary, our experiment demonstrates that even if a platform has no partisan bias, the social networks and activities of its users may still create an environment in which unbiased agents end up in echo chambers with constant exposure to partisan, inauthentic, and misleading content. In addition, we observe a net bias whereby the drifters are drawn toward the political right. On the conservative side, they tend to receive more followers, find themselves in denser communities, follow more automated accounts, and are exposed to more low-credibility content. Users have to make extra efforts to moderate the content they consume and the social ties they form in order to counter these currents and create a healthy and balanced online experience. Given the political neutrality of the news feed curation, we find no evidence for attributing the conservative bias of the information ecosystem to intentional interference by the platform. The bias can be explained by the use (and abuse) of the platform by its users, and possibly to unintended effects of the policies that govern this use: neutral algorithms do not necessarily yield neutral outcomes. For example, Twitter may remove or demote information from low-credibility sources and/or inauthentic accounts or suspend accounts that violate its terms. To the extent that such content or users tend to be partisan, the net result would be a bias toward the center. How to design mechanisms capable of mitigating emergent biases in online information ecosystems is a key question that remains open for debate.","Social media platforms attempting to curb abuse and misinformation have been accused of political bias. We deploy neutral social bots who start following different news sources on Twitter, and track them to probe distinct biases emerging from platform mechanisms versus user interactions. We find no strong or consistent evidence of political bias in the news feed. Despite this, the news and information to which U.S. Twitter users are exposed depend strongly on the political leaning of their early connections. The interactions of conservative accounts are skewed toward the right, whereas liberal accounts are exposed to moderate content shifting their experience toward the political center. Partisan accounts, especially conservative ones, tend to receive more followers and follow more automated accounts. Conservative accounts also find themselves in denser communities and are exposed to more low-credibility content.","4",0,"4","Political",3,1
135,23,"O'Connor, K., Karl, J., & Dunne, S. (2024). Picture Perfect: Exploring the Relationship between Problematic TikTok Use, Physical Appearance Perfectionism, and Upward Physical Appearance Comparison on Body Appreciation. Current Research in Behavioral Sciences, 100156.","To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the relationship between problematic TikTok use, physical appearance perfectionism, upward physical appearance comparison, and body appreciation. A plethora of literature has highlighted the negative relationship between problematic Instagram use and BI, however, there is little reported on the relationship between TikTok use and BI. Furthermore, prior research has reported the mediating effect of physical appearance perfectionism (Simon et al., 2022) and upward physical appearance comparison (e.g., McComb and Mills, 2021) between frequent Instagram use and BI, thus, we had a particular interest in investigating the mediating effect of physical appearance perfectionism and upward physical appearance comparison between problematic TikTok use and body appreciation.

In line with our first hypothesis, a serial mediation analysis revealed that physical appearance perfectionism strongly mediated the relationship between problematic TikTok use and body appreciation. Although these are preliminary results with regards to TikTok use, these findings are in accordance with comparable previous studies. For example, a recent study by Simon et al. (2022) reported that physical appearance perfectionism significantly mediated the relationship between Instagram addiction and body esteem. As we found no direct path between problematic TikTok use and body appreciation, the results of our current study suggest that although TikTok use may not necessarily lead to negative BI in the general population, physical appearance perfectionism may play a vital underlying role in negatively influencing this relationship. This is supported by the comprehensive literature which has suggested that physical appearance perfectionism has a potential role to play in how the use of social networking sites can negatively impact BI (Yang and Stoeber, 2012). Thus, these findings indicate that the consistent and regular use of TikTok among individuals high in physical appearance perfectionism may lead to negative BI. Given this, future research should explore the specific aspects of TikTok that may increase negative BI in individuals high in physical appearance perfectionism, such as the types of accounts they follow.

As mentioned previously, our mediation analysis found no direct path between TikTok use and body appreciation, however, problematic TikTok use and body appreciation were negatively related through bivariate analysis. These findings suggest that although there is an association between problematic TikTok use and body appreciation, the direct relationship does not hold once indirect paths are introduced. As physical appearance perfectionism had a strong effect in our serial mediation analysis, we suggest that it is the consistent and regular use of TikTok among individuals high in physical appearance perfectionism that may lead to low levels of body appreciation, rather than TikTok use itself. Thus, we cannot conclude that problematic TikTok use directly leads to negative BI. These results are in line with a recent study by Bissonette Mink and Szymanski (2022), which found that at the bivariate level, frequent TikTok use was positively associated with body dissatisfaction, however at the multivariate level, these variables were not directly related. As the findings on TikTok use and BI differ from those found on other appearance-based SNSs such as Instagram (e.g., Brown and Tiggemann, 2016), we suggest that there may be more differences among these apps than we initially predicted. Furthermore, in line with similar studies (e.g., Bissonette Mink and Szymanski, 2022), this study measured problematic TikTok use and did not consider the various aspects of TikTok that may play an important role in eliciting BI concerns. We suggest that future research explore how, and if, certain aspects of the app are related to negative BI, to implement methods to prevent any potential damaging effects of the app.

Our second hypothesis was based on the social comparison theory, which suggests that the circulation of idealized body standards online provides opportunities for users to engage in upward physical appearance comparisons to people they deem more attractive than themselves (Engeln‚ÄìMaddox, 2005). In turn, this elicits a perceived negative contrast between oneself and the idealized appearance (Fardouly et al., 2017), resulting in various BI concerns, such as body dissatisfaction (Fardouly et al., 2017). Previous studies found that upward physical appearance comparison fully mediated the relationship between browsing on Instagram and lower levels of body appreciation (Pedalino and Camerini, 2022), thus similar results were expected in this study with regard to TikTok use.

However, contrary to our second hypothesis, we found that upward physical appearance comparison did not significantly mediate the relationship between problematic TikTok use and body appreciation. However, upward physical appearance comparison and body appreciation were positively related through bivariate analysis. Similar to the relationship between TikTok use and body appreciation, these findings suggest that although upward physical appearance comparison and body appreciation are associated, the direct relationship does not hold once indirect paths are introduced. One possible reason for the non-significant effect of upward physical appearance comparison in our serial mediation analysis may be due to the strong mediating effect of physical appearance perfectionism. Furthermore, due to the video nature of TikTok, it may be more difficult to readily edit videos of oneself. Indeed, a recent article by an ‚Äòinfluencer‚Äô marketing software (Aslam, 2022) reported that TikTok users differ from those on Instagram, as they often produce content that is more natural and homemade (GRIN, 2023). Therefore, TikTok users may be subjected to more realistic content, which has been found to reduce the negative consequence of appearance comparison (e.g., Tiggemann and Anderberg, 2020). Thus, it is possible that the detrimental effects of engaging in upward physical appearance comparisons may be less predominant among TikTok users due to a limited exposure to edited content in comparison to other appearance-based SNSs, such as Instagram.

It is important to note that our findings are inconsistent with the only previous study on TikTok use and upward physical appearance comparison, which found that upward physical appearance comparison mediated the relationship between frequent TikTok use and body dissatisfaction (Bissonette Mink and Szymanski, 2022). However, their study, like much of the previous research on upward physical appearance comparison and BI, was restricted to female participants (e.g., Pedalino and Camerini, 2022). As women are more likely to engage in social comparisons to peers, models, and celebrities (Verduyn et al., 2020), this may explain why the findings in our current study are inconsistent with those previously found by Bissonette Mink and Szymanski (2022). To address these inconsistencies, future research may utilize moderated mediation analysis with gender as the moderator to further explore the impact of gender in these relationships, as this was not possible in the present study due to male sample size restrictions.

Furthermore, our conflicting results may be due to the strong effect of physical appearance perfectionism in our serial mediation analysis, which suggests a potential overlapping of variance between physical appearance perfectionism and upward physical appearance comparison, thus indicating that physical appearance perfectionism may play a more important role in mediating the relationship between problematic TikTok use and body appreciation than upward physical appearance comparison. Thus, as the literature in this area is extremely limited, it is difficult to determine if the social comparison theory can be applied to TikTok. It may be beneficial for future studies to explore the role of other processes such as self-discrepancy (Higgins, 1987) or self-objectification (Fredrickson and Roberts, 1997). Given that upward physical appearance comparison has been associated with BI concerns such as disordered eating outcomes (Arigo et al., 2014) and body dissatisfaction (Fardouly et al., 2017), future research is needed to determine how and if certain aspects of TikTok are related to upward physical appearance comparison to identify how individuals may be more susceptible to the negative consequences of the app.","Physical appearance perfectionism and upward physical appearance comparisons have a potential role in explaining how the use of popular social networking sites can negatively impact a person‚Äôs body image. Although there is considerable research on the relationship between body image and problematic Instagram usage, there is little reported on TikTok use. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the mediating relationship of physical appearance perfectionism and upward physical appearance comparison between problematic TikTok use and body appreciation. The sample included 185 TikTok users. Serial mediation analysis revealed a significant indirect negative relationship between problematic TikTok use and body appreciation through physical appearance perfectionism, but not upward physical appearance comparison, or physical appearance perfectionism and upward physical appearance comparison in serial. Thus, with the rapid growth of TikTok, this study highlights the importance of identifying the individuals who may be more vulnerable to the effects of the app. We suggest possible practice implications such as the implementation of screening strategies to identify those high in physical appearance perfectionism, and the development of workshops aimed at promoting positive body image in the face of SNS use.","2",0,"2","Political",4,1
136,23,"Wu, S., Chen, B., Webster, C., Xu, B., & Gong, P. (2023). Improved human greenspace exposure equality during 21st century urbanization. Nature Communications, 14(1), 6460.","Global urbanization promotes increasing population growth and socio-economic prosperity but also enhances environmental degradation, which substantially challenges urban sustainability. The unequal distribution of greenspace and its exposure is one of the pressing issues in urban sustainability and public health, especially in rapidly urbanizing Global South cities. Greenspace, as a key component of urban nature and a direct pathway to achieving the 11th Sustainable Development Goal, is widely understood to be reduced by urbanization for individual and even global cities. We note, however, this is not entirely true, due to greenspace being a superior economic good (i.e., good beyond the routine part of everyday life), the demand for which rises with income. This gives rise to different dynamics between the Global South and North, and differences within cities of these two broad global regions.

Recent satellite-based evidence reveals that at the start of the 21st century, the positive effects of urbanization on vegetation growth have been increasing, which may partially counteract the loss of vegetation caused by land transformation in earlier stages of urbanization, and lead to improved human exposure to greenspace. By combining this data with global population mappings, we were able to quantify the temporal trends in greenspace exposure and inequality over the past two decades. Our results show that greenspace coverage has increased overall across global cities, with 648 (63%) out of 1028 global cities experiencing positive trends of vegetation increases. This suggests that greening management activities have surpassed the loss of vegetation caused by land cover transformation in urban expansion. This finding is consistent with results from previous studies based on coarse-resolution satellite observations over global areas and city-specific regions. The rate of urban greening varies based on factors such as climate, urban development intensity, and population density.

Prominent spatial differences in urban greenspace trends have been revealed across our sample of global cities, particularly in the contrast between cities in the Global North and Global South. Global North cities that are highly urbanized have become greener over the past two decades, the likely cause of which is more green real estate building and green urban planning and city management by both private and public developers and agencies. On the other hand, cities with lower levels of urbanization in the Global North are still experiencing vegetation cover loss. This contrast highlights the different priorities for greening management policy and action in various urbanization contexts.

Our results indicate that exposure to greenspace has improved for most global urban residents over the past two decades, but the distribution of greenspace exposure remains highly uneven across income and demographic groups. While wealthier communities tend to have more access to greenspaces, marginalized populations in lower-income areas remain disproportionately disadvantaged. Addressing these disparities through targeted policies such as equitable urban planning, expansion of public green areas, and community-driven greening initiatives is crucial to promoting both environmental sustainability and social justice.

Future research should aim to further explore the underlying mechanisms that contribute to greenspace inequalities in cities, including economic, political, and cultural factors. Additionally, longitudinal studies are needed to assess the long-term effects of urbanization on greenspace exposure and its associated benefits for public health and well-being.","Greenspace plays a crucial role in urban ecosystems and has been recognized
as a key factor in promoting sustainable and healthy city development. Recent
studies have revealed a growing concern about urban greenspace exposure
inequality; however, the extent to which urbanization affects human exposure
to greenspace and associated inequalities over time remains unclear. Here, we
incorporate a Landsat-based 30-meter time-series greenspace mapping and a
population-weighted exposure framework to quantify the changes in human
exposure to greenspace and associated equality (rather than equity) for 1028
global cities from 2000 to 2018. Results show a substantial increase in physical
greenspace coverage and an improvement in human exposure to urban
greenspace, leading to a reduction in greenspace exposure inequality over the
past two decades. Nevertheless, we observe a contrast in the rate of reduction
in greenspace exposure inequality between cities in the Global South and
North, with a faster rate of reduction in the Global South, nearly four times that
of the Global North. These findings provide valuable insights into the impact of
urbanization on urban nature and environmental inequality change and can
help inform future city greening efforts.","6",1,"3","Political",4,1

Urban, planning and transport research, 10(1), 2145350.","It can be a challenging task to select a suitable behavioral science theory, model, or concept that fits a specific research task. Human behavior is complex. Certain factors such as resource constraints or the availability of data may place some limitations on the suitability of some theories. However, even within such limitations, a selection might be daunting. Understanding the complexity of the behavior under scrutiny is the first step that helps make a choice. Accordingly, in this paper, the 4DB framework by Chatterton and Wilson (2014) has been used as a basis to understand the multifaceted character of a specific behavior. Furthermore, extending the 4DB framework helps to understand which behavioral science cluster covers the complexity of the respective behavior. Behavioral science is a complex interdisciplinary field that offers many different vantage points to understand human behavior. The great number of different theories, models, and concepts can make it difficult to select one of these vantage points. Therefore, in this paper, four clusters of behavioral science approaches have been introduced. These four clusters help to make a pre-selection to guide further literature study to then find a suitable behavioral science approach. To this end, the 4DB framework has been extended to include the four clusters. The resulting 4DBC framework helps to systematically select an approach and, subsequently, a specific theory, model, or concept. Using the framework, the selection of a behavioral science approach is guided by the behavior under scrutiny rather than by disciplinary limitations. Thus, the framework helps to transcend disciplinary boundaries. Filling in the framework helps to make a deliberate decision about which body of literature the analyst may want to consult first to find an approach that best suits the research task. To further facilitate the selection of a suitable behavioral science approach, the framework column ‚ÄòApproach‚Äô can be filled in with the help of Table 4. Even if no theory will be able to capture the full complexity of a specific behavior, the framework also provides insights into the aspects that are excluded from an analysis. This might be insightful, when drawing conclusions at the end of an analysis or when, for example, a specific model has shown to not (or not fully) explain the behavior under scrutiny. Not only is behavioral science itself an interdisciplinary field, including behavioral insights is increasingly a requirement of other interdisciplinary research fields, such as sustainability science. The four clusters of behavioral science approaches and the 4DBC framework will hopefully contribute to helping researchers in interdisciplinary fields to include behavioral science within their research.","Interdisciplinary research is becoming increasingly important to tackle complex problems such as climate change. Human behavior is one key factor that needs to be considered to find solutions to these complex problems. Working in an interdisciplinary field requires scientists to engage in tedious studies of disciplines that are beyond their core expertise. This is also true for the selection of behavioral science approaches best suitable for the research question at hand. To provide a concise introduction to behavioral science, this article provides four clusters of behavioral science approaches. These four clusters, in conjunction with the further developed 4 DBC framework, can assist the analyst in systematically selecting the most suitable behavioral science approach. To illustrate the application of the framework, the examples of cycling and Practice Theory are used.","4",1,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,1

State-level macro-economic factors moderate the association of low income with brain structure and mental health in US children. Nature communications, 14(1), 2085.","We found that lower family income is associated with smaller hippocampal volume and greater internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in early adolescence, replicating prior findings in smaller samples and previous analyses of a smaller portion of the ABCD sample. Critically, however, we demonstrate that the magnitude of these associations varies as a function of state-level macrostructural characteristics‚Äîincluding the cost of living and generosity of antipoverty programs. The disparities between high- and low-income participants in hippocampal volume and internalizing problems were 34% to 48% smaller, respectively, in states that had a high cost of living but that provided more generous benefits for lower-income families, as compared to high cost of living states with less generous benefits. In high cost of living states where anti-poverty programs were more generous, the association of family income with hippocampal volume and internalizing problems resembled that of the lowest cost of living states. Importantly, these associations were robust to controls for other state-level social, economic, political, and educational factors‚Äîincluding population density, unemployment rate, political preferences, and state-funded preschool enrollment‚Äîthereby ruling out some alternative explanations. These controls capture a diverse set of macrostructural characteristics that covary geographically with cost of living and the generosity of anti-poverty programs, with varying degrees of relevance for children and families with low income.  

Together, these findings suggest that macrostructural factors related to the generosity of the state‚Äôs social safety net for families living in poverty are associated with socioeconomic disparities in hippocampal volume and internalizing problems, and that structural policy interventions may be an effective strategy for reducing these disparities, though this interpretation awaits replication with other research designs (e.g., quasi-experiments). One reason why cost of living and the generosity of anti-poverty programs may be associated with differences in the strength of the associations among family income, hippocampal volume, and mental health is because they may amplify or reduce stressors associated with low income. Having greater financial resources may shield families from experiencing some of the chronic stressors associated with low income that can influence hippocampal development. Further, by increasing financial resources and access to healthcare (i.e., in states that expanded Medicaid benefits), it is plausible that more generous anti-poverty programs could decrease the negative impact of some stressful life events on hippocampal volume and internalizing problems. Cumulative stress exposure is by no means the only potential process linking family income with neurodevelopment and mental health that might be impacted by the generosity of anti-poverty programs, however. For example, low income is also associated with lower cognitive stimulation, less supervision by adults, and a less predictable environment. An ongoing experimental study that randomized families to receive cash benefits has already found that those benefits may contribute to alterations in neural function and thus may shed light on the role of these processes in explaining why the generosity of anti-poverty programs is associated with differences in the strength of the associations between low family income, neurodevelopment, and mental health.  

Given that we observed the same type of 3-way interaction of family income and cost of living with cash assistance and Medicaid expansion, we expect that these policy differences‚Äîwhile helpful in and of themselves‚Äîare likely indicative of a broader collection of policies and structural supports for families facing economic hardship that were not directly measured in this study but that reflect the generosity of the state‚Äôs social safety net for low-income families (e.g., availability of free or reduced-cost early childhood education programs). Indeed, in supplemental analyses, we examined the 3-way interactions of family income, cost of living, and the state minimum wage‚Äîanother indicator of the generosity of the state‚Äôs social safety net for families with low income‚Äîin relation to hippocampal volume, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems, and found a similar pattern of results. In addition, the study design only allows us to evaluate whether anti-poverty programs that differ between states may mitigate socioeconomic disparities in hippocampal volume and mental health. Programs such as SNAP, which are administered uniformly across states, are also associated with reductions in adverse childhood experiences and improved health and educational outcomes.  

These findings have broad methodological implications for research on environmental factors in psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Most psychology and neuroimaging studies are conducted in a single community. In such designs, all participants experience the same macro-social context, which requires a focus solely on individual- and interpersonal-level explanations for observed associations. However, our results, together with other recent studies, demonstrate that the magnitude of individual-level associations between environmental factors, like family income, and developmental outcomes, like brain structure and psychopathology, vary systematically as a function of characteristics of the macro-social context. This context therefore demands consideration when comparing results collected in different communities and may provide an explanation for replication failures in studies focused on associations measured solely at the individual level. The degree to which different aspects of macro-social context moderate other individual-level associations is an important question that could be explored in many additional ways in the ABCD data.  

Some limitations are worth noting. First, this is a cross-sectional and observational study. However, it is implausible that children‚Äôs hippocampal volume could alter their family‚Äôs income or state-level characteristics, and simple slopes analyses suggested that the interaction of anti-poverty programs and cost of living in relation to hippocampal volume was specific to low-income participants who would benefit from anti-poverty programs. We also conducted numerous sensitivity analyses to ensure that alternative state-level social, economic, educational, and political characteristics did not explain these patterns. Further, the observational associations we document based on existing anti-poverty programs complement emerging causal evidence of the impact of cash assistance on children‚Äôs neurodevelopment. That said, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that other factors beyond cost of living and the generosity of anti-poverty programs may be explaining the variation in associations of family income with hippocampal volume and internalizing problems. Natural experiments may one day be feasible with this dataset as policy changes at the state level unfold in the future. However, this type of design is not possible at this time with the ABCD data because there have been no changes in these poverty-relevant policies during the data collection period in the states where ABCD data were collected. Nor, to our knowledge, are there any other datasets that have collected harmonized neuroimaging data on children living in different contexts over time to allow policy changes to be examined as predictors of changes in neural outcomes.  

Second, the ABCD study sites are located in only 17 of the 50 states. This restricted range would have reduced our statistical power to detect moderation, and thus our estimates are likely conservative. At the same time, cost of living and the generosity of anti-poverty programs are correlated within those states, which limits our ability to tease apart these factors. Third, the state-level macrostructural characteristics examined here are confounded with scanner and the demographics of the sample at each site to some degree. However, we control for both scanner and the racial and ethnic makeup of the sample in our analyses. While it is possible that scanner differences contribute to systematic differences in volume estimation of the hippocampus (i.e., the mean volume in each state), it is implausible that scanner differences would produce systematic changes in the association between family income and hippocampal volume.  

Another potential issue is that the parent-reported family income could include cash assistance received by the family. Consequently, the income measure may already include variance related to the putative moderator. However, when repeating analyses using a dichotomous indicator of poverty, the results were consistent with the current findings. Further, more generous anti-poverty programs, particularly cash assistance, may not reduce stress by increasing monthly or yearly income in all cases. For example, these programs may allow families to make decisions that lead to a decrease in wages but that also reduce stress, such as working fewer hours.  

Finally, all participants in the sample were 9‚Äì11 years old at the time of data collection, so our ability to generalize these findings to other ages is limited. However, as the ABCD cohort ages, and, potentially, as state-level policies and macro-economic conditions change over time, there will be opportunities to address this limitation and expand upon these findings in the future.  

Lower family income is associated with smaller hippocampal volume and higher internalizing problems. However, we show that these relationships are moderated by state-level macrostructural characteristics. Socioeconomic disparities in hippocampal volume and internalizing problems were reduced by 34%‚Äì48% in high cost of living states with more generous anti-poverty programs. This finding suggests that macrostructural conditions related to poverty influence neurodevelopment and mental health, emphasizing the relevance of public policies that increase family financial resources.","Macrostructural characteristics, such as cost of living and state-level antipoverty programs relate to the magnitude of socioeconomic disparities in brain development and mental health. In this study we leveraged data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study from 10,633 9-11 year old youth (5115 female) across 17 states. Lower income was associated with smaller hippocampal volume and higher internalizing psychopathology. These associations were stronger in states with higher cost of living. However, in high cost of living states that provide more generous cash benefits for low-income families, socioeconomic disparities in hippocampal volume were reduced by 34%, such that the association of family income with hippocampal volume resembled that in the lowest cost of living states. We observed similar patterns for internalizing psychopathology. State-level anti-poverty programs and cost of living may be confounded with other factors related to neurodevelopment and mental health. However, the patterns were robust to controls for numerous state-level social, economic, and political characteristics. These findings suggest that state-level macrostructural characteristics, including the generosity of anti-poverty policies, are potentially relevant for addressing the relationship of low income with brain development and mental health.","2",0,"2","Political",2,1

The effects of physical exercise on mental health: From cognitive improvements to risk of addiction. International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 18(24), 13384.","Regarding the benefits of physical exercise on cognitive functions, most of the considered sample demonstrated greater precision and response speed in information processing tasks. Children showed improvements in executive functions, selective attention, linguistic understanding, lexical network expansion, syntactic and spelling skills, working memory, cognitive flexibility, inhibition control, and school performance.  

A key aspect of our review was the examination of ADHD in children, where findings indicate that short-term aerobic exercise, based on various aerobic intervention formats, appears effective in mitigating symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and anxiety. Additionally, exercise may enhance executive functions and alleviate socio-relational behavioral disorders.  

For adults over 50 years old, physical exercise is inversely correlated with the risk of cognitive decline and the onset of dementia. It also promotes notable improvements in executive functions, visuospatial functions, episodic memory, verbal fluency, processing speed, and overall cognitive functions.  

Additionally, our review explored the role of exercise in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder or bipolar disorder. Findings suggest that exercise dosage is a crucial factor in achieving cognitive improvements. Previous studies indicate that the amount of exercise performed by participants during an intervention significantly predicts enhancements in overall cognitive functions, general intellectual skills, verbal memory, and working memory.  

The second focus of our review concerns exercise addiction and potential individual and situational predictors of its onset. Results suggest that risk factors for developing exercise addiction include high weekly running time, early-life engagement in physical activity, low education levels, high anxiety and hostility, loneliness, low self-esteem, and gender, with a higher prevalence in females. Additionally, personality traits such as persistence, tenacity, self-directedness, harm avoidance, and intolerance of uncertainty were identified as potential predictors.  

Other risk factors include the presence of dysfunctional eating patterns, eating disorders, or concerns related to body and muscle dysmorphia. Furthermore, an inability to engage in exercise‚Äîparticularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic‚Äîappears to exacerbate risks, especially among individuals with high levels of passion and perfectionism.  

It is important to note the absence of specific studies on the cognitive consequences of exercise addiction. Most existing literature focuses on risk factors and consequences such as physical damage due to excessive exertion and deterioration of interpersonal or work relationships. We hypothesize that, as a behavioral addiction, exercise addiction may influence cognitive constructs such as impulsivity, compulsivity, and attention regulation. These factors could be relevant for understanding and treating behavioral addictions, though this hypothesis requires further investigation.  

This review has several limitations. First, the inclusion of both healthy and clinical populations without distinction may pose challenges, as cognitive enhancement effects differ across groups. In some cases, individuals with higher baseline cognitive functioning exhibit reduced improvements compared to clinical populations. Additionally, neuroplasticity mechanisms vary; while neurostimulation techniques can induce behavioral changes in clinical populations, long-term alterations may be necessary for similar effects in healthy individuals. However, some studies suggest the opposite, reporting greater cognitive changes in non-clinical populations, which necessitates further research.  

Second, we do not discuss the cognitive factors of sports addiction or the associated risks. Lastly, our analysis of risk factors for exercise addiction during the COVID-19 pandemic is based on an event still unfolding. Although lockdowns have ended, the long-term psychological consequences remain uncertain.  

In conclusion, these findings highlight the potential for more informed policies promoting physical activity (PA) as a tool to enhance cognitive function throughout an individual‚Äôs lifespan. Consistent with existing literature, our review underscores the significant benefits of physical activity in fostering mental health and cognitive enhancement in both healthy individuals and those with psychiatric disorders. On the other hand, our findings also emphasize the necessity of psychological-clinical evaluations to assess distress and personality traits linked to exercise addiction. Maintaining a balanced approach to sports practice could serve as an effective coping strategy, helping individuals manage daily stress and negative emotions in a manner conducive to their overall mental and physical well-being.","Abstract: (1) **Background**: We aimed to investigate the effects of physical activity on cognitive functions and deficits in healthy populations and other needy groups. Secondly, we examined the relationship between healthy habits and psychopathological risks. Finally, we explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on exercise addiction and possible associated disorders. (2) **Methods**: From April 2021 to October 2021, we conducted a review to identify the effects of physical exercise on mental health, ranging from cognitive improvements to the risk of addiction. We searched for relevant studies on PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINHAL.

Additionally, data showed that exercise addiction is associated with low levels of education, low self-esteem, eating disorders, and body dysmorphisms. Furthermore, individuals with lower tolerance for uncertainty exhibited a strong correlation between COVID-19 anxiety and compulsive exercise and eating disorders.

140,24,"Kang, C., Kawamura, A., & Noguchi, H. (2022). Does free healthcare improve children‚Äôs healthcare use and outcomes? Evidence from Japan‚Äôs healthcare subsidy for young children. Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, 202, 372‚Äì406.","6. Discussion  
6.1. Price elasticity  
Based on our estimates, we calculated the price elasticity of demand for healthcare among children. As stated in Section 2, the Japanese healthcare system provides a non-discriminatory environment for calculating price elasticity, with no price discrimination by providers, because the national government determines the fixed fee for each medical activity. Hence, patients only need to pay a fixed amount, regardless of their insurance type. This property enables us to assume that changes in healthcare use originate only from quantity controls rather than from price.  
Based on our results for outpatient care use, as measured by visit intervals, the number of patients, and monthly spending, we calculated the semi-arc elasticity following Brot-Goldberg et al. (2017), as shown in Appendix F. We find that the semi-arc elasticity for children aged six years or less in Japan ranges from approximately ‚àí0.21 to ‚àí0.46. These numbers are slightly less than those found in previous studies, ranging between ‚àí0.049 and ‚àí0.63 for children aged seven to fourteen years in Japan (Iizuka and Shigeoka, 2018) and between ‚àí0.36 and ‚àí0.42 for children aged seven years in Sweden (Nilsson and Paul, 2018). Furthermore, it is considerably less than the range of ‚àí2.11‚Äì‚àí2.26 calculated from the RAND HIE for adults (Brot-Goldberg et al., 2017). In summary, our study suggests that the price elasticity of demand for healthcare is less for children than for adults.  
6.2. Cost-benefit analysis  
Another important interpretation of our findings is the costs and benefits of the subsidy. First, we calculated the cost of the subsidy per child saved. According to our estimates, the subsidy increases monthly outpatient spending for infants under 12 months of age (i.e., aged zero) by JPY 2387 (about USD 23.87) and reduces their mortality rate by 0.79 per 1000 infants. This result implies that the annual cost per saved life is approximately JPY 36 million (USD 0.36 million). Meanwhile, the statistical value of a life calculated by previous studies generally exceeds our estimated cost of saving a child‚Äôs life through the subsidy. For example, Itaoka et al. (2007) estimated the willingness to pay for reductions in mortality risk through environmental policies, suggesting that the value of a Japanese adult‚Äôs life ranges from JPY 103 to 344 million (approximately USD 1.03 to 3.44 million). Integrating these aspects, our study suggests that the introduction of the subsidy yields an acceptable cost-benefit ratio for policymakers.  
7. Conclusion and limitations  
Investments in child health can affect various adult outcomes; thus, many developed countries provide health insurance with generous coverage for children. However, past studies on the effect of such generous health insurance predominantly focus on adults or the elderly, and surprisingly little is known about children. In this study, we examined the comprehensive effect of free healthcare for preschool-age children on healthcare use and health outcomes. We utilized the unique variations in eligible age and the timing of subsidy introduction across municipalities in Japan.  
We found that the free healthcare subsidy for children significantly increased outpatient use, as measured by visit intervals, the number of repeat patients, and monthly spending. The size of the effects tends to be larger for young children, particularly among infants aged zero (i.e., under 12 months of age) and one year. However, we found little evidence of an increase in inpatient use under the subsidy. We found a significant increase in the length of a hospital stay only for infants who were hospitalized with any surgery. We also found that the subsidy significantly decreased the probability of having subjective symptoms, especially fever, cough, and nasal discharge. Further, the mortality rate for infants decreased by 0.79 per 1000 individuals. In summary, our study suggests that free healthcare improves children‚Äôs healthcare use as well as health outcomes, while its effect on health outcomes is limited for adults or the elderly, as shown by previous studies.  
This study has several limitations, mainly due to data restrictions. First, the PS and the SMCA used in this study only observed patients who used healthcare services rather than the entire population. As shown in the main results, we found that the number of patients who visited medical institutions increased sharply under the subsidy. These results suggest that children who visit under the subsidy are probably healthier, and thus, the composition of the samples before and after the change in subsidy status would be different. Thus, the results on health outcomes using these two data sources would be underestimated, that is, biased toward not finding any effects. To compensate for this problem, individual-level panel data are required; however, such data did not exist in the 1990s, a focus period in this study. Meanwhile, unlike the PS and SMCA, the CLSC comes from the entire population, but there is another concern about the results using these data. As mentioned in Section 3, we cannot identify which households reside in each of the 23 specified districts in the Tokyo Metropolis. Hence, for these households, we assigned individual data to the subsidy status of the entire Tokyo Metropolis. However, as shown in Table 1, there are substantial variations in the timing of subsidy expansion and maximum age eligibility within these areas. Thus, it would induce measurement errors, biasing the estimates to zero. We cannot find any effect on the probability of current use of outpatient care (i.e., extensive margin) using the CSLS, in contrast to effects on the number of patients (i.e., intensive margin) using the PS. The reason for this non-result on the extensive margin is driven by the above measurement errors.  
Second, we conducted a reduced-form analysis focusing on urban areas due to data availability. Because a reduced-form analysis could not ensure external validity, we are unsure whether our findings from urban areas could be generalized to rural areas. To this end, it is necessary to conduct a reduced-form analysis using rural areas‚Äô data or a structural analysis. However, it is currently difficult to collect information on subsidy status in rural areas as most municipalities do not open their municipal council minutes on their homepages. Considering that it is an important policy issue to understand how the subsidy program is effective in rural areas, this is a subject for future challenging work.  
Third, we focused only on the effect on children‚Äôs outcomes. Considering that the subsidy aimed not only to improve children‚Äôs health but also to support young parents with children, it may affect various parental outcomes, such as financial stress and health status. In particular, it seems likely that benefits from improvements in children‚Äôs subjective health might translate into an increase in the labor supply of parents (Baker et al., 2008; Bick 2016). For example, if parents view their children as having better subjective health, they might have lower rates of absenteeism in the workplace.  
Finally, although we mainly concentrated on the demand-side responses to free healthcare, examining the effect on the supply side is equally important. Since the subsidy increases the number of outpatients, it may provide incentives for physicians to migrate to municipalities adopting generous subsidies. Considering that the number of pediatric hospitals in Japan has been decreasing recently due to a decline in the total fertility rate, such migration may contribute to significant improvements in access to healthcare services for children.","We investigate the extent to which the subsidy for children‚Äôs healthcare in Japan affects children‚Äôs healthcare use and outcomes. The subsidy, which made children‚Äôs healthcare services essentially free for patients, was introduced and expanded to preschool-age children in the 1990s. We use a difference-in-differences framework by exploiting variations in subsidy status, as the introduction timing and eligibility age differ across municipalities.  

We find that the subsidy significantly increased the use of outpatient care, as measured by the number of patients, visit intervals, and monthly spending. We also find evidence of increased inpatient use, but only for infants under 12 months of age (i.e., aged zero). Furthermore, the subsidy significantly improved children‚Äôs subjective health symptoms reported by parents and contributed to reducing the mortality rate for infants by 0.79 per 1,000 individuals.  

In summary, our results suggest that free healthcare for children improves their access to healthcare as well as health outcomes, thus prioritizing this investment as part of national healthcare plans.","1",0,"1","Political",2,0
141,24,"Rocca, C. H., Moseson, H., Gould, H., Foster, D. G., & Kimport, K. (2021). Emotions over five years after denial of abortion in the United States: Contextualizing the effects of abortion denial on women‚Äôs health and lives. Social Science & Medicine, 269, 113567.","As many US states adopt increasingly lower gestational limits on abortion, there are pressing questions about the impact of abortion denial on pregnant people and their lives thereafter. We find that, a week after being denied an abortion, participants in the longitudinal study reported experiencing a mix of feelings including sadness, regret, and relief. Over time, as women carried the pregnancy to term and gave birth, negative emotions about the denial declined and positive feelings increased, remaining relatively steady between the child‚Äôs first birthday through five years (see Table 2). Similarly, a week after the denial, about two-thirds of participants still wished that they could have had the abortion; after childbirth, the figure was 12% and by five years, 4% (see Table 3).  

The qualitative findings help to explain these patterns. Initial emotions were largely negative, and the few positive emotions about being turned away expressed were often rooted in fear and beliefs about choosing abortion as something difficult to live with, as something they would likely regret, and as something physically dangerous. While it may be that these positive emotions stemmed from original ambivalence about seeking abortion, research has shown that decision uncertainty is very low among pregnant people presenting for abortion care, in line with or lower than for other kinds of outpatient care (Foster et al., 2012; Gatter et al., 2014; Ralph et al., 2017). Alternatively, scholars have shown that such beliefs of imminent regret and abortion danger are consistent with antiabortion narratives of the meaning of abortion that stigmatize abortion (Ehrlich and Doan, 2019; Kimport, forthcoming). These beliefs may have been internalized by study participants, offering grounds for feeling positive emotions immediately after abortion denial.  

Over time in this study, shifts in participants‚Äô feelings from negative to positive occurred in parallel with growing bonds with the baby and, for some, a new sense of purpose in life gained from the challenge of the responsibility of the child. Given strong social encouragement for mothers to bond with their babies (Layne, 2000; Mitchell and Georges, 1997), it makes sense that even participants who strongly desired an abortion and felt negatively about the abortion denial reported attachment to their children. Critically, Turnaway Study analyses found that, compared to women who received an abortion and had a subsequent pregnancy and birth, women who had babies after the abortion denial were at greater risk of poor maternal bonding with the baby, based on a psychometrically valid measure (Foster et al., 2018a). Still, the increasingly positive emotions reported by women in this study may reflect subconscious or conscious emotional management on the part of participants to align their feelings with social norms that honor and praise motherhood (Hochschild, 1979).  

Similarly, that the abortion denial prompted some participants to adopt a heightened sense of purpose in life is understandable and mirrors the changes in perceptions of the self, relationships, and life ‚Äì including positive evaluations of one‚Äôs situation ‚Äì that often follow unexpected and involuntary life events (Arnett, 2014; Kennedy et al., 2013; Tedeschi and Calhoun, 1996). Importantly, interviews suggested that successfully shifting toward a positive assessment of the abortion denial was not always automatic and, for some, required substantial instrumental social support from others.  

Notably, although the qualitative interview data demonstrate that some of participants‚Äô initial experiences of positive emotions and difficulty deciding to seek an abortion owed to their fears of the emotional impact of having an abortion, the empirical research on women‚Äôs post-abortion emotions indicates clearly that these fears are unfounded. That is, although interview participants‚Äîperhaps representing at least some of the larger sample‚Äîmentioned concerns about abortion causing physical and mental health harms and regret, the vast majority of women who have abortions experience none (Biggs et al., 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018; Rocca et al., 2015, 2020; Upadhyay et al., 2015). Indeed, Turnaway Study analyses have illustrated that participants who received the abortion experienced significantly more positive emotions one week after care-seeking than those denied the abortion (Rocca et al., 2013), and they, over time, experience declining emotional intensity about the abortion (Rocca et al., 2015). And, importantly, just as a small percentage of women denied abortions still wished they could have had one at five years, a small percentage of those who had the abortion reported they did not think the abortion was the right decision for them (or did not know) at five years (Rocca et al., 2020). But while those denied the abortion evolved toward that position over time, almost all women who had the abortion felt it was the right decision at all times over five years.  

Our findings highlight the range and complexity of women‚Äôs emotions regarding their experiences with pregnancy and abortion denial. Many participants initially expressed disappointment, fear, and uncertainty about their pregnancies, but eventually reported declining negative emotions about the denial. Similarly, in prior analyses, those who received the abortion initially experienced mixed emotions, the intensity of which declined over time. Experiencing mixed and evolving emotions toward an unintended pregnancy is common; pregnancies that were initially unwanted can become acceptable or wanted, sometimes depending on an individual‚Äôs religious beliefs, life circumstances, financial means, and community norms (Aiken et al., 2015, 2016; Gomez et al., 2018; Ralph et al., 2020). Our findings caution against overly simplistic characterizations of women‚Äôs emotions following unintended pregnancy and denial of an abortion.  

It is also critical to situate these findings among other outcomes of being denied an abortion. Compared to women who received their abortion, those denied care were more likely to experience subsequent poverty and to have insufficient money to pay for basic living expenses (Foster et al., 2018b; Miller et al., 2020). They experienced poorer physical health and were more likely to be in violent romantic relationships (Ralph et al., 2019; Roberts et al., 2014). Furthermore, over five years, women who received their abortion were more likely than those denied care to bear a child who was desired at the time, and they were better able to bond with those children (Foster et al., 2018a; Upadhyay et al., 2019). Together with findings that negative mental health consequences of abortion denial were short-lasting, the emergent positive emotions about having been denied the abortion we find may mask the very real and difficult public health and socioeconomic harms of abortion denial.  

4.1. Strengths and limitations  
Because no psychometrically validated measures of women‚Äôs emotional responses to abortion denial exist, we may not have captured the emotions that resonated most with participants in the longitudinal study (Rocca et al., 2015). Indeed, some of the emotions named spontaneously by interviewees ‚Äì overwhelm, dismay, devastation ‚Äì were not those we assessed in the longitudinal study. In addition, surveys asked women to reflect on their emotions about being turned away, not about their lives in general, so we cannot comment on people‚Äôs emotions about their lives overall. It is possible that women felt uncomfortable reporting negative emotions or a desire to still have had the abortion for fear of not being seen as a ‚Äúgood mom‚Äù (social desirability bias), given normative social expectations of the innate desire to mother (Hays, 1998). As such, our results are likely biased toward a more positive emotional picture than participants actually experienced.  

Our qualitative interviews were conducted over five years after the actual denial of abortion, and thus responses were certain to have been influenced by emotions and situations that changed over time and modified by their interpretations of past events. However, the approach we used for this study prioritizes individuals‚Äô own interpretations of their experiences, acknowledging that those interpretations change over time (Carter and Fuller, 2015). That is, our goal was to understand women‚Äôs experiences as they understood them, even as informed in retrospect. Additionally, interview guides were designed to probe Turnaway Study findings through 2014‚Äì2015, before the longitudinal analyses presented here were conducted. As such, the interviews did not specifically probe interviewees about, for instance, how decision difficulty and social support might have affected their feelings about the abortion denial. Finally, we were limited to in-depth interviews of only two women who placed their babies for adoption, precluding our ability to explain the quantitative findings of the importance of adoption placement for subsequent emotions about the abortion denial. However, this study is the first to examine women denied abortions in the US and to follow them over five years. Our results are strengthened by a mixed-methods design, which improved our ability to interpret the quantitative findings.","Background: The Turnaway Study was the first to follow women denied abortions because of state law or facility policy over five years. The study has found negative effects on women‚Äôs socioeconomic status, physical health, and on their children‚Äôs wellbeing. However, women did not suffer lasting mental health consequences, prompting questions about the effects of denial on women‚Äôs emotions.  
Methods: In this mixed methods study, we used quantitative and qualitative interview data from the Turnaway Study to offer insight into these findings. We surveyed 161 women who were denied abortions at 30 facilities across the United States between 2008 and 2010 one week after the abortion denial and semiannually over five years. Mixed-effects regression analyses examined emotions about having been denied the abortion over time. To contextualize the quantitative findings, we draw on in-depth qualitative interviews with 15 participants, conducted in 2014-2015, for their accounts of their emotions and feelings over time.  
Results: Survey participants reported both negative and positive emotions about the abortion denial one week after. Emotions became significantly less negative and more positive over their pregnancy and after childbirth. In multivariable models, lower social support, more difficulty deciding to seek abortion, and placing the baby for adoption were associated with reporting more negative emotions. Interviews revealed how, for some, belief in antiabortion narratives contributed to initial positive emotions. Subsequent positive life events and bonding with the child also led to positive retrospective evaluations of the denial.  
Conclusions: Findings of emergent positive emotions about having been denied an abortion suggest that individuals are able to cope emotionally with an abortion denial, although evidence that policies leading to abortion denial cause significant health and socioeconomic harms remains.","7",1,"7","Political",2,0

American Psychologist, 64(9), 863.","Taking all of the above factors into consideration, we came to the following conclusions from our review and evaluation of the literature:  

First, the relative risk of mental health problems among adult women who have a single, legal, first-trimester abortion of an unwanted pregnancy for nontherapeutic reasons is no greater than the risk among women who deliver an unwanted pregnancy. This conclusion is generally consistent with that reached by the first APA task force on mental health and abortion (Adler et al., 1990), as well as with a recent review of the literature by Charles, Polis, Sridhara, and Blum (2008).  

Second, the relative risk of mental health problems among women who terminate a wanted pregnancy because of fetal abnormality appears to be similar to (and no greater than) that of women who miscarry a wanted pregnancy or experience a stillbirth or the death of a newborn.  

Third, the relative risk of mental health problems among young women in New Zealand, Australia, and Norway appears to be slightly but significantly higher if they report one or more abortions than if they report no abortions, delivering a baby, or no pregnancies. It is unclear to what extent these findings may be linked to the young age of these samples, the social context in which abortion occurred, the fact that abortion was measured through self-report rather than verified, or the failure of any of these studies to adequately assess whether a pregnancy was wanted.  

Fourth, the claim that observed associations between abortion history and a mental health problem are caused by the abortion per se, as opposed to other factors, is not supported by the existing evidence. As observed throughout this article, unwanted pregnancy and abortion are correlated with preexisting and co-occurring conditions, life circumstances, problem behaviors, and personality characteristics that can have profound and long-lasting negative effects on mental health irrespective of how a pregnancy is resolved. Although several recent studies have attempted to control for many of these factors, it is often impossible to control sufficiently for all of them.  

Fifth, the majority of adult women who terminate a pregnancy do not experience mental health problems. Across studies, the prevalence of disorders among women who terminated a pregnancy was low, and most women reported being satisfied with their decision to abort both one month and two years postabortion (Major et al., 2000).  

Sixth, although we conclude that most adult women do not have mental health problems following an abortion of an unwanted pregnancy, we do not mean to imply that no women experience such problems. Some women do. Abortion is an experience often hallmarked by ambivalence, and a mix of positive and negative emotions is to be expected (Adler et al., 1990; Dagg, 1991). Some women feel confident they made the right choice and feel no regret; others experience sadness, grief, guilt, and feelings of loss following the elective termination of a pregnancy. Some women experience clinically significant outcomes, such as depression or anxiety. It is important that all women‚Äôs experiences be recognized as valid and that women feel free to express their thoughts and feelings about their abortion regardless of whether those thoughts and feelings are positive or negative.  

Understanding the source of variation in women‚Äôs psychological responses is an important research agenda. Factors shown to be predictive of more negative psychological responses following first-trimester abortion among women in the United States include the extent to which a woman wanted and felt committed to her pregnancy, perceptions of stigma and associated perceived need for secrecy surrounding abortion, low perceived self-efficacy for coping with the abortion, low actual or anticipated social support for the abortion decision, and use of avoidance and denial coping strategies. A history of mental health problems prior to pregnancy emerged as the strongest predictor of postabortion mental health. It is important to note that many of these same factors also are predictive of negative psychological reactions to other types of stressful life events, including childbirth, and hence are not uniquely predictive of psychological responses following abortion.  

**A cautionary note.** The relationship between abortion and mental health is a highly contested issue. Some have claimed that a (presumed) negative relationship between abortion and mental health is a reason to make abortion less accessible. This argument is based on the reasoning that if abortion and a mental health problem (e.g., substance abuse) are related, then reducing access to abortion would reduce the prevalence of that problem. We would like to caution the reader against falling prey to this example of the ‚Äúinterventionist fallacy.‚Äù The interventionist fallacy results from the belief that if a relationship is currently observed between two variables, the form or magnitude of the relationship will remain unchanged if an intervention is instituted‚Äîfor instance, if the availability of abortion were to be dramatically reduced. As applied to the case of abortion, this reasoning (that if the number of abortions were to decrease, then there would be a proportional decrease in mental health problems) is flawed. One consequence of such an intervention would be that the characteristics of the population of women who delivered children would change. Characteristics previously more prevalent among women who have abortions (e.g., greater poverty, problem behaviors, exposure to violence) would now be more prevalent among women who deliver. Note that this potential change in the profile of women giving birth may include new mental health problems that might develop from stresses associated with raising a child a woman feels unable to care for or may not want or from relinquishing a child for adoption. Thus, reducing access to abortion could result in poorer mental health among the population of women who deliver. Hence, rather than reducing the prevalence of mental health problems among women, this intervention could potentially increase it.","The authors evaluated empirical research addressing the relationship between induced abortion and women‚Äôs mental health. Two issues were addressed: (a) the relative risks associated with abortion compared with the risks associated with its alternatives and (b) sources of variability in women‚Äôs responses following abortion. This article reflects and updates the report of the American Psychological Association Task Force on Mental Health and Abortion (2008). Major methodological problems pervaded most of the research reviewed. The most rigorous studies indicated that within the United States, the relative risk of mental health problems among adult women who have a single, legal, first-trimester abortion of an unwanted pregnancy is no greater than the risk among women who deliver an unwanted pregnancy. Evidence did not support the claim that observed associations between abortion and mental health problems are caused by abortion per se as opposed to other preexisting and co-occurring risk factors. Most adult women who terminate a pregnancy do not experience mental health problems. Some women do, however. It is important that women‚Äôs varied experiences of abortion be recognized, validated, and understood.","4",0,"4","Political",3,0

Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, 22(4), 113‚Äì118.","The question ‚ÄòWhat is known about the lived experiences of men whose partners have undergone perinatal loss?‚Äô framed the synthesis of the literature. In answering the proposed question, the following three key themes and subthemes emerged:

Pregnancy and the aftermath

Attachment in utero

The way in which men processed perinatal loss was related to how they perceived the pregnancy. Across the studies, men had differing concepts of when the pregnancy came to represent a living child. One major aspect that influenced their perceptions was witnessing the first signs of life usually through a techno‚Äêmediated relationship, for example seeing an ultrasound or hearing a heartbeat. Men who perceived the pregnancy as an irreplaceable infant expressed stronger grief responses and had greater difficulties in coping. In comparison, men who did not conceive the pregnancy yet as an individual child but rather as the loss of a potential child expressed feelings of shock and disappointment; however, this was not sustained over a period of time. Although gestation can be one factor influencing attachment, there is limited discussion on men who had experienced difficulties conceiving or perhaps utilised in vitro fertilisation, and if this could potentially affect their perceptions and therefore attachments to the pregnancy.

Identity formation after perinatal loss

Discrepancies were also evident in men's self‚Äêidentification as a ‚Äòfather‚Äô after a perinatal loss. For births where physical remains of an infant existed, generally in late‚Äêterm miscarriage or still‚Äêbirth, men had the opportunity to engage in post‚Äêbirth care. In both Bonettte and Broom's (2012) and Samuelsson et al.'s (2001) studies, men reported the time spent with their still‚Äêborn as a valuable fathering experience. Tokens of remembrance including handprints and photographs were deemed invaluable to assist men understand their loss afterwards, solidifying their identity as a grieving father. However, in McCreight's (2004) study, contact with still‚Äêborn remains had a detrimental and traumatic effect on the men. Participants reported that they were not prepared by staff and had no prior knowledge of how to handle the remains.

In contrast, there seemed to be limited formal mechanisms or rituals in place to validate men's grief in the event of miscarriage, particularly in the early stages of pregnancy. Studies focusing solely on miscarriage included no discussion of any post‚Äêbirth care routines or tokens of remembrance within a hospital setting. While still‚Äêbirths had clear, legal processes regarding burial arrangements, in the cases of miscarriage, burial protocols widely differed between hospitals and were dependent upon the knowledge and sensitivity of medical and nursing staff involved. As a result, men in McCreight's (2004) and Meaney et.al's (2017) studies commonly expressed uncertainty in their identity as a father, particularly those who experienced early miscarriages and who did not have the opportunity to validate their loss through customary protocols. Men in these two studies experienced early miscarriages from as far back as 20 years prior to the interviews, suggesting that perinatal loss can lead to ambiguous grief, complicating their capacity to process and understand the event even decades afterwards as the loss and its associated meaning to men may evolve over time.

Supporting and being supported

Men supporting their partner

Consistent throughout the studies is that men viewed their primary role as being the ‚Äòsupporter‚Äô for their partners. In Hamama‚ÄêRaz et al.'s (2010) study of five Jewish couples who had experienced miscarriages, men commonly reported that focusing on their partner provided them with strength and purpose, enabling them to bypass their own pain. While this can provide men with a means to cope, to fulfil this role a majority felt pressured to hide their emotions altogether to avoid distressing their partner. Yet in the study by Samuelsson et al. (2001), men recollected that the desire to preserve their role as a supporter continued even when they recognised that their partners wanted to see emotional vulnerability. In the case study exploring a psychologist's work with a prisoner who experienced a miscarriage, anger for instance was perceived as the only ‚Äòvalid‚Äô masculine response in face of distress and grief, particularly in a prison context where emotional vulnerability was perceived as a flaw. This has implications for men's families overall, with women noting that they could not turn to their partners for support if they feared responses of anger and blame, leading to martial conflict. However, in other instances, positive growth in marriages was noted such as greater intimacy and mutual understanding as differences in grieving and coping styles were negotiated or reconciled over time.

Being supported by friends, family and society

Across the studies, men noted accounts of being ‚Äòoverlooked‚Äô not only by health professionals but also friends and family who would often only enquire about their partner's well‚Äêbeing. In Bonnette and Broom's (2012) study of 12 Australian men who experienced a still‚Äêbirth, disenfranchisement by others in society contributed to them perceiving their grief as being less legitimate than their partners. Men reported tension between being recognised as both a ‚Äòstrong‚Äô, supportive husband but also a vulnerable, grieving father. These conflicting but intertwined social positions and responsibilities can be a source of stress and turmoil, hindering men's willingness to request help from others. In contrast, the few men who received positive reinforcement from hospital staff, friends, family or employers, felt that their sense of loss was validated and enabled them to express their grief to others. This suggests that health professionals, usually being the first people to have contact with couples experiencing perinatal loss, have a role in validating men's grief experiences, which could potentially mitigate negative consequences in the future. Further support is suggested, particularly targeted toward men. However, what form of support men might find beneficial was not explored within the articles.

Impact upon future pregnancies

Coping with subsequent pregnancies

As mentioned earlier, all men had differing attachments to the loss. However, despite the discrepancies, consistent among men across the studies was that their ‚Äòinnocent, trusting approach to a new pregnancy had been lost forever‚Äô (Samuelsson et al. pp.128). In Meaney et al. (2017), five men expressed reluctance at considering another pregnancy in the month following a still‚Äêbirth due to their fears and anxieties for both their own and their partners‚Äô well‚Äêbeing. Perinatal loss has the potential to alter men's parental aspirations altogether; however, the articles did not discuss if having previous living children influenced this decision. Four studies explicitly addressed men's experiences of subsequent pregnancies after a perinatal loss. The experience of a past perinatal loss infiltrated every aspect of subsequent pregnancies. O'Leary (2005) explored couples‚Äô experiences of ultrasounds during a subsequent pregnancy and found that men were unprepared for memories of their previous loss to resurface during the ‚Äòseemingly routine exam‚Äô (pp. 192). Across the studies, men reported heightened feelings of anxiety and increased vigilance of both mother and the potential infant, along with hesitation at expecting a positive outcome. However, they felt unable to discuss this with their partners, causing some men to feel additional stress and isolation.

Positive growth and transformation

If a subsequent pregnancy was successful, positive personal growth could occur as men noted a newfound appreciation for the fatherhood experience and increased capacity to handle stressful life moments. Some men noted that they still remembered and tried to maintain a bond with their previous loss. However, in Abboud and Liamputtong's (2003) study, men chose to focus on their following, living children rather than ruminating on the past miscarriage (pp. 51).

The review has identified three broad themes which have been relevant to providing insight to men's understanding and perceptions of losing a potential child to miscarriage or still‚Äêbirth. Although men's feelings and intensity of grief were intrinsically linked to their perceptions of pregnancy and, in particular gestation, nevertheless perinatal loss had wider implications for men's psychological well‚Äêbeing, relationships and future plans for fatherhood. The review advocates further research into men's experiences of perinatal loss, and it is anticipated that by expanding such research we can identify potential avenues to support men throughout this process, improve health service delivery and ultimately enhance outcomes for all those who experience perinatal loss, regardless of their gender.





","Background: Perinatal loss is often considered an emotionally and physically trau-matic event for expectant parents. While there is strong evidence of its impact onwomen, limited research has independently explored men's lived experiences.Aim: This scoping review will examine current literature on the lived experiencesof men whose partner has experienced a still‚Äêbirth or miscarriage.Material and Methods: The scoping review identified relevant articles by system-atically searching through four electronic databases utilising a PRISMA searchstrategy. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to articles. The articles‚Äôreference lists were further scrutinised until no further articles that met the criteriawere located. Fifteen articles were located including 14 qualitative studies and onenon‚Äêpeer reviewed academic article. Articles were thematically analysed.Results: The review identified three major themes that are particularly pertinentto shaping the lived experiences of men whose partner has suffered a perinatalloss: (1) pregnancy attachment and the aftermath; (2) supporting their partner andbeing supported; and (3) impacts upon future pregnancies.Conclusion: Perinatal loss can have negative implications for men's psychologicaland social well‚Äêbeing. Across the studies men had different levels of attachmentsto the pregnancy, influencing their emotional responses to the loss. Men perceivedtheir primary role as being a supporter to their partners but received limited sup-port themselves. Men often reported that their safe and trusting attitudes towardpregnancy had forever changed. Further areas of research are recommended inhopes of enhancing support for men, and consequently their partners and fami-lies, who experience perinatal loss.","6",0,"6","Apolitical",4,1

Conspiratorial Beliefs and Cognitive Styles: An Integrated Look on Analytic Thinking, Critical Thinking, and Scientific Reasoning in Relation to (Dis)trust in Conspiracy Theories. Frontiers in Psychology, 12, 736838. https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.736838","The framework proposed (in section 2) integrates theoretical considerations on three distinct cognitive styles (analytic thinking, critical thinking and scientific reasoning), into an organized system (with concise definitions of terms, clear description of meanings, and delineated mutual relationships). It is consistent with past psychological research, while at the same time providing fresh insights on the following aspects:

‚Ä¢ The constructs: they can be thought of as nested within each other, with analytic thinking comprising the broadest set, and scientific reasoning as the narrowest and most specialized subset.

‚Ä¢ The heuristics: analytic thinking relies on the dispositions for slow and conscious processing of information, critical thinking on the dispositions and the metacognitive strategies for reliable decision making, while scientific reasoning on the advanced cognitive skills and competencies for problem solving.

‚Ä¢ The goals: analytic thinking is oriented toward unbiased and objective understanding of facts in daily situations, critical thinking toward reliable update of beliefs, while scientific reasoning toward updates of knowledge systems.

The overview on past research (in section 3) has revealed that the investigations have been: partial (because they explored the link between conspiratorial beliefs and separate cognitive styles in separate research contexts), sporadic (especially with regards to the research on the link with the critical thinking), or even accidental (especially with regards to the research on the link with the scientific reasoning). Furthermore, the investigations were predominantly cross-sectional and correlational, and therefore with limited ability to make conclusions on the causal inference. In addition, there has been little progress in standardizing methodology and empirical approaches across studies. For instance, most analyses in this area rely on self-reported measures (i.e., scales and questionnaires), and rarely on experimental designs (e.g., studies on cognitive biases and logical fallacies). While most of the studies employed quantitative analyses for assessment of results, the measurement of the variables (e.g., the conspiratorial beliefs) has been conducted on differing scales, and some of the scales had unknown psychometric properties.

Integrated theoretical considerations can serve as basis for a unified approach in empirical studies. Specifically, they can shape future psychological research to: (a) build models that will account for all presented variables; (b) conduct experiments with ecologic validity preferably outside of laboratory settings; (c) perform complex statistical analyses (e.g., hierarchical regressions and structural equation modeling) that explore mutual relations between all proposed variables and test the overall model. More realistic models and improved experimental designs can inspire future behavioral interventions in the fight against misinformation and conspiracy theories, by cultivating the capacity for analytic, critical and scientific thinking (van der Linden et al., 2020; Lewandowsky et al., 2021). This is especially relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic where millions across the globe are inundated by conspiracy theories that have been linked to engagement in non-normative prevention behaviors (Marinthe et al., 2020), decreased trust in government and lack of compliance with official public health recommendations (Freeman et al., 2020), or even engagement in risky and violent behaviors (Jolley and Paterson, 2020).

Emerging evidence regarding pandemic-related conspiratorial beliefs and various cognitive markers, suggests that: (a) they are positively linked with a group of cognitive biases, marked by an increased tendency to make premature conclusions (delivered on basis of low subjective probability estimates, lack of sufficient evidence, or even in the face of disconfirmatory evidence) (Kuhn et al., 2021); (b) they are negatively linked with scientific reasoning (ƒåavojov√° et al., 2020); and most importantly (c) they can be reduced by nudging individuals to consider accuracy of presented statements (Pennycook et al., 2020b). In this respect, strategies that aim to enhance rationality seem to have potential in reducing prevalence of conspiratorial beliefs. For example, asking participants to judge the accuracy of a piece of information (in order to secure more reliable analysis and enhanced analytical thinking), or to judge subjective importance of an information (in order to secure more accurate interpretation and enhance critical thinking), or just providing digital literacy tips (for improved scientific reasoning) have been shown to reduce the spread of COVID-19 misinformation (Epstein et al., 2021).
","The tendency to believe in conspiracy theories (implying secret and malevolent plots by scheming groups or individuals), incites growing decennial interest among psychological researchers (exploring the associated personality traits, worldviews and cognitive styles of people). The link between the conspiratorial beliefs and the cognitive styles remains of particular interest to scholars, requiring integrated theoretical considerations. This perspective article will focus on the relationship between the propensity to (dis)trust conspiracy theories and three cognitive styles: analytic thinking, critical thinking, and scientific reasoning. Analytic thinking (inclination toward slow and deliberate processing of information in a conscious effort to mitigate biases and reach objective understanding of facts), is a well-studied concept in the context of conspiratorial beliefs, while the negative mutual relationship seems well-evidenced. On the other hand, the evidence on the link with the critical thinking (readiness to consider, reason, appraise, review, and interpret facts to update existing beliefs) has only started to emerge in the last years. Finally, scientific reasoning (ability to apply principles of scientific inquiry to formulate, test, revise and update knowledge in accordance with new evidence), is the least studied of the three cognitive styles in relation to conspiracy theories. The present article will: (a) revise the (lack of) scientific consensus on the definitional and conceptual aspects (by providing theoretical framework); (b) summarize the state of the art on the subject (by providing overview of empirical evidence); (c) discuss directions for future research (especially in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic). An integrated perspective on the relationship between conspiratorial beliefs and cognitive styles of people, may serve to inspire future behavioral interventions.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Political",3,0

Another Look at Moral Foundations Theory: Do Authoritarianism and Social Dominance Orientation Explain Liberal-Conservative Differences in ‚ÄúMoral‚Äù Intuitions? Social Justice Research, 27(4), 413‚Äì431. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11211-014-0223-5","In a long string of publications, moral foundations theorists have staked out a strong normative position that so-called ""conservative"" intuitions associated with the valuation of ingroup loyalty, obedience to authority, and enforcement of purity concerns are every bit as valid, well-intentioned, and morally defensible as so-called ""liberal"" intuitions associated with the valuation of fairness and avoidance of harm (e.g., Graham et al., 2009; Haidt, 2008, 2012; Haidt & Graham, 2007; Haidt et al., 2009). These authors have explicitly distinguished their approach from theories of moral development as well as theories of authoritarianism and social dominance orientation on the grounds that their approach is more sympathetic to politically conservative interests and concerns (e.g., Duarte et al., 2014; Haidt, 2012; Haidt & Bjorklund, 2008; Haidt & Graham, 2007; Shermer, 2011). In addition, Haidt (2008, 2012) has encouraged Democrats to make more frequent use in their political campaigns of ""moral"" appeals based on ingroup, authority, and purity themes. The results of our investigation suggest that the moral valuation of ingroup loyalty, obedience to authority, and purity concerns is associated with attitudes and belief systems that may be considered prejudicial and therefore morally unsavory (to return to the taste bud metaphor). We have shown that liberal-conservative differences in the endorsement of these three ""binding"" intuitions may be attributable, at least in part, to the fact that conservatives tend to be higher than liberals on authoritarianism. Furthermore, liberal-conservative differences in the endorsement of fairness and avoidance of harm are attributable to the fact that liberals tend to be lower than conservatives on social dominance orientation (see also Milojev et al., 2014). The fact that these two types of moral concerns have opposite effects on intergroup hostility and support for discrimination against foreigners and immigrants raises questions about the assumption that ""binding"" and ""individualizing"" (or perhaps ""humanistic"" concerns) should be treated as operating on the same moral plane, objectively speaking (see also Jacobsin, 2008; Jost, 2012; Nagel, 2012).

### **Implications for the Study of Moral Psychology**  
There are two highly divergent ways of thinking about the implications of our findings for the study of moral psychology. First, one could make a critical argument that‚Äîgiven the extent to which past research links authoritarianism and social dominance orientation with bigotry, prejudice, discrimination, intolerance, and other forms of intergroup hostility (e.g., Altemeyer, 1996, 1998, 2006; Napier & Jost, 2008; Pratto et al., 1994; Sidanius & Pratto, 1999; Whitley & Lee, 2000)‚Äî""liberal"" values of justice and care are on stronger ethical ground than ""conservative"" values that prioritize the ingroup, obedience to authority, and purity. At some level, our evidence would appear to undercut entreaties by moral foundations theorists to consider ingroup, authority, and purity concerns as ""moral (rather than immoral or amoral),"" at least according to most conventionally accepted (and non-vacuous) definitions of these terms. Although many people may express the belief that loyalty to the ingroup, obedience to authority, and the enforcement of purity standards are morally good or justifiable (usually in the absence of value conflicts or trade-offs involving fairness or avoidance of harm), the possibility remains that, objectively speaking, they are not (Nagel, 2012). Our results suggest that liberal-conservative differences in ""moral"" intuitions such as these are attributable not to defensible moral principles per se but to personality dispositions associated with authoritarianism and social dominance orientation.

A second possibility, which is more in accord with the meta-theoretical assumptions of moral foundations theory, is that these dispositions are ""moral"" simply because (some) people believe them to be relevant for moral judgment. Indeed, moral foundations theorists might even want (or be obliged, for the sake of consistency) to argue that authoritarianism and social dominance are themselves moral intuitions or orientations. Duarte et al. (2014) seem to suggest, for instance, that those who score high in authoritarianism and social dominance orientation are no more guilty of prejudice and discrimination than those who score low on these variables. There is a problem, however, with defining the moral domain in purely subjective (or descriptive) terms and assuming, as moral relativists do, that ""morality is in the eye of the beholder."" Such an approach risks opening up the domain of morality to virtually anything, ""no matter how heinous,"" as Jacobsin (2008) observed. One cannot help but wonder what it would take to be refused admission to the ever-broadening tent of ""morality"" if characteristics associated with authoritarianism and social dominance are to be ushered in (Jost, 2012).  

We think that it would be more sensible and accurate to conclude simply that a number of morally irrelevant (i.e., amoral) psychological factors (such as feelings of disgust occasioned by ""fart sprays"") lead people to render harsher moral judgments, including greater condemnation of homosexual behavior, than they otherwise would (e.g., Helzer & Pizarro, 2011). This conclusion would be consistent with Haidt‚Äôs (2001) view that moral judgments serve as post hoc rationalizations of emotional reactions. However, it is inconsistent with the claim that morality (in anything like the same sense) is about ""living in a sanctified and noble way"" (Haidt, 2008) or that ""morality dignifies and elevates"" (see Jacobsin, 2008, p. 219).

### **Caveats and Limitations**  
Because we administered the same self-report instruments developed by Haidt et al. (2009) and Graham et al. (2011), we cannot rule out the possibility that correlations between authoritarianism and endorsement of ""binding foundations"" are inflated because of conceptual overlap in the wording of items (e.g., ""respect [for] traditions and heritage of the country""). Given that the instruments used to measure moral concerns were developed by moral foundations theorists to operationalize their constructs of interest, however, our methodological approach seems appropriate for testing the hypothesis that authoritarianism and social dominance help to explain liberal-conservative differences in moral intuitions in the very ways in which these intuitions have been conceptualized and operationalized in the relevant research literature.  

Another potential limitation of our study is that it fails to demonstrate that ingroup, authority, and purity concerns are associated with immoral behavior‚Äîjust as previous research on moral foundations theory has failed to demonstrate that these concerns are associated with moral behavior. Future research would do well to investigate the effects of endorsing specific moral intuitions on behavior that violates objective moral standards (e.g., lying, cheating, stealing, or engaging in discriminatory conduct in the absence of compelling ethical justifications for these behaviors). The research literature pertaining to authoritarianism and social dominance would lead one to predict that those who embrace ""binding foundations"" would be more likely than those who reject them to engage in exploitative or abusive treatment of others, especially when it comes to individuals and groups that question authority and those who violate standards of purity (e.g., gay men and lesbians). Altemeyer (1998), for instance, observed that authoritarianism and social dominance orientation not only predicted a wide variety of ethnic prejudices but also a tendency to downplay sexual harassment and, in the case of social dominance orientation, relatively high scores on the ""Exploitive Manipulative Amoral Dishonesty Scale,"" which contains items such as ""There is really no such thing as ‚Äòright‚Äô and ‚Äòwrong.‚Äô It all boils down to what you can get away with.""","Moral foundations theorists propose that the moral domain should include not only ""liberal"" ethics of justice and care but also ostensibly ""conservative"" concerns about the virtues of ingroup loyalty, obedience to authority, and enforcement of purity standards. This proposal clashes with decades of research in political psychology connecting the latter set of characteristics to ""the authoritarian personality."" We demonstrate that liberal-conservative differences in moral intuitions are statistically mediated by authoritarianism and social dominance orientation, so that conservatives‚Äô greater valuation of ingroup, authority, and purity concerns is attributable to higher levels of authoritarianism, whereas liberals‚Äô greater valuation of fairness and harm avoidance is attributable to lower levels of social dominance. We also find that ingroup, authority, and purity concerns are positively associated with intergroup hostility and support for discrimination, whereas concerns about fairness and harm avoidance are negatively associated with these variables. These findings might lead some to question the wisdom and appropriateness of efforts to ""broaden"" scientific conceptions of morality in such a way that preferences based on authoritarianism and social dominance are treated as moral‚Äîrather than amoral or even immoral‚Äîand suggest that the explicit goal of incorporating conservative ideology into the study of moral psychology (in order to increase ideological diversity) may lead researchers astray.","3",0,"3","Political",2,0

Psychological Inquiry, 27(1), 40‚Äì45. https://doi.org/10.1080/1047840X.2016.1115713","Last year I cowrote an essay with Greg Lukianoff titled ‚ÄúThe Coddling of the American Mind‚Äù (Lukianoff & Haidt, 2015). Lukianoff and I analyzed several new concepts that have been spreading rapidly around the academy‚Äîbut almost nowhere else in American society. The two most colorful are ‚ÄúTrigger warnings‚Äù (warnings given to students before professors assign readings that might reactivate painful memories in survivors of trauma) and ‚Äúmicroaggressions‚Äù (words, questions, or even facial expressions that have the effect‚Äîoften unintended‚Äîof making another person feel marginalized, different, or excluded). A search for these terms on Google Trends shows that they were barely mentioned before 2012 but have been rising rapidly in popularity since late 2013.

These terms are part of a new conceptual package that includes all of the older concepts long referred to as ‚Äúpolitical correctness‚Äù but with greatly expanded notions of harm, trauma, mental illness, vulnerability, and harassment. These concepts seem to have expanded in just the way that Nick Haslam (this issue) describes‚Äîhorizontally, to take in new kinds of cases (such as adding the reading of novels to the list of traumatizing activities), and vertically, to take in ever less extreme versions of older cases (as is made explicit by the prefix ‚Äúmicro‚Äù in the word ‚Äúmicroaggression‚Äù). In this conceptually augmented political correctness, the central idea seems to be that many college students are so fragile that institutions and right-thinking people must all work together to protect vulnerable individuals from exposure to words and ideas that could damage them in a lasting way. If this protection requires banning certain speakers from campus, or punishing student newspapers that publish opinions that upset the dominant campus sensibility, then so be it.

But the reactions to the ‚ÄúCoddling‚Äù article‚Äîin essays, blog posts, and commentary on the original post‚Äîhas revealed a large generational gap. As far as I can tell, the vast majority of Americans older than 40, including progressives, and including progressive professors, dislike the illiberal tendencies of the new political correctness. They do not share the view that college students must be shielded from words, books, and visiting speakers. These older progressives value freedom of speech to such an extent that they oppose efforts to shut down student newspapers or shout down professors or visiting speakers. President Obama himself recently spoke out against ‚Äúcoddling‚Äù and in favor of vigorous cross-partisan debate on campus (see quotes in Haidt, 2015). There has been hardly any published criticism of the ‚ÄúCoddling‚Äù article, but what little pushback there has been has come almost exclusively from current college students and from humanities professors younger than 35 (e.g., Manne, 2015).

Why is this? Why has this new and expansive sense of student fragility spread so rapidly, but only among millennials who are currently living or working on college campuses? Lukianoff and I tried to explain the recent spread of trigger warnings and microaggression theory by examining broad historical trends, such as increases in protective parenting that began in the 1980s, and we examined more recent changes in federal laws that pressured universities to overpolice language use on campus. But Haslam‚Äôs explanation of concept creep provides a large and crucial missing piece of the story. In this article I expand upon a point that Haslam (this issue) raised only briefly at the end of his target article: Concept creep has happened primarily to concepts related to a left-liberal moral agenda. As he noted on p. 14:

‚ÄúThe concept creep phenomenon broadens moral concern in a way that aligns with a liberal social agenda by defining new kinds of experience as harmful and new classes of people as harmed, and it identifies these people as needful of care and protection.‚Äù

I position concept creep within the recent historical trend of rising political polarization, particularly ‚Äúaffective partisan polarization,‚Äù which refers to the increasing hostility felt by partisans toward people on the other side. I tell this story in three graphs. Together, the trends in these graphs can explain why concepts of trauma and victimhood have undergone such rapid expansion on university campuses and among psychologists. In brief, the loss of political diversity in many universities‚Äîand in psychology in particular‚Äîat a time of rising cross-partisan hostility has amplified the already powerful process of motivated reasoning. Concepts are morphing to become ever more useful to ‚Äúintuitive prosecutors‚Äù (Tetlock, 2002), who are prosecuting their enemies in the culture war.                                                                                                                                                                         Graph 1: Political Polarization Is Rising in Congress
The U.S. Congress went through a period of historically low polarization from the 1920s through the 1970s, as shown in Figure 1, which plots the degree to which a legislator‚Äôs votes on major issues can be predicted if all one knows about that legislator is his or her placement on the left‚Äìright dimension. Ideology has become steadily more powerful as a predictor of voting, particularly since the 1980s. Before the 80s, politics was more flexible; the existence of conservative Democrats (mostly in the South) and liberal Republicans (mostly in the Northeast and Northwest) made it much easier than it is today to create bipartisan coalitions in support of major projects and reforms. But for a variety of reasons (described in Haidt & Abrams, 2015), the parties began to shuffle and purify themselves in the 1970s so that by the 1990s the Democrats had become the liberal party and Republicans were the conservative party. Crossovers, and even moderates, were less and less welcome, particularly in the Republican Party.

Graph 2: Affective Partisan Polarization Is Increasing Among Americans
As the two parties were sorting themselves along the left‚Äìright axis, what it meant to be a Republican or a Democrat changed, and hostility to the increasingly purified and increasingly extreme ‚Äúother side‚Äù intensified. Figure 2 shows data from the American National Election Survey, from the ‚Äúfeeling thermometer‚Äù section in which a representative sample of Americans are asked to rate how warm or cold they feel toward various groups and institutions in American society. The top two lines show that Americans have held steady in their generally positive ratings of their own party. The bottom two lines show that there has been a steady drop in how they feel about the other side. It is interesting to note that in the 1980s, cross-partisan ratings were only a little bit below 50‚Äînot very ‚Äúcold.‚Äù But the decline began to accelerate after 2000, particularly for Democrats responding to the Republican party of George W. Bush and the war in Iraq. The net effect has been a sharp rise in public expressions of anger and incivility, at the elite level (e.g., a Republican congressman shouting ‚ÄúYou lie!‚Äù to President Obama) as well as at the mass level (as seen in populist movements such as the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street).

What effect might this national trend of increasing cross-partisan hostility have had on university life? How might it have changed psychology in particular?

Graph 3: Psychology Is Becoming Politically Purified
In 2011, I gave a talk at the annual meeting of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology in which I argued that social psychology was becoming a ‚Äútribal moral community‚Äù bound together by moral commitments to social justice and progressive ideals. I described ways in which the absence of conservatives in the field made it harder to do good research. I was later joined by four other social psychologists (Jose Duarte, Jarret Crawford, Lee Jussim, and Phil Tetlock), as well as one sociologist (Charlotta Stern) in laying out a more formal and complete argument. Our article (Duarte et al., 2015) was titled ‚ÄúPolitical Diversity Will Improve Social Psychological Science.‚Äù

In that article, Charlotta Stern pulled together all extant published information on the political identities of academic or research-oriented psychologists, and she plotted all available data points on a single graph. The graph, reprinted as Figure 3, stunned us. We had not realized just how rapidly psychology had changed in the 1990s when the Greatest Generation (which had some political diversity in it) retired just as the Baby Boomers were coming to dominate the field. The diamonds on the left side of the graph represent psychologists‚Äô recollections of which party they voted for in prior presidential elections, as assessed in the early 1960s (McClintock, Spaulding, & Turner, 1965). The ratio of voting for Democrats versus Republicans mostly ranges from 2:1 to 4:1, and a similar ratio was found for self-reports of being liberal versus conservative‚Äî4:1‚Äîas late as 1990. But after 1990, whether the question is party preference or ideology (liberal‚Äìconservative), the ratio skyrockets. Psychology is rapidly purging itself of all political diversity.  In Duarte et al. (2015) we offered a variety of steps that psychology can take. The essential first step is to examine why psychology is so committed to diversity. We have a highly refined set of concepts for describing the benefits of diversity. We have argued since the 1980s that all institutions, organizations, and industries should embrace diversity, not in order to right past wrongs but to make themselves better.

We should embrace our own teachings. It would take only small changes to our policies and our thinking to recognize that the kind of diversity psychology (and the rest of the academy) most desperately needs is diversity of viewpoints. (For more on the benefits of viewpoint diversity, please visit www.HeterodoxAcademy.org)","Stereotype accuracy is one of the largest and most replicable effects in all of social psychology. It took social psychology nearly a century to recognize that not only had it been declaring stereotypes to be inaccurate on the basis of little data, but once the data started to come in, to accept that this data often (though not always) demonstrated moderate to high stereotype accuracy. This resistance to the data has constituted a significant impediment to understanding the existence, causes, and consequences of both stereotype accuracy and inaccuracy.

This chapter is divided into three major sections. The first (History of Obstacles to Social Psychology Accepting Its Own Data on Stereotype Accuracy) reviews some of the obstacles social psychology has faced with respect to accepting that stereotype (in)accuracy is an empirical question, and that the empirical data do not justify assumptions, definitions, or declarations that stereotypes are inaccurate. The second (The Empirical Assessment of Stereotype (In)Accuracy) summarizes what is now an impressive body of literature assessing the (in)accuracy of racial, gender, age, national, ethnic, political, and other stereotypes. The third (Stereotype (In)Accuracy: Knowns, Unknowns, and Emerging Controversies) summarizes broad and emerging patterns in that body of literature, highlighting unresolved controversies, and identifying important directions for future research.","5",0,"5","Political",5,0

Bound to the group and blinded by the leader: Ideological leader‚Äìfollower dynamics in a trust economic game. Royal Society Open Science, 6(9), 182023. https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.182023","The TG dynamics between political leaders and their devoted followers occur on a daily basis. Leaders usually assume the role of trustworthy subjects by offering economic incentives (investments, credits, and other financial benefits) to their trusting followers. Additionally, the TG dynamics are reflected in the fact that each voter is also a taxpayer (i.e., trustor), while political leaders with governmental experience are decision-makers (i.e., trustees). They can choose to spend the budget on societal improvements (thus returning the trust and behaving trustworthily) or for their own benefit (thus behaving in an untrustworthy manner). Our approach allowed us to shed light on important aspects of these voter‚Äìleader interactions. We demonstrated that when it comes to supporting voters and their perception of an in-group political leader, bias may not manifest at the very beginning, but it can certainly become evident towards the end of a trust-based economic interaction. Specifically, we observed a clear difference in overall behavior between our two experimental groups when playing with an in-group/out-group political leader (SB) compared to playing with a neutral control (PA). Namely, we found that while opposing voters (in our case, the LW-group) adjusted the amount of their investment according to the behavior of both SB and PA, supporting voters (the RW-group) failed to adjust when playing with SB but did so when playing with PA. The lack of adjustment in the group who played with their own leader occurred despite their explicit awareness of his behavior, as confirmed by the post-experimental evaluation of the overall behavior of the trustee.

Our central finding, related to the lack of adjustment in the group who played with their un/trustworthy political leader, provides evidence beyond the existing literature on intergroup ideological bias (i.e., the automatic preference for the members of one‚Äôs own political group), guided by the preference for one‚Äôs own political leader. It also supports the so-called epistemic spillover, a flawed heuristic of trusting like-minded political figures in non-political matters (in this case, economic trust decisions in an interactive game). Moreover, our findings suggest mechanisms at the core of ideological intergroup biases, highlighting two important dimensions, especially prominent in RW-voters: (i) strong group-binding moral values and (ii) respect for in-group authority figures (i.e., powerful leaders). Studies provide ample neural and behavioral evidence that voters from both sides of the political spectrum are not bound by cold rationality when making judgments about their political peers. Our results expand on previous literature showing that, at least on an explicit level, both groups of trustors were able to discriminate the behavior of the trustee. They could discern whether the trustee reciprocated their offers, as indexed by the lack of significant differences between the groups in the assessment of both characters (PA and SB) through post-experimental evaluations. However, we observed clear differences in the economic behavior of voters who played with their in-group leader, as indicated by the significant triple interaction (Group √ó Trustee √ó Condition) in the mixed-model analysis.

Furthermore, a more in-depth analysis of moral values and social attitudes in our sample of voters (obtained via PCA on a battery of self-reported surveys) suggests that stronger admiration for the authority of one‚Äôs leader and strong loyalty to one‚Äôs group could be leading mechanisms for the emergence of bias. These results align with Social Identity Theory regarding expressive partisan identity, the Moral Foundation Theory (MFT), and the Right-Wing Authoritarianism Theory (RWA). According to MFT, the five basic moral foundations (harm/care, fairness/reciprocity, in-group/loyalty, respect/authority, and purity/sanctity) collapse into two superordinate foundations. The first two values are labeled as individualizing foundations (oriented towards protection and fair treatment of individuals), while the remaining three are binding foundations (focused on the protection of the group, collectives, and institutions). The binding foundations include (i) patriotism and self-sacrifice for one‚Äôs group (in-group loyalty), (ii) concerns about the importance of social order, traditions, and respect for leadership (respect/authority), and (iii) the prevalence of spiritual over carnal nature (purity/sanctity). Political identity largely shapes moral foundations, with LW-voters endorsing individualizing foundations and RW-voters ascribing equal or higher moral relevance to binding foundations. The latter group of values has been examined in the context of immorality, such as blind obedience and stigma. In our experiment, the observed lack of modulation in trust-based economic behavior towards the conservative leader was stronger in individuals who scored higher on the well-described Group Binding dimension. This dimension is built upon the binding set of moral values (e.g., loyalty to one‚Äôs group, respect for authority figures, and concern for religious purity) and RW-authoritarian social attitudes (e.g., authoritarian submission, tolerance for authoritarian aggression, and conformism as defined in the RW authoritarianism scale).

These findings provide additional evidence supporting the claim that liberal‚Äìconservative differences in moral intuitions could be due to authoritarianism, meaning that conservatives‚Äô greater valuation of their group, traditions, conventions, and norms is attributable to their general proneness to authority figures. Indeed, in our experiment, strong partisan affiliation emanated through the persona of a charismatic, dominant leader, even if incidental. Schilke et al. have demonstrated that the power-disadvantaged are inclined to perceive power-holders positively, even when such a belief is not supported by reliable evidence. Such conclusions hold particularly true for individuals who show higher awareness of hierarchical arrangements and attribute greater importance to authority figures, as is the case with RW-partisans. The observed behavior of supporting voters when playing with their influential leader aligns with our earlier findings on the gaze-attracting power of SB. Namely, the RW-group was less able to suppress the automatic tendency to follow SB‚Äôs gaze in comparison to the LW-group, an effect linked to his political power. Further understanding may come from studies using advanced tools that allow more realistic interaction with a leader (such as immersive virtual reality) and provide more insightful computational models (via machine learning) or neurophysiological correlates (via fMRI) for data analysis and interpretation.

Voters can ""use the perceived credibility of political figures as a heuristic to guide their evaluations"" of what is right or wrong and decisions of whether to trust or not, an effect known as epistemic spillover. Our previous studies have shown that the perceived similarity between voters and leaders can influence even basic cognitive processes, such as attentional gaze capture. Our current experiment provides more direct evidence, showing that voters‚Äô shared political ideology with an in-group political leader ""spills over"" into their economic decision-making processes in a trust-based economic game (i.e., a non-political context). The study raises several key issues regarding individuals and group dynamics. The first is the extent to which trust towards a political leader is defined by voter‚Äìleader interchange. The second is the extent to which voter‚Äìleader interchange relies on situational factors, in our case, an online and dynamic version of the TG. The third is the extent to which trust towards a political leader is determined by dispositional factors, such as voters‚Äô moral values and social attitudes, leading to its sustenance and behavioral resistance to change. Our results show that, depending on the Group Binding dimension, the voter‚Äìleader relation embedded in trustor‚Äìtrustee economic interaction can either be a dynamic construct influenced by situational attributions or a fairly static construct shaped by dispositional attributions. Importantly, trust in voter‚Äìleader relations can be enlightening for some but blinding for others.

One might expect ideological bias to lead to irrational behavior, and supporting voters (RW-group) behaved in line with this reasoning, failing to adjust to the un/trustworthy behavior of their in-group leader, Berlusconi. Conversely, opposing voters (LW-group) behaved rationally despite ideological bias, adjusting their economic behavior to the un/trustworthy behavior of the out-group leader Berlusconi. However, the behavior of the RW-group towards an in-group leader does not necessarily imply a symmetrical response from the LW-group towards a hypothetical in-group leader. The ideological asymmetry remains an open question, and we strongly support replicating the experiment in a nation with a strong LW-leader. In Italy, no single LW-leader embodies all the qualities necessary for comparison with Berlusconi. Future longitudinal studies across different geopolitical contexts with leaders of similar political presence, leadership experience, and media exposure could help address the extent of in-group influence on followers.

In conclusion, by investigating direct voter‚Äìleader trust-based economic exchange, our study provides novel empirical evidence that the power of political leaders over their electors does not rely merely on their authority but also on biased perceptions of their trustworthiness. These findings contribute to an advanced understanding of media campaigns and electoral outcomes and have the potential to help improve democracy in modern societies.I do not believe it is problematic when an academic field leans left, as psychology did before the 1990s. In a free society, few fields will end up with perfectly proportional representation by politics, gender, race, or other criteria. As long as there are sure to be some conservatives (or women, or African Americans) to review papers, speak at symposia, and otherwise challenge the biases and prejudices of the dominant group, the scientific process of institutionalized questioning can function. But when the ratio of liberals to conservatives rises above a certain point (5:1? 10:1?), we get a phase change. People start to assume that everyone in the room shares their politics. They start making jokes, from the lectern, about conservatives. They create a hostile climate, and the few remaining nonliberals begin to hide their views. Nonliberal graduate students and assistant professors are particularly vulnerable to discrimination, as many have told me (see their stories at Haidt, 2011).

In the process of writing our political diversity paper, we learned that psychology is not unique in undergoing a political purification process with rising hostility toward political minorities. Most fields in the social sciences and humanities seem to be experiencing these trends (Klein & Stern, 2009). This makes sense if the rising cross-party hostility shown in Figure 2 is a national trend.

Creeping Concepts for an Intensifying Culture War

Looking at the three figures and then returning to Haslam‚Äôs (this issue) article, we can now see the underlying processes that might be driving concepts to the left. I don‚Äôt need to review for this readership the power and ubiquity of motivated reasoning and the confirmation bias. I just add that these processes‚Äîwhich are usually studied in individuals acting on self-serving motives‚Äîoften become much stronger when individuals are embedded in groups that are locked in combat with other groups (for a review, see Haidt, 2012, Chap. 4). Intense tribalism is fundamentally incompatible with open mindedness and the search for truth because changing your mind‚Äîor merely acknowledging nuance‚Äîbecomes treason.

So let us imagine ourselves hovering over any great American research university at any time in the last 15 years, looking down and observing as a few hundred faculty members in the humanities and social sciences go about their work. Their academic fields are becoming more politically homogeneous, and the attitudes of everyone around them are becoming gradually more hostile toward conservatives and Republicans. A large minority of these professors directly study politically charged topics such as race, gender, power, and marginalization. How might their scholarship be influenced by the trends shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3?

Tetlock (2002) summarized a great deal of research on social cognition by saying that people sometimes become ‚Äúintuitive prosecutors,‚Äù with a ‚Äúprosecutorial mindset‚Äù that can get switched on and off as needed. He said that we often strive to be fair, as prosecutors, but he noted how ‚Äúblatantly biased ingroups are toward outgroups‚Äù (p. 461). If we allow that many academics studying politically charged topics might, at least sometimes, be in ‚Äúintuitive prosecutor‚Äù mode, then we can expect them to make three kinds of conceptual moves that would be helpful in prosecuting the perceived enemies of social justice (i.e., conservatives, and members of ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù groups). Maximize the victim class. A good prosecutor will strive to recruit ever more groups to register complaints against the accused. This might explain the ever-lengthening list of groups and identities that fall under the protection of diversity and inclusion policies. This is a form of horizontal creep in the concept of victimhood.

Maximize the damages. A prosecutor has a stronger case if she can show that the damages done to victims are far graver than they appear at first sight. Thus scholars from across the academy have an incentive to find new ways in which members of allegedly victimized groups are harmed by current practices. This prosecutorial imperative might explain the creeping concepts of ‚Äúmarginalization‚Äù and ‚Äúexclusion‚Äù (horizontal creep), as well as the constant lowering of the criteria (vertical creep) for harm in general and trauma in particular that Haslam described in his essay.

Minimize the defendant‚Äôs defenses. In criminal cases, most serious charges require mens rea‚Äîa ‚Äúguilty mind.‚Äù You can‚Äôt convict someone of murder or assault if the harm was entirely unintentional. But if you develop a new legal theory that removes the need for mens rea, you can vastly increase your conviction rate. This is one of the central innovations of microaggression theory. Microaggressions are defined as ‚Äúbrief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional [emphasis added], that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults toward people of color‚Äù (Sue et al., 2007, p. 271). Indeed, Haslam specifically notes that many creeping concepts, including abuse, bullying, and discrimination, have shed their older requirements for mens rea, requiring only a subjective assessment by the apparent victim. Unlike courts of law, in academic settings a lack of intent‚Äîor even the presence of good intentions‚Äîis no longer a valid defense against charges of racism, sexism, or other crimes. All that matters is that a member of a protected group felt marginalized. This is why we are increasingly hearing from left-leaning professors who write essays with titles such as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a liberal professor, and my liberal students terrify me‚Äù (Schlosser, 2015).

To sum up, if an increasingly left-leaning academy is staffed by people who are increasingly hostile to conservatives, then we can expect that their concepts will shift, via motivated scholarship, in ways that will help them and their allies (e.g., university administrators) to prosecute and condemn conservatives. We can expect academic concepts to ‚Äúcreep‚Äù in ways that increase the number of victims and the damages those victims suffer, and in ways that make it ever harder for anyone to defend themselves against ugly moral charges. Such politically motivated scholarship may sometimes originate in humanities departments rather than in psychology, but it draws heavily on psychological concepts and research, and it feeds back into the six streams of creeping psychological research that Haslam (this issue) reviews. 
Rising Danger for Psychology

Haslam (this issue) lists a number of dangers to psychology from left-ward concept creep. I just want to make Haslam‚Äôs warning more vivid by asking readers to imagine a situation in which the politics is reversed (see Tetlock, 2005, on turnabout tests).

Suppose that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was traditionally a right-leaning organization, like most law enforcement organizations. Suppose conservatives outnumbered liberals by about three to one from its founding in 1908 through the 1990s. But suppose that during the administration of George W. Bush the agency began to lean much further to the right. After the 9/11 attacks, the agency‚Äôs culture became extremely hostile to liberals and Democrats, who were widely associated with the gravest threats to the nation. By 2012 the ratio of conservatives to liberals was 14 to 1 (as in Figure 3). Do you suppose this transformation might affect the way the FBI did its job, or would you trust the agency‚Äôs professionalism to keep politics out of law enforcement?

Might the agency shift its resources toward conservative priorities, such as fighting terrorism and moral decay, while ignoring liberal priorities such as abortion clinic bombings, civil rights infringements, and environmental crimes? And might we begin to see law enforcement concepts creeping to the right, such that more and more citizens fall under suspicion of entitlement cheating, abetting illegal immigration, or subverting American values? Perhaps we‚Äôd even see the creation of brand-new legal concepts such as ‚Äúmicro-treasons,‚Äù defined as ‚Äúbrief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative attitudes toward the United States of America.‚Äù

Most important: How would you feel about this new FBI? Would you trust it and believe its pronouncements? Would you support its continued operational independence, or would you want Congress to demand reform?

Psychology (like almost all of the other social sciences and humanities) has a serious problem. Haslam (this issue) shows us that our concepts are creeping to the left in ways that make psychology ever more appealing to the left and ever less appealing to the right. I have shown that our membership is creeping to the left as well, as part of a broad national trend of rising affective polarization. Will we just sit back and let our field drift, or will we take charge and try to reverse these trends?
","Understanding the dynamics of trustworthiness in ideological contexts could influence human societies, affect electoral campaigns, and ultimately impact democracy. We tested trust behavior towards political leaders in a sample of 121 opposing/supporting voters assigned as trustors in an iterative trust game (TG). In two experiments, a famous Italian conservative leader (i.e., Silvio Berlusconi) or a famous non-politician were used as trustees in a predefined un/trustworthy TG, while trustors believed that mathematical algorithms reproduced the trustee‚Äôs real behavior. Results revealed that, depending on the group, voters either relied on the situation and adjusted to the behavior of the out-group leader (in our case, left-wing voters) or on their disposition for group-loyalty with respect for authority, thus failing to adjust to the behavior of the in-group leader (in our case, right-wing voters). Our findings suggest that (i) complex voter‚Äìleader relations in politics are reflected in the simple trustor‚Äìtrustee financial interactions from behavioral economics, and (ii) being bound to one‚Äôs group and one‚Äôs leader may affect the trust economic decisions of the followers.","4",0,"4","Political",6,1

Nature Human Behaviour, 6(3), 392‚Äì403. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01258-7","Across a large sample of respondents from 26 countries and two studies, estimating self-reported political orientation and voting intentions for political parties, we found support for consistent relations between political orientation and the propensity to believe in conspiracies. Respondents at the extreme ends of the political continuum expressed more pronounced beliefs that the world is governed by secret forces operating in the dark. We had proposed two (not necessarily mutually exclusive) explanations of this pattern: (political) control deprivation and worldview consistency. In the former case, conspiracy mentality is a reaction to the fact that one‚Äôs political ideas are not part of the political mainstream, whereas in the latter, one‚Äôs general outlook on the world also determines one‚Äôs political preferences. In line with the (political) control deprivation idea, supporters of parties not included in the government harbored higher levels of conspiracy mentality in both studies. Crucially, however, controlling for whether one‚Äôs preferred party is in power still leaves the quadratic effect of political orientation intact in both studies, thus allowing the speculation that individual levels of conspiracy mentality are at least partly associated with one‚Äôs general worldview.

Which aspects of extreme political ideologies and conspiracy mentality overlap and thus create such a U-shaped relation? One prominent candidate is their Manichaean view of a black-and-white world. Conspiracy allegations typically blame a few powerful, evil people for prioritizing their own sinister goals over the welfare of all others. Likewise, identifiable ""evil"" groups take a prominent role in the rhetoric of both extreme right-wing parties (for example, Muslims or foreigners) as well as extreme left-wing parties (for example, bank and hedge fund managers or the European Union). By dividing the social realm into clearly antagonistic forces of good and evil, complexity is reduced and taking a firm (and moral) position is comparatively easier. Although this seems to align well with the finding that belief in simple political solutions is a common denominator of both political extremism and belief in conspiracy theories, the robust association even after controlling for education does not strongly support this as the relevant link.

As an important caveat, however, we have not tested the worldview hypothesis directly. Rather, we set up a critical test of whether the observed pattern may be reducible to political control deprivation (that is, not feeling represented by the parties in power). It has survived this potential falsification and therefore remains a plausible account to explain the residual connection between political orientation and conspiracy mentality. Other explanations are conceivable as well. Future research may further elucidate this connection and test the worldview hypothesis more directly. 

Our findings add a further nuance to the observation of conspiracy mentality at both ends of the political spectrum. While conspiracy mentality peaks for supporters of parties that are either seen as extreme left-wing or right-wing in general, it is specifically the case for supporters of parties that are socially right-wing and do not endorse liberal values. Supporters of extreme left-wing parties do not exhibit particularly strong conspiracy mentality, to the extent that these parties take a liberal stance on social issues. This aligns with observations of a connection between conspiracy beliefs and variables tapping into non-egalitarian attitudes such as binding foundations. The fact that there is a strong connection between social conservatism rather than economic conservatism and conspiracy mentality also aligns well with the presumed function of conspiracy beliefs. Endorsing conspiracies results from the need to manage threat and uncertainty by creating an illusion of control and clear answers. Social (rather than economic) conservatism has been connected to these same needs, speaking further to the intimate connection between conspiracy mentality and social (but not economic) right-wing political orientation.

Across both studies, our findings strongly corroborate the notion that ""conspiracy theories are for losers."" We have interpreted this through the lens of political control deprivation (higher conspiracy mentality because one lost the vote) or as a reaction to power. We want to caution, however, against ignoring potential reverse causation. It is certainly feasible that the experience of losing an election increases conspiracy mentality, but as well or instead, anti-mainstream parties that a priori have very low chances of winning an election may appeal to conspiracy believers (because of their populist anti-elite rhetoric or because they can quench a need for uniqueness). In Study 1, respondents indicated which party they intended to vote for, whereas in Study 2, they reported which party they had voted for in the most recent elections (thus constituting a more direct test). Comparing the beta weights of the two models suggests that the association was 52% larger in Study 2 than in Study 1, and confidence intervals did not overlap. Although one would expect this pattern if the experience of having lost an election does indeed have an effect above the preference for non-mainstream parties, it does not offer proof. Strong tests of the causal direction can only be conducted on longitudinal data.

In an exploratory fashion, we also examined whether diverging patterns for political orientation depended on whether one‚Äôs preferred party was in power. We found remarkably strong support for this speculation, showing that, in fact, control deprivation was accompanied by an increase in conspiracy mentality almost exclusively for the (extreme) political right. This finding resonates with an ideological asymmetry observed in the US context, whereby conservatives‚Äô trust in the government is more contingent on whether the president shares their ideology than liberals‚Äô trust in government. Likewise, not being in power was accompanied by strong generalized anti-establishment beliefs (that is, conspiracy mentality) for the political right but not the left.

Although not the focus of the present research, our data also provided further support for greater conspiracy mentality among people with lower levels of education. According to previous analyses, low formal education is associated with belief in simple solutions as well as reduced feelings of control, which again boost belief in conspiracy theories. Political orientation, however, had a robust association with conspiracy mentality, even after controlling for education, further ruling out that their association is due to a confound with education and resulting control deprivation.

Despite these consistent findings across a large array of diverse national contexts, we should highlight two qualifications to our findings. First, the effect sizes are overall modest. In both studies, supporting a non-governmental party and having a low education level had substantially larger associations with conspiracy mentality than either the linear or quadratic term of political orientation. Although it was not reducible to either of the two, its contribution to the prediction of conspiracy mentality was overall modest. That said, there was remarkable heterogeneity across national contexts. In particular, the linear relation ranged from strongly negative (more conspiracy mentality among self-reported leftists, as in Spain) to strongly positive (more conspiracy mentality among the political right, as in France, Poland, or Sweden). Future research will have to provide an even greater diversity of national samples to explore these differences in more detail. In contrast to this diversity, the positive quadratic relation (more conspiracy mentality at the extremes) was more consistent, particularly in samples similar to the population in terms of key demographics in Study 2.

As the attentive reader will notice, heterogeneity was present not only between countries but also within countries when comparing the two studies. We can only speculate about the exact reasons for this. One obvious candidate might be different compositions of the samples or slightly different recruiting strategies. Another equally speculative possibility is that these associations are more volatile than is commonly assumed. Although, in general, conspiracy mentality is a relatively stable disposition, political events and rhetoric of political elites might fuel the endorsement of such worldviews and affect the course/direction of conspiratorial beliefs of citizens.

We illustrate this point with two examples. In Romania, during the collection of data for Study 2, the governing (leftist) government party (PSD) changed criminal procedure. The alleged aim was to fight a deep state orchestrated by George Soros, while in reality, arguably to save their party leader from conviction due to corruption. At that time, leftists in Romania endorsed conspiracy mentality to a greater degree than right-wingers. However, a year later in Study 1, after the leader‚Äôs conviction, the more common positive linear relationship was observed in Romania. Conversely, in Hungary, the positive linear relationship in Study 1 turned to a negative correlation in Study 2, potentially due to shifts in conspiracy rhetoric by political elites. 

Overall, our study provides the largest investigation to date of conspiracy mentality in terms of both number of participants and included countries, showing consistent support for stronger conspiracy mentality at both ends of the political spectrum. Furthermore, it adds nuance by demonstrating that conspiracy mentality is particularly pronounced on the political right, especially among voters of traditional, nationalistic, and authoritarian parties. This pattern remained intact even after controlling for political control, suggesting that anti-elite conspiracy mentality persists even when these parties assume power.","People differ in their general tendency to endorse conspiracy theories (that is, conspiracy mentality). Previous research yielded inconsistent findings on the relationship between conspiracy mentality and political orientation, showing a greater conspiracy mentality either among the political right (a linear relation) or among both the left and right extremes (a curvilinear relation). We revisited this relationship across two studies spanning 26 countries (combined N = 104,253) and found overall evidence for both linear and quadratic relations, albeit small and heterogeneous across countries. We also observed stronger support for conspiracy mentality among voters of opposition parties (that is, those deprived of political control). Nonetheless, the quadratic effect of political orientation remained significant when adjusting for political control deprivation. We conclude that conspiracy mentality is associated with extreme left- and especially extreme right-wing beliefs, and that this non-linear relation may be strengthened by, but is not reducible to, deprivation of political control.","4",0,"4","Political",3,1

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 121(28), e2320750121.","Our findings underline the power of gratitude to attenuate a key appetitive risk behavior and suggest potential improvements for public messaging campaigns. Employing nationally representative US samples and an international sample from 87 countries, we found that gratitude predicted less smoking, even after controlling for numerous covariates, whereas other positive emotions, such as compassion and hope, did not show such strong associations (Studies 1 and 2). In an experimental design (Study 3), results revealed that gratitude, unlike compassion or sadness, significantly reduced the craving to smoke, with self-reported gratitude (and happiness) mediating changes in craving. Further, induced gratitude causally increased smokers‚Äô actual quitting behavior, as evidenced by enrollment in a cessation program, with self-reported gratitude (but not happiness) again serving as the mediator (Study 4). In contrast with this pattern of results, the state-of-the-art CDC antismoking campaign primarily evoked sadness and compassion among members of the target audience and seldom gratitude (Study 5).  

The coherence observed across multiple outcomes underscores the robustness of the findings with triangulating evidence. Rather than relying solely on a singular measure of smoking behavior as an indicator of ARB, Studies 1 to 4 investigated multiple facets of engagement with and disengagement from smoking. These facets encompassed indices of current smoking behavior (Studies 1 and 2), behavioral intentions to smoke (Studies 2 and 3), and actions toward smoking cessation (Study 4). While using different operationalizations across studies may sacrifice depth on any particular index, the breadth of our approach offers significant advantages: it acknowledges the multifaceted nature of smoking behavior, allows for a comprehensive examination of its various dimensions, and avoids the risk of detecting a phenomenon that is method-dependent. Moreover, although the psychological mechanisms underlying each outcome may vary, the consistent mediation by self-reported gratitude strengthens our overarching conclusions.  

The present research contributes to theories of health decision-making from the intersecting fields of affective science, behavioral decision research, addiction science, public health, and communication. By demonstrating the powerful influence of gratitude on an ARB, our findings challenge the conclusion from meta-analyses that positive emotions do not causally reduce such behaviors. The findings also extend theories of emotion and decision-making by examining positive emotions and addictive behavior, building on previous research that focused predominantly on negative emotions, and answer a call to identify the influence of positive emotions on behavior change. Moreover, the findings refine and extend several converging theories on the function of positive affect by highlighting the importance of differentiating emotions and extending application into addictive substance use.  

The present findings also provide practical implications, offering an empirical basis for developing more effective intervention strategies. Our research provides a solid empirical base and theoretical framework from which to enhance the effectiveness of intentionally emotional antismoking campaigns, a recognized pillar of tobacco control policy intervention. Such publicly funded campaigns must compete with an estimated $8 billion spent annually on advertising and promotion by cigarette manufacturers. Given the vast imbalance between corporate tobacco spending and public health spending, it is essential for public campaigns to make efficient use of their resources. Moreover, that such campaigns can now induce gratitude, a positive emotion that triggers cascading positive effects, instead of inducing primarily negative emotions and cascading negative effects, should result in net policy improvement.  

**Limitations.** While our study represents significant progress across multiple interdisciplinary lines, several aspects require further exploration. First, our theory extends to other ARBs; however, this study exclusively focused on smoking. Evidence that writing gratitude letters causally increases healthy eating provides additional support for our theory. With that said, that study found that reduced negative affect, as opposed to gratitude or positive affect, was the significant mediator. Future research should investigate how and why gratitude might influence other forms of ARBs. Second, the present findings concerning gratitude are limited to gratitude that arises outside the context of smoking. Inducing gratitude within the context of antismoking campaigns could present challenges and may function differently when directly linked to smoking in antismoking campaigns. Different gratitude inductions may be needed at different time points for interventions to be successful, given affective adaptation. Third, the findings from Study 4 indicate that enrollment in a cessation program is a promising step toward long-term change but does not confirm enduring cessation. Therefore, future studies could investigate the long-term effects of gratitude induction. Fourth, future research could discern the potentially necessary versus sufficient contributions of the two key appraisal dimensions conceptualized in the foregoing studies (i.e., sense of gain and focus on others). Finally, we do not suggest that gratitude is the sole positive emotion capable of curbing ARBs. Other positive emotions, such as awe‚Äîwhich decreases impatience and benefits physical health‚Äîmay also be viable candidates for further research.","Meta-analyses have concluded that positive emotions do not reduce appetitive risk behaviors (risky behaviors that fulfill appetitive or craving states, such as smoking and excessive alcohol use). We propose that this conclusion is premature. Drawing on the Appraisal Tendency Framework and related theories of emotion and decision-making, we hypothesized that gratitude (a positive emotion) can decrease cigarette smoking, a leading cause of premature death globally. A series of multimethod studies provided evidence supporting our hypothesis (collective N = 34,222). Using nationally representative US samples and an international sample drawn from 87 countries, Studies 1 and 2 revealed that gratitude was inversely associated with the likelihood of smoking, even after accounting for numerous covariates. Other positive emotions (e.g., compassion) lacked such consistent associations, as expected. Study 3, and its replication, provided further support for emotion specificity: Experimental induction of gratitude, unlike compassion or sadness, reduced cigarette craving compared to a neutral state. Study 4, and its replication, showed that inducing gratitude causally increased smoking cessation behavior, as evidenced by enrollment in a web-based cessation intervention. Self-reported gratitude mediated the effects in both experimental studies. Finally, Study 5 found that current antismoking messaging campaigns by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention primarily evoked sadness and compassion, but seldom gratitude. Together, our studies advance the understanding of positive emotion effects on appetitive risk behaviors; they also offer practical implications for the design of public health campaigns.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Political",4,1

American sociological review, 71(4), 589-617.","The antidiscrimination measures we study have become popular among employers, HR managers, lawyers, and advocacy groups, despite the absence of hard evidence that they work. Employers use these practices to defend themselves in court, and the courts, in many cases, accept them as good-faith efforts to stamp out discrimination. There are reasons to believe that employers adopt antidiscrimination measures as window dressing‚Äîto inoculate themselves against liability or to improve morale‚Äîrather than to increase managerial diversity. In the final analysis, however, the measure of these programs‚Äîfor scholars, practitioners, and the courts‚Äîshould be whether they do anything to increase diversity. Using EEO-1 reports, we cannot examine whether these programs help women and African Americans move up from the bottom rungs of management, but we can show that some popular diversity programs at least help women and African Americans climb into the ranks of management, while others do not.

There is a rich tradition of theory and research on the causes of workplace inequality, but this work may not always hold clear implications for remedies. The question of how to reduce inequality is just as deserving of attention. Our conceptualization of different types of diversity programs and our analyses of their effects lay the groundwork for research and theory on the remediation of inequality in workplaces. Broadly speaking, our findings suggest that although inequality in attainment at work may be rooted in managerial bias and the social isolation of women and minorities, the best hope for remedying it lies in practices that assign organizational responsibility for change. Our own theory of the remediation of inequality builds on classical organizational sociology rather than on theories of cognitive bias or social networks.

Structures that embed accountability, authority, and expertise‚Äîsuch as affirmative action plans, diversity committees and task forces, and diversity managers and departments‚Äîare the most effective means of increasing the proportions of white women, black women, and black men in private-sector management. Moreover, they show effects even in the presence of controls for the specific initiatives that specialists often implement, from formal hiring and promotion rules to work‚Äìfamily programs. Responsibility structures also catalyze the other diversity programs, rendering each a bit more effective for one group. Some programs also prove more effective among federal contractors, likely because legal requirements encourage employers to assign responsibility for compliance.

Practices that target managerial bias through feedback (diversity evaluations) and education (diversity training) show virtually no effect in the aggregate. They show modest positive effects when responsibility structures are also in place and among federal contractors, but they sometimes show negative effects otherwise. Research to date from HR experts and psychologists suggests that interactive training workshops, of the kind we examine, often generate backlash. Finally, programs designed to counter the social isolation of women and minorities through mentoring and networking are disappointing, although mentoring does appear to help black women.

The poor performance of practices that address social‚Äìpsychological and social‚Äìrelational sources of inequality should not be taken as evidence that these forces do not produce social inequality. A preponderance of empirical research shows that bias and poor network connections contribute to inequality. Further research is needed to determine why these programs do not live up to their promise.

Much management theorizing from law and economics scholars and psychologists suggests that corporate behavior is best controlled by doling out incentives to individual managers and shaping their attitudes. This approach is rooted in a form of methodological individualism that is prominent in management research and practice. However, when it comes to addressing corporate inequality, we find that the strategies designed to change individuals are less effective than the conventional management solution of setting goals and assigning responsibility for moving toward these goals. That said, the three programs we found to be most effective likely operate in somewhat different ways. Whereas affirmative action plans and diversity staff both centralize authority over and accountability for workforce composition, diversity committees locate authority and accountability in an interdepartmental task force and may work by causing people from different parts of the organization to take responsibility for pursuing the goal of integration.

In this study, we examine managers alone. It is important for both theory and practice to extend this research to other occupational groups. Yet for employers seeking solutions to the problem of gender and racial segregation, our analyses offer hope. Most employers do something to promote diversity‚Äî76 percent had adopted one of these seven programs by 2002‚Äîbut do they do what is most effective? Diversity committees have been quite effective, requiring neither additional staff nor expensive consultants. However, less than 20 percent of the establishments we studied had them by 2002. Diversity staff are also quite effective, but only 11 percent of establishments had them. On the other hand, diversity training, which 39 percent of establishments had adopted and which can be quite costly, was not very effective and showed adverse effects among noncontractors.

Even the programs that work best have modest effects, particularly for African Americans, who are poorly represented to begin with. Diversity committees raise the proportion of black women in management by a remarkable 30 percent on average but from a baseline of only 1.4 percent. Appointing a full-time diversity staffer raises the proportion of black men by a healthy 14 percent but from a baseline of only 2.1 percent. These programs alone will not soon change the look of management. Note, however, that our sample of large, private firms has changed less quickly than the economy as a whole. In young start-up firms and in the public sector, these practices may be even more effective than they are in our sample.

The effects of these programs should not be conflated with the effects of antidiscrimination legislation. First, as we demonstrate, federal affirmative action regulations clearly mediate the efficacy of diversity evaluations and training. Our findings thus go against the popular claim that antidiscrimination regulation is no longer needed because diversity programs have gained a life of their own. Moreover, it was federal regulations that led employers to first establish affirmative action plans, the most common intervention and one of the most effective.

Second, enforcement has been effective regardless of corporate policies. As research has shown, and as our findings support, Title VII lawsuits and affirmative action compliance reviews led to increases in women‚Äôs and minorities‚Äô share of management jobs, especially in periods and judicial circuits where civil rights enforcement was strong.

Finally, to assess the impact of antidiscrimination legislation on employment inequality, one needs to consider broader political, social, and cultural changes associated with the Civil Rights Act, affirmative action, and related laws. Yet if the effects of government antidiscrimination measures have slowed, as some observers suggest, then we should waste no time sorting out which corporate programs are effective.","Employers have experimented with three broad approaches to promoting diversity. Some programs are designed to establish organizational responsibility for diversity, others to moderate managerial bias through training and feedback, and still others to reduce the social isolation of women and minority workers. These approaches find support in academic theories of how organizations achieve goals, how stereotyping shapes hiring and promotion, and how networks influence careers. This is the first systematic analysis of their efficacy. The analyses rely on federal data describing the workforces of 708 private sector establishments from 1971 to 2002, coupled with survey data on their employment practices.  

Efforts to moderate managerial bias through diversity training and diversity evaluations are least effective at increasing the share of white women, black women, and black men in management. Efforts to attack social isolation through mentoring and networking show modest effects. Efforts to establish responsibility for diversity lead to the broadest increases in managerial diversity. Moreover, organizations that establish responsibility see better effects from diversity training and evaluations, networking, and mentoring. Employers subject to federal affirmative action edicts, who typically assign responsibility for compliance to a manager, also see stronger effects from some programs.  

This work lays the foundation for an institutional theory of the remediation of workplace inequality.","2",0,"2","Political",2,0
151,46,"Van Hiel, A., & Brebels, L. (2011). Conservatism is good for you: Cultural conservatism protects self-esteem in older adults. Personality and Individual Differences, 50(1), 120-123.","The present study focused on the benefits of right-wing beliefs in the context of aging. Our finding that conservative beliefs are associated with the protection of self-esteem, especially among older individuals, contributes to the emerging literature suggesting that these beliefs may offer distinct advantages to older adults. Van Hiel and De Clercq (2009) demonstrated that authoritarianism acts as a buffer against stressful life events in a sample of retired persons. The main conclusion, therefore, is that right-wing beliefs benefit older individuals by buffering the negative effects of age on self-esteem (as shown in the present study) and alleviating the impact of negative life events on health (as demonstrated by Van Hiel & De Clercq, 2009).  

While conservatism shows a positive relationship with healthy self-esteem particularly in the oldest age group, it also exhibits a positive relationship with narcissism, or unhealthy self-esteem, regardless of age. Our findings clarify that conservatism is associated with unhealthy self-esteem among the ""younger"" elderly but with both healthy and unhealthy self-esteem among the oldest. Importantly, our results also reveal that conservatism predicts healthy self-esteem above and beyond narcissism among the oldest individuals.  

### **Personal Past and Cultural Legacy**  
Older individuals tend to focus on integrating personal experiences and memories while coming to terms with their life (Erikson, 1982; Erikson, Erikson, & Kivnick, 1986). In reconciling past experiences with the process of aging, they place themselves within the continuum of generations. Because of this focus on what can be passed down to younger generations, older people are more likely to reflect on their personal history rather than extensively engaging with new events or knowledge.  

However, this increased attention to personal history does not preclude reflection on society at large. On the contrary, personal experiences are rooted in cultural traditions that shaped identity development. According to Erikson (1982), the ego-integrated individual understands that ""an individual life is the accidental coincidence of but one life-cycle with but one segment of history"" (p. 104). Although such individuals acknowledge the relativity of various lifestyles, they also tend to defend the dignity of their own. This suggests that a strong sense of belonging to a culture and tradition, rooted in the past and preserved for the future, provides a means of granting personal significance.  

Taking this idea further, it is evident that an individual cannot find ultimate meaning in life solely within oneself. If self-evaluation is purely self-referential, death becomes nullification, as no standard remains for comparison. A meaningful life requires the presence of others, and culture represents an even broader reference point‚Äîa ""generalized other."" The evaluation of one‚Äôs personal past only makes sense in the socio-cultural context in which life has been lived, and a positive inclination toward this context makes it easier to attribute significance to one‚Äôs life and maintain a positive self-evaluation.  

### **The Downside of Cultural Adherence**  
While adherence to one's cultural traditions may serve as a mechanism for maintaining self-esteem, it also has drawbacks. Erikson‚Äôs (1982) observations suggest that individuals who strongly favor their own cultural group may also be more likely to derogate out-groups and reject those who threaten their worldview. Indeed, research suggests that older individuals exhibit higher levels of prejudice. Van Hiel and De Clercq (2009) raised the possibility that right-wing beliefs may act as a stress-release mechanism by channeling negative emotions toward others, suggesting that scapegoating may increase personal well-being at the expense of others.  

### **Study Limitations**  
One limitation of this study is the potential for an unwarranted leap from reporting associations to inferring longitudinal explanations in terms of life-cycle or aging effects. It could be argued that our findings reflect cohort effects rather than aging effects, meaning that each generation‚Äôs attitudes are shaped by the ideological climate in which they grew up. Strictly speaking, longitudinal data would be required to rule out this alternative explanation. However, we believe that an aging-based interpretation is defensible. Research in developmental psychology suggests that political attitudes exhibit flexibility throughout the lifespan (Levenson, 2000), challenging the notion of stable attitudes formed in adolescence. Additionally, the finding that similar relationships between age and conservatism emerge in countries with different political-economic histories, including former communist states, supports the notion of generational rather than purely cohort-based effects (Cornelis et al., 2009).  

Another limitation is that while our main hypothesis is grounded in Terror Management Theory (TMT), other unstudied variables may also explain the beneficial effects of right-wing attitudes among older individuals. Future studies should explore additional mechanisms, such as stress relief and scapegoating, as suggested by Van Hiel and De Clercq (2009).","The present research explores whether adhering to cultural conservative beliefs elevates self-esteem in older people. In a sample of 311 retired persons, it was found that conservatism was positively related to self-esteem, and that this relationship was especially strong in the oldest age group. Statistical control for narcissism did not undermine this moderation effect between age and conservatism on self-esteem. In the discussion, we argue that conservatism among older people seems to be associated with a focus on putting personal history in a social-cultural context.","6",0,"6","Political",5,1
152,46,"Mosleh, M., Yang, Q., Zaman, T., Pennycook, G., & Rand, D. G. (2024). Differences in misinformation sharing can lead to politically asymmetric sanctions. Nature, 1-8.","Our results suggest that using politically balanced groups of laypeople to evaluate content may be an effective approach to identifying misinformation while mitigating accusations of political bias. Additionally, increasing transparency on the part of platforms‚Äîspecifically regarding the characteristics (e.g., demographics) of users being sanctioned and the reasons for these sanctions‚Äîmay help the public better understand how neutral policies can create the appearance of bias.  

In sum, when political asymmetries exist in misinformation sharing (in either direction), platforms face a fundamental trade-off between reducing the spread of misinformation and maintaining politically balanced enforcement. Asymmetric enforcement may also arise outside the realm of political orientation; for instance, if a particular demographic group is disproportionately targeted with misinformation, they may share more of it and thus be sanctioned at higher rates. Our argument is not specific to one direction of association between political orientation and misinformation sharing‚Äîthese dynamics may shift over time or vary depending on the topic.  

If one political, social, or demographic group shares more misinformation‚Äîwhether liberals, conservatives, or another group‚Äîmaximally effective enforcement against misinformation will inevitably lead to more actions against members of that group. However, our findings do not rule out the possibility of bias on the part of platforms. Rather, we demonstrate that asymmetries in enforcement are, in themselves, not necessarily indicative of intentional targeting or bias. Given the widespread bipartisan demand for reducing misinformation online, policymakers must recognize that some level of differential treatment across groups is likely to occur, even if technology companies are enforcing policies in an unbiased manner to curb misinformation.","In response to intense pressure, technology companies have enacted policies to combat misinformation. However, the enforcement of these policies has led to frequent accusations of political bias. We argue that differential sharing of misinformation by individuals identifying with different political groups could lead to political asymmetries in enforcement, even under unbiased policies.  

To explore this, we first analyzed 9,000 politically active Twitter users during the 2020 U.S. presidential election. While users estimated to be pro-Trump/conservative were significantly more likely to be suspended than those estimated to be pro-Biden/liberal, we found that pro-Trump/conservative users also shared a greater number of links to various sets of low-quality news sites‚Äîeven when news quality was assessed by politically balanced groups of laypeople or groups consisting solely of Republican laypeople. Additionally, pro-Trump/conservative users exhibited higher estimated likelihoods of being bots.  

We observed similar associations between conservatism and low-quality news sharing across seven other datasets, covering Twitter, Facebook, and survey experiments spanning from 2016 to 2023. These datasets included data from 16 different countries, with news quality evaluated by both expert panels and politically balanced layperson groups. Our findings suggest that, even under politically neutral anti-misinformation policies, political asymmetries in enforcement should be expected. Therefore, political imbalance in enforcement does not necessarily imply bias on the part of social media companies implementing anti-misinformation policies.","4",0,"4","Political",4,1
153,46,"Wang, K., Goldenberg, A., Dorison, C. A., Miller, J. K., Uusberg, A., Lerner, J. S., ... & ≈†trukelj, E. (2021). A multi-country test of brief reappraisal interventions on emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nature human behaviour, 5(8), 1089-1110.","The current study had two primary objectives. The first was to assess the shared effects of two brief reappraisal interventions‚Äîreconstrual and repurposing‚Äîon negative and positive emotions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to both passive and active control conditions. We also aimed to determine whether these effects varied across different countries/regions and COVID-19 circumstances. The second goal was to investigate potential differences in the effectiveness of the two reappraisal interventions in regulating emotions.  

Regarding the first objective, we found strong support for our hypotheses: both reappraisal interventions significantly reduced negative emotional responses (hypothesis 1) and increased positive emotional responses (hypothesis 2) across all primary measures. These effects were evident in participants' immediate emotional reactions to COVID-19-related images, their overall state emotions after viewing all images, and their broader emotional assessments of the COVID-19 situation. Exploratory analyses further suggested that reappraisal interventions improved reported emotions compared to participants' emotional states at the start of the study and their anticipated future emotions.  

Despite substantial local variations in pandemic severity and cultural differences in emotional responses, the interventions were effective in nearly all countries/regions. Among the 37 locations with sufficient statistical power (over 200 participants), 89% showed significant effects of reappraisal interventions in reducing negative emotions. While these effects tended to be stronger among females and unemployed individuals without income, they remained largely unaffected by participants' education level, subjective socioeconomic status, or whether their country/region was under lockdown.  

Regarding the second objective, we initially hypothesized that reconstrual would be more effective at reducing negative emotions (hypothesis 3), while repurposing would be more effective at increasing positive emotions (hypothesis 4). However, our findings did not provide reliable support for either hypothesis‚Äîboth interventions performed similarly across all emotional outcomes. This suggests that in the context of COVID-19, both forms of reappraisal were equally viable, possibly because the pandemic provided opportunities for both construing emotional situations differently (enabling reconstrual) and evaluating them in light of alternative goals (enabling repurposing). Future research could explore whether combining these strategies yields additional benefits and whether they perform similarly in other emotional contexts.  

Interestingly, although participants were trained in only one form of reappraisal, they reported using both strategies more often than those in the control conditions. This overlap could be due to insufficient differentiation in the instructional materials, limited accessibility of the theoretical distinction between the two strategies for laypeople, or a natural association between the two approaches, where learning one primes the other. Future research should investigate these possibilities more directly.  

Beyond assessing the primary goals, we examined whether improving emotional well-being through reappraisal might unintentionally reduce intentions to engage in preventive health behaviors‚Äîa potential concern in public health messaging. Encouragingly, we found no evidence that reappraisal interventions reduced participants' motivation to practice health-protective behaviors. This aligns with recent research suggesting that motivating preventive behaviors does not require inducing negative emotions.  

Our findings highlight the potential benefits of scalable reappraisal interventions in fostering psychological resilience and mitigating the emotional impact of the pandemic. The effects of these interventions were substantial‚Äîcomparable in magnitude to the emotional differences between individuals facing extreme hardships (lockdowns or symptom-induced isolations) and those experiencing neither hardship. This suggests that reappraisal interventions can have meaningful real-world impacts. Given that emotional well-being often remains compromised months into a crisis, and that stress and negative emotions can impair vaccine efficacy and contribute to harmful behaviors, such interventions could be particularly valuable for essential workers, healthcare professionals, students, patients, and other highly affected populations. Because reappraisal interventions are inexpensive, brief, and easily scalable, they could be implemented through advertising campaigns, public speeches, educational courses, mobile apps, and other digital platforms.  

From a scientific perspective, this study represents the largest cross-cultural investigation of reappraisal to date, extending beyond the WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) populations that dominate social science research. Our findings reinforce the generalizability of reappraisal effects across diverse global contexts and provide insights into how contextual factors‚Äîsuch as individualism, lockdown status, and demographic characteristics‚Äîshape emotional regulation processes. Additionally, our dataset presents opportunities for further research on emotion regulation, cultural differences, and psychological resilience.  

### **Limitations**  
Despite the encouraging results, several limitations should be noted. First, our use of convenience sampling and a limited set of images may have influenced the findings. Our sample was not nationally representative within each country/region and may have overrepresented females, younger individuals, and those with internet access. The selected images, while carefully chosen, may not fully capture local pandemic experiences. Future research should test generalizability using nationally representative samples and more personalized emotional stimuli.  

Second, we cannot fully rule out the influence of demand characteristics and expectancies. Although we attempted to match these factors across conditions using an active control, we did not directly quantify their comparability. Future studies should assess expectancies before participants engage with the interventions.  

Third, this study only examined the immediate and short-term effects of reappraisal interventions. Future longitudinal research is needed to determine whether these effects persist over time and how frequently individuals should engage in reappraisal for sustained benefits.  

Fourth, our study relied primarily on self-reported emotional outcomes. To fully assess the impact of reappraisal, future research should incorporate objective behavioral and physiological measures, such as actual adherence to health guidelines and health outcomes.  

Finally, before implementing reappraisal interventions at scale, further evaluation is needed using formal cost-benefit analyses and frameworks such as RE-AIM (Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) to optimize their effectiveness in real-world applications.  

### **Conclusion**  
In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that two brief reappraisal interventions had robust, cross-culturally generalizable effects in reducing negative emotions and increasing positive emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic‚Äîwithout diminishing intentions to engage in preventive health behaviors. We hope that this study informs efforts to develop scalable interventions that enhance psychological resilience during global crises and beyond.","The COVID-19 pandemic has globally increased negative emotions and decreased positive emotions, potentially leading to a range of adverse impacts if left unaddressed. To mitigate these emotional changes, we tested the effectiveness of reappraisal‚Äîan emotion-regulation strategy that alters how one thinks about a situation.  

Participants from 87 countries and regions (n = 21,644) were randomly assigned to one of two brief reappraisal interventions (reconstrual or repurposing) or one of two control conditions (active or passive). Results consistently showed that both reappraisal interventions, compared to both control conditions, significantly reduced negative emotions and increased positive emotions across multiple measures. The effects of reconstrual and repurposing interventions were comparable.  

Importantly, planned exploratory analyses indicated that reappraisal interventions did not reduce participants' intentions to engage in preventive health behaviors. These findings highlight the potential for developing scalable, low-cost interventions that can be implemented worldwide to enhance emotional well-being.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Political",4,1

Second, in terms of basic values, tradition was the strongest correlate, showing a negative relationship with cognitive ability. Security and conformity also had notable negative correlations with intelligence, whereas self-direction, universalism, and benevolence were positively correlated with intelligence. Third, narrow values mostly predicted cognitive ability similarly to their corresponding basic values, except for the narrow values associated with self-direction and universalism. Fourth, across all levels of the personal values hierarchy, values predicted crystallized intelligence much better than they predicted fluid intelligence. Fifth, the 10 basic values provided substantially better prediction of cognitive ability compared with the two higher-order values, while the 19 narrow values offered only marginally improved prediction of cognitive ability beyond the basic values. Sixth, personality facets, but not personality domains, provided meaningful incremental prediction of intelligence over and above personal values. Seventh, item-level predictive models offered further meaningful incremental prediction over and above scale scores. Collectively, these findings have significant implications for understanding the connections between personal values and cognitive abilities.  

**Personal Values and Cognitive Ability**  
In general, correlations between personal values and intelligence were quite strong, given the attenuating factors when correlating self-report psychological characteristics with objectively scored ability measures. In addition to the normal measurement error indexed by measures of internal consistency, typical intelligence measures fall short of the gold standard of comprehensive one-on-one administered batteries, such as the WAIS. Self-report measures also have numerous issues related to rating biases, anchoring effects, idiosyncratic item interpretation, and inaccurate self-insight (Connelly & Ones, 2010; McCrae, 2018). When the constructs are aligned, raw meta-analytic correlations between self-rated intelligence and objectively assessed intelligence are only r = .33 (Freund & Kasten, 2012). In the personality context, the strongest personality domain correlates with intelligence is openness (r = .18), and the strongest personality facets include openness to ideas (r = .30; NEO) and intellect (r = .31; BFAS) (Anglim, Dunlop, et al., 2022). Conceptually, intellect is a similar theoretical construct to intelligence, and openness to ideas represents enjoyment in engaging with intellectual ideas, which shares many close conceptual links with intelligence. Yet, correlations with intelligence are only in the .30 to .35 range. This makes the r = ‚àí.29 correlation with the basic value of tradition and the r =‚àí.24 correlation with the higher-order value of conservation noteworthy.  

Overall, conservation had a fairly strong negative correlation with general intelligence, with the strongest correlations observed for tradition and security, followed by conformity and the negative correlation for the reversed indicator, self-direction. This is broadly consistent with meta-analytic research on correlations with political conservatism (Onraet et al., 2015) and the meta-analytic correlation for the openness to values facet of the NEO (Anglim, Dunlop, et al., 2022). One interpretation is that intelligent people may have a stronger desire to decide on their own belief structure, whereas less intelligent people may be more open to accepting the belief structure of their culture or religion. Intelligence also tends to lead to more education, which in turn may contribute to intelligence (Ritchie & Tucker-Drob, 2018), and education may foster a critical perspective on past practices and beliefs, further consolidating values based on personal reflection (Hastie, 2007; Hattie & Donoghue, 2016). Third variables that influence both conservatism and intelligence might also explain the relationship, but if so, it is more than just age and gender.  

Correlations between self-enhancement and general intelligence were close to zero, but at the basic level, intelligence was characterized by higher levels of universalism and benevolence, with much smaller positive correlations for valuing achievement and power. In general, almost everyone valued benevolence, which suggests that given the ipsative way that personal values are scored, it may particularly be valuing benevolence more relative to other values that led to the positive correlations. Universalism is the value that aligns most strongly with openness including inquisitiveness, which is notably related to intelligence, and compassion has shown notable meta-analytic correlations with intelligence (Stanek & Ones, 2023). Thus, intelligence and openness may contribute to the formation of a more expansive moral circle that incorporates the global community, other species, and the environment.  

Another key result was that personal values tended to correlate two to three times more strongly with crystallized intelligence than with fluid intelligence, and a similar result was seen for personality correlates of intelligence. This is consistent with the meta-analytic literature on the relationships between cognitive ability and personality (Anglim, Dunlop, et al., 2022) and cognitive ability and conservatism (Onraet et al., 2015). Many researchers have interpreted this finding‚Äîparticularly regarding the value of openness‚Äîas supporting the theory that openness leads to greater investment in learning, which in turn translates into more acquired knowledge (P. L. Ackerman, 1996; Cattell, 1987; Von Stumm & Furnham, 2012). However, cognitive ability is also likely to have a causal influence on personality traits and values. In particular, if the component measures are interpreted more as measures of verbal and nonverbal ability (for critical discussion, see DeYoung, 2020; Johnson & Bouchard Jr, 2005), it may be that there is something particular about verbal ability‚Äîand the cultural and educational factors that cultivate its development‚Äîthat plays an important role in promoting the observed value profile.  

**Predicting Cognitive Ability From Personal Values and Personality**  
The research also speaks to the general predictive validity of different levels of the values hierarchy, both in general and in relation to cognitive ability. The 10 basic values provided substantially improved prediction of cognitive ability compared with the higher-order values. The pattern of correlations between basic values and intelligence varied within the higher-order values structure, showing more consistency within a given pole. For instance, three basic values associated with high conservation were all negatively correlated with intelligence, whereas only one of the three values negatively related to conservation was correlated with intelligence.  

In contrast, narrow values provided minimal incremental prediction over and above basic values, although there were a few small differential correlations. This contrasted with models predicting age and sex from values, which showed at least some notable incremental prediction from narrow values. For personality, it is the personality facets that provide notable incremental prediction of intelligence. Regarding basic values, they seem to carve up a conceptual space of individual differences, notably related to agreeableness/honesty-humility and openness. In that sense, there is some similarity between basic values and personality facets.  

Interestingly, personal values were somewhat better at predicting intelligence than was personality. Specifically, the two higher-order values were about as good as the six broad traits, and the 10 basic values achieved slightly better prediction of intelligence than the much less parsimonious 25 facets. Furthermore, broad traits provided no meaningful incremental prediction over and above basic values, although facets did provide some incremental prediction. While the higher-order value of conservation may have captured some of the predictive validity of openness, it also seems to combine elements uniquely related to intelligence, including religion, cultural affiliations, and political orientations that may be less attractive to more intelligent people.  

**Limitations and Future Directions**  
While the large sample size, broad demographic coverage, and comprehensive assessments represent major strengths of the current research, limitations should be noted. First, assessments took place in a job applicant context, which may lead to a modest amount of socially desirable responding on values (Anglim, Molloy, et al., 2022) and personality (Hu & Connelly, 2021). For HEXACO-specific estimates, see Anglim, Morse, et al. (2017). Nonetheless, the testing context likely motivated participants to complete the assessments conscientiously. Second, the research took place in Australia. While the structure of values is fairly stable across cultures, the profile of dominant values varies (Schwartz, 2012). Future research could examine the extent to which the relationship between intelligence and values varies across cultures.","This study offers the most comprehensive assessment to date of the relationship between personal values and cognitive ability. A large sample of Australian adults (n = 15,552; 60% female; age M = 38.7, SD = 10.7) completed Schwartz‚Äôs Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ-RR), 200-item HEXACO Personality Inventory‚ÄìRevised, and measures of general intelligence, crystallized intelligence (verbal ability), and fluid intelligence (abstract reasoning) as part of a job application. General intelligence correlated positively with self-direction, benevolence, and universalism, and negatively with security, tradition, and conformity. Crystallized intelligence correlated more strongly with values than did fluid intelligence. Basic values explained more variance in cognitive ability compared with higher-order values, while narrow values provided minimal incremental prediction. Personal values correlated more strongly with intelligence than did personality traits. Item-level models for personal values and personality offered meaningful incremental prediction of intelligence. Findings support refinement of theories on the development of values, personality, and cognitive ability.","4",0,"4","Apolitical",4,0

Psychological Bulletin, 129(3), 339-375. https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.339","We have argued that several specific motives relating to the management of fear and uncertainty are associated with the ideology of political conservatism. Our analysis in terms of motivated social cognition helps both to integrate seemingly unrelated hypotheses derived from the literature on personality and individual differences and social psychology and to expand on these hypotheses to further understand the role of situational factors in the vicissitudes of conservatism. By reviewing the results from many different studies aggregated across various behavioral domains and contexts, we found that a moderate to strong relationship does exist between an interrelated set of epistemic, existential, and ideological motives and the expression of political conservatism. In concluding, we consider issues that are deserving of future empirical attention and summarize what we have learned by viewing political conservatism through a motivated social‚Äìcognitive lens.

A Plea for Future Research
One of the most promising implications of treating political conservatism as a specific manifestation of motivated social cognition is a theoretical and practical focus on situational determinants. This is because explanations in social cognition tend to emphasize the temporary accessibility of certain attitudes, beliefs, goals, and motives and their perceived applicability to the immediate situation (e.g., Bargh & Gollwitzer, 1994; Higgins, 1996; Kruglanski, 1989). We have reviewed existing evidence concerning the effects of situationally induced threats on conservative political outcomes, but much more of interest remains to be done. Our hope is that, by underscoring the cognitive‚Äìmotivational bases of political conservatism, future research will at long last address a wider range of social situations and conditions that give rise and momentum to conservative attitudes, thoughts, behaviors, and even social movements.

Although the evidence concerning the effects of threat on conservative ideology is highly instructive, other situational predictors of conservative attitudes and responses are still relatively understudied in the psychology of conservatism. Because conservatism often takes the form of a social movement that is shared by large groups of people in particular historical periods (e.g., Diamond, 1995; Habermas, 1989; Kolko, 1963; Lyons & Berlet, 1996), it may be thought of as a social norm that emerges under certain social and political circumstances. Our review indicates that too many psychological accounts of conservatism in the past have treated it solely as a dispositional orientation and not as a situational reaction, although it is true that the disposition is often hypothesized to develop in response to certain social and family situations in childhood (e.g., Adorno et al., 1950; Altemeyer, 1981, 1988; Sears, 1983; Sulloway, 1996; Tomkins, 1995). For the sake of understanding the nature of ideology, we hope future studies are as successful at documenting the temporary accessibility of right-wing attitudes as studies of individual differences have been at documenting the chronic accessibility of such orientations and their correlates.

Consistent with these goals, we note that there is a strong need to go beyond purely correlational research designs, which limited the validity of the earlier personality research on authoritarianism, dogmatism, and the origins of political ideology and contributed to its eventual obscurity (see W. F. Stone et al., 1993). Thus far, the strongest experimental evidence bearing on the possibility of manipulating conservative tendencies probably comes from the mortality salience paradigm used by terror management theorists. Priming thoughts of death has been shown to increase intolerance, out-group derogation, punitive aggression, veneration of authority figures, and system justification (Florian et al., 2001; Greenberg et al., 1990, 1995; McGregor et al., 2001; Rosenblatt et al., 1989; Schimel et al., 1999; van den Bos & Miedema, 2000). Other archival and experimental evidence suggests that social and economic threats increase authoritarian and right-wing responding (e.g., Doty et al., 1991; Jost, 1996; McCann, 1997; Reich, 1946/1970; Sales, 1972, 1973; Sales & Friend, 1973). Experimental paradigms developed in studies of the need for cognitive closure, prevention versus promotion regulatory focus, and system justification are also highly promising candidates for use in future research on situational variation in conservatism. The next generation of researchers should also strive, whenever possible, to include more direct measures of epistemic, existential, and ideological motives.

All of the motives we have reviewed are theoretically related to one or both of two core dimensions of conservative thought, namely, resistance to change and support for inequality. The quest for certainty and ideological stability, we have argued, is linked to the goal of resisting social and political change (e.g., Wilson, 1973c). Motives pertaining to fear and threat, by comparison, are more likely to be associated with ideological support for inequality, insofar as it justifies the striving for security and dominance in social hierarchies (e.g., Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). These are theoretical points that await direct empirical confrontation, especially as regards the direction of causality. Do psychological motives cause the adoption of specific ideological beliefs concerning resistance to change and support for inequality, or do these ideological commitments carry with them psychological consequences, or both? Our review has presented consistent correlational evidence linking the psychological and the political, and our integrated theoretical framework has identified plausible interpretations of these data, but direct causal investigations are needed in the future to substantiate the particulars of our theoretical perspective.

What Have We Learned?
Understanding the psychological underpinnings of conservatism has for centuries posed a challenge for historians, philosophers, and social scientists. By now, hundreds of empirical investigations have been carried out worldwide, and at least three types of theories have been offered to explicate the psychological bases of conservative and right-wing ideologies. Our contribution here has been to review and summarize this work and to integrate it within the ambitious and broad framework of motivated social cognition. In doing so, we have drawn a number of conclusions, which should be made explicit in order to better understand the various ways in which political conservatism may be thought of as a form of motivated social cognition.

An important conclusion that follows from our analysis is that political attitudes and beliefs possess a strong motivational basis (e.g., Duckitt, 2001; Dunning, 1999; Fiske & Taylor, 1991; Kruglanski, 1996; Kunda, 1990). Conservative ideologies, like virtually all other belief systems, are adopted in part because they satisfy various psychological needs. To say that ideological belief systems have a strong motivational basis is not to say that they are unprincipled, unwarranted, or unresponsive to reason or evidence. Although the (partial) causes of ideological beliefs may be motivational, the reasons (and rationalizations) whereby individuals justify those beliefs to themselves and others are assessed according to informational criteria (Kruglanski, 1989, 1999).

The socially constructed nature of human belief systems (see Jost & Kruglanski, 2002) makes it unlikely that a complete explanation of conservative ideology could ever be provided in terms of a single motivational syndrome. Ideologies, like other social representations, may be thought of as possessing a core and a periphery (Abric, 2001), and each may be fueled by separate motivational concerns. The most that can be expected of a general psychological analysis is for it to partially explain the core of political conservatism because the peripheral aspects are by definition highly protean and driven by historically changing, local contexts.

We regard political conservatism as an ideological belief system that is significantly (but not completely) related to motivational concerns having to do with the psychological management of uncertainty and fear. Specifically, the avoidance of uncertainty (and the striving for certainty) may be particularly tied to one core dimension of conservative thought, resistance to change (Wilson, 1973c). Similarly, concerns with fear and threat may be linked to the second core dimension of conservatism, endorsement of inequality (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999).

In conclusion, our comprehensive review integrates several decades of research having to do with the psychological bases of political conservatism. Most of what is known about the psychology of conservatism fits exceedingly well with theories of motivated social cognition. The integrative framework developed here has implications for resolving historically controversial issues, and we have argued that it has great generative potential for guiding future work on the subject of conservatism.","Analyzing political conservatism as motivated social cognition integrates theories of personality (authoritarianism, dogmatism‚Äìintolerance of ambiguity), epistemic and existential needs (for closure, regulatory focus, terror management), and ideological rationalization (social dominance, system justification). A meta-analysis (88 samples, 12 countries, 22,818 cases) confirms that several psychological variables predict political conservatism: death anxiety (weighted mean r = .50); system instability (.47); dogmatism‚Äìintolerance of ambiguity (.34); openness to experience (‚Äì.32); uncertainty tolerance (‚Äì.27); needs for order, structure, and closure (.26); integrative complexity (‚Äì.20); fear of threat and loss (.18); and self-esteem (‚Äì.09). The core ideology of conservatism stresses resistance to change and justification of inequality and is motivated by needs that vary situationally and dispositionally to manage uncertainty and threat.","4",0,"4","Political",2,1

Science, 339(6124), 1152‚Äì1153. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1231320","Many countries are facing a retirement savings crisis. In the United States, for example, the fraction of workers at risk of having inadequate funds to maintain their lifestyle through retirement is estimated to have increased from 31% to 53% from 1983 to 2010. Roughly half of U.S. employees (78 million) have no access to retirement plans at their workplace. Fortunately, there are solutions to these problems. We simply have to change the choice architecture of retirement plans by utilizing the findings of behavioral economics research and make such plans available to all workers. We describe a large-scale field demonstration of the potential impact of such research-based changes in how we save.

One reason for the savings crisis is the ongoing shift in the private sector from defined benefit pension plans (DB, where retirement benefits are formulaic and known in advance) to defined contribution plans (DC, where benefits depend on investment outcomes). This trend is spreading to the public sector as well and is likely to quicken given the dire underfunding of many state and local pension plans. The United States is not alone in facing these problems. The UK is launching the National Employment Savings Trust, a national payroll savings plan similar to the New Zealand KiwiSaver program.

Making a payroll-based savings plan available to everyone is essential because it is the most effective way for the middle class to save. But having a plan offered at the workplace is not sufficient. Even for those with access to an employer-sponsored plan, almost a quarter fail to join, and among those who do join, many save too little.

There are four essential ingredients to any comprehensive plan to facilitate adequate saving for retirement: availability, automatic enrollment, automatic investment, and automatic escalation.

Availability. Every U.S. worker should have easy access to a payroll deduction‚Äìbased DC plan. The Obama Administration has proposed a universal program called the auto-IRA (Individual Retirement Account), which will require employers who do not offer a retirement plan to auto-enroll their employees in an IRA account. Of course, workers can opt out. The state of California has passed a similar plan called the California Secure Choice Retirement Savings Trust.

Automatic enrollment. In traditional DC plans, participants must make an active decision to enroll, including picking a savings rate and an investment portfolio. Many employees intend to join but never get around to it. There is now conclusive evidence that automatic enrollment, where employees are automatically signed up unless they opt out, is extremely successful in overcoming the procrastination that can impede signing up. Opt out rates average about 10%.                                                                                    Automatic investment. If employees are automatically enrolled, there has to be a default investment option. Fortunately, since the Department of Labor established the criteria for qualified default investment vehicles, both employers and asset managers have worked to create a variety of investment vehicles that provide employees with sensible diversification and an asset allocation mix that is automatically rebalanced when stock prices change (thus, buying stocks in 2009 when the market bottomed), as well as adjusting the portfolio as the employee ages.

Automatic escalation. About three-quarters of automatic enrollment plans use an initial saving rate of just 3% of income. Research shows that when offered the default rate many passively accept it, but had they been forced to make a choice on their own, some would have selected a higher rate. Automatic enrollment does a good job of getting people started, but employees can be stuck for years saving at an insufficient rate.

We argue that the solution to the problem of saving too little is automatic escalation, a generic term for a plan we devised called Save More Tomorrow (SMT), based on behavioral economics research. The original SMT program has three components. First, employees are invited to commit now to increase their saving rate later, perhaps next January or a few months in the future. Self-control is easier to accept if delayed rather than immediate. Second, planned increases in the saving rate are linked to pay raises. This is meant to diminish the effect of loss aversion‚Äîthe tendency to weigh losses larger than gains. Because the increase in the savings rate is just a portion of the pay raise, employees do not see their pay fall. Third, once employees sign up for the plan, they remain in it until they reach a preset limit or choose to opt out. This uses inertia to keep people in the system.

At the first company that implemented SMT, employees who elected to join (and 78% of those offered the plan did) ended up almost quadrupling their saving rate from 3.5% to 13.6% in slightly less than 4 years. This evidence of success stimulated employers and administrators to adopt the Save More Tomorrow plan (or the generic version, automatic escalation, which does not link savings increases to pay increases). Take-up then increased considerably, helped by the passage of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which encouraged firms to adopt a combination of automatic enrollment and automatic escalation. By 2011, 56% of employers who offer 401(k) plans automatically enrolled employees, and 51% offered automatic escalation.        The ideas are spreading, but has retirement saving actually increased? To address this question, we estimated the effect of automatic escalation, because automatic enrollment can have an ambiguous effect on the average saving rate. We contacted the largest 25 companies that administer retirement plans, which service roughly 90% of participants in DC plans according to the 2012 Pensions and Investments directory of retirement plan providers. We asked each plan provider for the following data as of the end of year 2011: the number of plan participants they serve who are currently making contributions to their plan (N); the number of plan participants who are enrolled in a SMT or other automatic escalation program (S).

We received data from 13 of the 25 plan providers, covering 55% of plan participants according to the Pensions and Investment directory. Of the 20,628,702 contributing participants in our data, 2,268,726 are enrolled in an automatic escalation program, yielding a utilization rate (S/N) of 11%. If this utilization rate is applied to the entire universe of participants, we estimate that there are already about 4.1 million participants who are having their savings rates automatically increased.

We calculated the effect of automatic escalation on retirement plan saving rates, based on the conservative assumption that salary deferral rates are increased automatically by just 1 percentage point per year for only 3 years. These are the minimum requirements set by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Some plans go beyond this minimum, either in the rate at which deferrals are increased or in the number of years such increases are continued, so our estimate of the increase in savings is biased downward. Our estimate is also biased downward because we do not include the effect of additional matching contributions by employers, typically 50% up to some cap. At the current utilization level of automatic escalation, 11% of participants boost their salary deferral rates by 3% over 3 years, which results in an average increase of 0.33% for the universe of plan participants (11% penetration times 3% increase in deferral rate). To put this 0.33% effect in perspective, the average deferral rate is 6.2%, as reported by the Plan Sponsor Council of America. We interpret this as showing that the intervention is having a noticeable effect, even at the currently low take-up rate by employees. We estimate that automatic escalation boosted annual savings by $7.4 billion, if we assume an average annual compensation of $60,000 and a 3% increase in deferral rates.  The next step is to increase program utilization. There are three simple ways to achieve this goal.

First, it should be easier for workers to join the plan. Of the employees offered the original version of SMT, 78% signed up, in part due to the ease of doing so (employees met with a financial adviser who took all necessary steps to join). Take-up rates in most plans are much lower, in part because employees do not know the option exists or find the sign-up procedure cumbersome. Making the option more salient and making it easier to enroll will likely pay dividends. Alternatively, automatic escalation can be made the default, both for new and existing employees who are stuck at a low savings rate. Of course, in this case, opting out must be easy.

Second, this feature can be included in existing DC plans offered to government workers. For example, the Save More Tomorrow Act of 2012 proposes to offer this feature to federal government workers in their existing Thrift Savings Plan.

Third, automatic escalation should be included in the new plans targeting employees without a savings plan at work such as the auto-IRA and the California Secure Choice Retirement Savings program. Automatically enrolling employees at a low initial savings rate without incorporating automatic escalation is simply bad policy.

One question about these efforts has until recently been impossible to answer: Does inducing larger contributions to retirement saving actually increase total saving, or does it simply shift saving from one place (say, a bank account) into another? However, new work using Danish data that include measures of household wealth suggests that when employees are automatically enrolled into a retirement savings plan, 85% of that savings is new, rather than shifted.

Lessons from this savings example can be applied in other domains. For example, much of the rise in health care spending in the United States is not just a problem with the health care‚Äìdelivery system but also inadequacies in the ways by which we encourage people to be healthy. Dealing with obesity and its health consequences is first and foremost a behavior problem. If we can nudge people toward a healthier diet and more exercise, we will end up spending less delivering treatments. Similarly, in stressing incentives to encourage patients to economize, we can miss more important determinants of health outcomes. For some patients, the most important way to improve health outcomes is to make sure patients take their prescribed medicines, but many do not. Charging high copays in such situations is counterproductive. Choice architecture can have profound impacts on behavior, more powerful than might be achieved merely with financial incentives.","","4",0,"4","Apolitical",4,0

It is a practical theory‚Äîcomplete with a set of well-validated measurement tools‚Äîwhich has quickly yielded a great variety of new findings, in many fields. It is a non-Procrustean theory which does not force researchers to ‚Äúsurrender the adequate representation‚Äù of experience. And it is an open and revisable theory, offering an initial list of foundations along with a list of criteria for how to revise the list. MFT is a theory in motion, a theory to be expanded, constricted, refined, and built upon. Above all, we think it is the right theory for our age‚Äîa golden age of cross-disciplinary research in which most scientists studying morality have at least some familiarity with findings in neighboring fields. Conferences on moral psychology nowadays often include researchers who study chimpanzees, psychopaths, infants, hunter-gatherers, or people with brain damage. MFT gives this varied set of researchers a common language for talking about the moral domain. It calms the sometimes-divisive nature-nurture debate by distinguishing the first draft of the moral mind and the experiential editing process.
We think MFT is practical in another way too: it helps researchers as well as the general public look beyond the moral values that are dearest to them, and understand those who live in a different moral matrix. We close with a final quote from Berlin (2001), who explains one reason why pluralism is so practical:
If I am a man or a woman with sufficient imagination (and this I do need), I can enter into a value system which is not my own, but which is nevertheless something I can conceive of men pursuing while remaining human, while remaining creatures with whom I can communicate, with whom I have some common values‚Äîfor all human beings must have some common values or they cease to be human, and also some different values else they cease to differ, as in fact they do. That is why pluralism is not relativism‚Äîthe multiple values are objective, part of the essence of humanity rather than arbitrary creations of men's subjective fancies.","Where does morality come from? Why are moral judgments often so similar across cultures, yet sometimes so variable? Is morality one thing, or many? Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) was created to answer these questions. In this chapter, we describe the origins, assumptions, and current conceptualization of the theory and detail the empirical findings that MFT has made possible, both within social psychology and beyond. Looking toward the future, we embrace several critiques of the theory and specify five criteria for determining what should be considered a foundation of human morality.

As we have highlighted, there are particular barriers to accepting that climate change is an intergroup problem with justice implications. The depth of psychological knowledge and theories about social justice, perceptions of inequality, social identity, overcoming prejudice, and related topics are essential for forward motion on climate change action. These topic areas provide insights into reasons for and ways to overcome barriers to perceiving, caring about, accepting responsibility for, and taking action to address climate change. Evolving research is examining how to successfully communicate about the physical aspects of climate change and similar efforts are needed to communicate the intergroup aspects of climate change. The abundance of research on group processes and intergroup relations provides avenues for addressing social and environmental injustices caused by climate change, particularly as caused by the wealthiest and most advantaged people and countries. These lessons can be applied to reducing human contributions to climate change and helping the most vulnerable adapt to unavoidable climate changes, which, because of the global nature of climate change and our mutual interdependence, will benefit everyone.
There is a critical need to apply expertise on what we know about psychological processes that influence minimization of various types of problems to understanding and moving forward in our ability to address climate change and associated injustices. Climate change is caused by humans and solutions need to take into account human relations with people, animals, and the rest of the planet. Thus, the issue of climate change can benefit from and presents new and unprecedented challenges to research on group processes and intergroup relations.","Climate change is a global problem that is caused by humans and must be solved by humans, and while differences exist, many theories and research on prejudice and discrimination have direct connections to the psychological processes involved in climate change.

Arguably it not only violates human rights but also the rights of animals and nature.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 118(22), 1‚Äì8. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2102142118","Social media platforms provide direct access to an unprecedented amount of content. Platforms originally designed for user entertainment changed the way information spread. Indeed, feed algorithms mediate and influence the content promotion accounting for users‚Äô preferences and attitudes. Such a paradigm shift affected the construction of social perceptions and the framing of narratives; it may influence policy making, political communication, and the evolution of public debate, especially on polarizing topics. Indeed, users online tend to prefer information adhering to their worldviews, ignore dissenting information, and form polarized groups around shared narratives. Furthermore, when polarization is high, misinformation quickly proliferates.
Some argued that the veracity of the information might be used as a determinant for information spreading patterns. However, selective exposure dominates content consumption on social media, and different platforms may trigger very different dynamics. In this paper, we explore the key differences between the leading social media platforms and how they are likely to influence the formation of echo chambers and information spreading. To assess the different dynamics, we perform a comparative analysis on more than 100 million pieces of content concerning controversial topics (e.g., gun control, vaccination, abortion) from Gab, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter. The analysis focuses on two main dimensions: 1) homophily in the interaction networks and 2) bias in the information diffusion toward like-minded peers. Our results show that the aggregation in homophilic clusters of users dominates online dynamics. However, a direct comparison of news consumption on Facebook and Reddit shows higher segregation on Facebook. Furthermore, we find significant differences across platforms in terms of homophilic patterns in the network structure and biases in the information diffusion toward like-minded users. A clear-cut distinction emerges between social media having a feed algorithm tweakable by the users (e.g., Reddit) and social media that don‚Äôt provide such an option (e.g., Facebook and Twitter). Our work provides important insights into the understanding of social dynamics and information consumption on social media. The next envisioned step addresses the temporal dimension of echo chambers, to understand better how different social feedback mechanisms, specific to distinct platforms, can impact their formation.","Social media may limit the exposure to diverse perspectives and favor the formation of groups of like-minded users framing and reinforcing a shared narrative, that is, echo chambers. However, the interaction paradigms among users and feed algorithms greatly vary across social media platforms. This paper explores the key differences between the main social media platforms and how they are likely to influence information spreading and echo chambers‚Äô formation. We perform a comparative analysis of more than 100 million pieces of content concerning several controversial topics (e.g., gun control, vaccination, abortion) from Gab, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter. We quantify echo chambers over social media by two main ingredients: 1) homophily in the interaction networks and 2) bias in the information diffusion toward like-minded peers. Our results show that the aggregation of users in homophilic clusters dominate online interactions on Facebook and Twitter.

As discussed in the previous sections, choosing which method to use largely depends on the context as well as the question being asked. For example, the BART method may work well in the lab with a student population, but would be less feasible to implement in the field where access to computers is limited.

More broadly, the methods explored above highlight an important issue regarding the advantages and limitations of using experiments to elicit risk preferences. Given the level of control over the design and incentive structure, experiments are best at identifying treatment effects and differences between individuals—saying that one individual is more risk averse than another—as well as testing economic theory. The Gneezy and Potters method, for example, was effective in providing support for myopic loss aversion.
Given their stylized nature, however, experiments may not be ideal for identifying levels of risk aversion, to the extent that the estimated risk preferences and parameters may not have predictive power for behavior across domains. For example, Dohmen et al. (2011) found that a standard lottery measure that allows for the estimation of risk coefficients had little predictive power for real world, risky behavior in such domains as employment, car driving and health. Similarly, in a large-scale field study of truck drivers, Anderson et al. (2011) found that risk preferences elicited through MPL had little predictive power for economic variables like credit scores and job persistence, or non-economic behavior such as driving accidents and smoking.
In view of the limited predictive power of experimentally-elicited risk preferences across domains, sometimes the advantages of complex methods may well be outweighed by the disadvantage of decreased comprehension, and consequently, producing substantially noisier data. Simpler methods have the advantage of being more straightforward and capable of eliciting sensible risk preferences from a broader set of individuals, but similar care should be taken in extrapolating from these measures to other domains.

The quarterly journal of economics, 114(3), 817-868.","There are situations in which the standard self-interest model is unambiguously refuted. However, in other situations the predictions of this model seem to be very accurate. For example, in simple experiments like the ultimatum game, the public good game with punishments, or the gift exchange game, the vast majority of the subjects behave in a ""fair"" and ""cooperative"" manner although the self-interest model predicts very ""unfair"" and ""noncooperative"" behavior. Yet, there are also experiments like, e.g., market games or public good games without punishment, in which the vast majority of the subjects behaves in a rather ""unfair"" and ""noncooperative"" way‚Äîas predicted by the self-interest model. We show that this puzzling evidence can be explained in a coherent framework if‚Äîin addition to purely selfish people‚Äîthere is a fraction of the population that cares for equitable outcomes. Our theory is motivated by the psychological evidence on social comparison and loss aversion. It is very simple and can be applied to any game. The predictions of our model are consistent with the empirical evidence on all of the abovementioned games. Our theory also has strong empirical implications for many other games. Therefore, it is an important task for future research to test the theory more rigorously against competing hypotheses. In addition, we believe that future research should aim at formalizing the role of intentions explicitly for the n-person case.

A main insight of our analysis is that there is an important interaction between the distribution of preferences in a given population and the strategic environment. We have shown that there are environments in which the behavior of a minority of purely selfish people forces the majority of fair-minded people to behave in a completely selfish manner, too. For example, in a market game with proposer or responder competition, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for fair players to achieve a ""fair"" outcome. Likewise, in a simultaneous public good game with punishment, even a small minority of selfish players can trigger the unraveling of cooperation. Yet, we have also shown that a minority of fair-minded players can force a big majority of selfish players to cooperate fully in the public good game with punishment. Similarly, our examination of the gift exchange game indicates that fairness considerations may give rise to stable wage rigidity despite the presence of strong competition among the workers. Thus, competition may or may not nullify the impact of equity considerations. If, despite the presence of competition, single individuals have opportunities to affect the relative material payoffs, equity considerations will affect market outcomes even in very competitive environments. In our view, these results suggest that the interaction between the distribution of preferences and the economic environment deserves more attention in future research.
","There is strong evidence that people exploit their bargaining power in competitive markets but not in bilateral bargaining situations. There is also strong evidence that people exploit free-riding opportunities in voluntary cooperation games. Yet, when they are given the opportunity to punish free riders, stable cooperation is maintained, although punishment is costly for those who punish. This paper asks whether there is a simple common principle that can explain this puzzling evidence. We show that if some people care about equity the puzzles can be resolved. It turns out that the economic environment determines whether the fair types or the selfish types dominate equilibrium behavior.","1",0,"1","Apolitical",4,1

American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, 3(1), 157-179.","By studying immigrants, we are able to credibly disentangle cultural determinants of preferences for redistribution from economic and institutional determinants. We find that individuals‚Äô preferences for redistribution are strongly affected by preferences in their countries of birth: the average preference for income redistribution in the culture where an immigrant is raised continues to have an effect once they emigrate. This effect is highly statistically significant, economically important, and robust to rich controls for economic factors and to the choice of sample and specification. Our results show that these cultural influences also affect real behaviors, such as voting. Cultural determinants of preferences for redistribution appear to be strongly persistent across generations. We also find that the cultural effect is stronger for immigrants who are less politically or socially assimilated into the destination country and for immigrants who migrate to more diverse destination countries.

At a fundamental level, this paper provides evidence on the nature of preferences for redistribution. We find that these preferences cannot be fully explained by economic self-interest or by economic, political, or social aspects of the current environment, since individual preferences continue to be influenced by country of origin even in a common environment. We take this as evidence that culture is an important determinant of preferences for redistribution.

At a more applied level, this finding has three important implications. First, it suggests that culture may be an important factor in explaining the large observed differences in systems of redistribution across countries. Second, it implies persistence in preferences for redistribution. This persistence means that in settings with multiple equilibria for the amount of redistribution (e.g., as in Thomas Piketty 1995), we are unlikely to observe a sudden shift from one equilibrium to another, which underscores the importance of those factors that determine the selection of the initial equilibrium. Third, while our primary focus is on using immigrants as a mechanism to identify the effects of culture, our findings shed light on the political economy of immigration policy because the cultural values that immigrants bring along can shape the social policies of their destination countries well into the future. Even if the immigrants themselves have little effect on current policy (e.g., because they are not allowed to vote), the transmission of their cultural values to their children can affect future policy and have a lasting impact.
","Is culture an important determinant of preferences for redistribution? To separate culture from the economic and institutional environment (‚Äúcontext‚Äù), we relate immigrants‚Äô redistributive preferences to the average preference in their birth countries. We find a strong positive relationship that is robust to rich controls for economic factors and cannot easily be explained by selective migration. This effect is as large as that of own household income and appears stronger for those less assimilated into the destination country. Immigrants from high-preference countries are more likely to vote for more pro-redistribution parties. The effect of culture persists strongly into the second generation.","6",1,"6","Political",4,0

Journal of the European Economic Association, 11(3), 525-47.","Summing up our observations we find that the pattern of lying does not change when stakes, consequences or anonymity is altered. We always observe liars, honest subjects, and some subjects who lie partially. A model of absolute lying aversion can explain the monotonically increasing pattern of our results. By assuming some heterogeneity in the subjects‚Äô disutility of lying it is possible to model the observed behavior of income-maximizing subjects as well as that of honest subjects. Nevertheless, the model fails to explain the observed pattern of partial cheating. Something prevents some people from lying fully. Using a double anonymous procedure, we were able to show that people do not care particularly about the experimenter‚Äôs judgment, but that it is possible that they try to uphold a favorable self-concept.

In daily life, it is important to be ready to tell compelling lies if ever somebody will doubt the truth of a story. Not lying maximally might leave more space for arguing that one has indeed been honest. If ever anybody is called upon to tell what he has done in our experiment, the person who can say he reported a 4 with a clear conscience might seem more credible. By not reporting a 5 one obviously is not completely greedy and income-maximizing. Reporting a number below 5 might be below the radar of an internal or external moral detection radar. The true type and motivation can be disguised and the signal of probably being an honest person can be upheld because one can claim to not having lied like a true liar.

We presented our method for the first time in 2007, and the working paper has been circulating since 2008. The design is a new type of experiment with the potential to be used in further innovative settings. There is now some literature that uses this design for different research questions. For example, Conrads et al. (2011) have used it in order to investigate team incentives, and Suri, Goldstein, and Mason (2011) implemented the game in an online labor market. In a variant of the game, the die was covered in a cup in order to increase the credibility that the experimenter cannot observe the outcome (Shalvi, Handgraaf, and De Dreu 2010; Lewis et al., 2012). Bucciol and Piovesan (2011) use a coin instead of a die, a method which has also been used by Houser, Vetter, and Winter (2012), Abeler, Becker, and Falk (2012), and Cohn, Marechal, and Noll (2012). The latter two studies extend our study in an important way since they address other subject pools than students. Finally, Greene and Paxton (2009) instructed people to predict the outcome of a random device and asked them to report their guess after the random draw was executed. This method has the advantage that lying is impossible to observe and it is particularly useful in fMRI studies because the subject does not need to operate the random device.

As we were unable to find a definitive explanation for the observed fraction of reported 4s, it also leaves open the interesting question of disguised lies. Several theories of self-concept and self-reputation have the potential to provide ideas for further applications of this design. Empirically, one has to address whether people only lie upward or whether they are even willing to report a lower number in order to appear honest. Finally, we now know the pattern of lying but we do not know yet how credible these lies are. It would be interesting to analyze how lying is related to trust and trustworthiness and whether people not lying maximally are assessed as being more trustworthy than those lying fully. Since we hypothesize disguise to be an important motive for partial lying, experiments in which subjects assess the credibility of others‚Äô lies are a natural next step.","We present a novel experimental design to measure honesty and lying. Participants receive a die which they roll privately. Since their payoff depends on the reported roll of the die, the subjects have an incentive to be dishonest and report higher numbers to get a higher payoff. This design has three advantages. First, cheating cannot be detected on the individual level, which reduces potential demand effects. Second, the method is very easy to implement. Third, the underlying true distribution of the outcome under full honesty is known, and hence it is possible to test different theoretical predictions. We find that about 20% of inexperienced subjects lie to the fullest extent possible while 39% of subjects are fully honest. In addition, a high share of subjects consists of partial liars; these subjects lie, but do not report the payoff-maximizing draw. We discuss different motives that explain the observed behavioral pattern.

The American Economic Review, 85(5), 1313-26.","My analysis of behavior in an abstract game leads me to believe that the structure of the game is favorable for the study of thought processes of actual players. In the first period the behavior deviates strongly from game-theoretic solutions. Furthermore, the distribution of the chosen numbers over the [0, 100] interval in sessions with different parameters were significantly different. I have proposed a theory of boundedly rational behavior in which the ‚Äò‚Äòdepths of reasoning‚Äô‚Äô are of importance. The results indicate that, starting from initial reference point 50, iteration steps 1 and 2 play a significant role, that is, most of the observations are in the neighborhood of 50p or 50p¬≤, independent of the parameter p. This result accounts for the difference of the distributions of the chosen numbers for different parameter values p.

Thus, the theory of boundedly rational behavior for the first period deviates in several ways from the game-theoretic reasoning:

(i) I suggested that the ‚Äò‚Äòreference point‚Äô‚Äô or starting point for the reasoning process is 50 and not 100. The process is driven by iterative, naive best replies rather than by an elimination of dominated strategies.
(ii) The process of iteration is finite and not infinite.
(iii) I apply the same theory for p > 1 and p < 1, whereas game-theoretic reasoning is different for those parameter sets.

Over time the chosen numbers approach an equilibrium or converge to it. In the 4/3 sessions, the choice 100 is the best reply in all periods but the first. In the third and fourth period more than 50 percent of the subjects choose this strategy. In the sessions with p < 1, there is a moving target, which approaches zero. I apply the theory of first-round behavior also to the subsequent periods 2‚Äì4, using as the initial reference point the mean of the previous period. I find that the modal choices are around iteration step 2, and the majority of observations remain below step 3. In most sessions, the best reply is within step 2 in periods 1‚Äì3. I cannot accept the hypothesis of increasing iteration steps, and I suggest that another explanation of the observed behavior may be more adequate for periods 2‚Äì4. I propose a qualitative learning-direction theory which predicts that a subject tends to increase his adjustment factor in the direction of the optimal adjustment factor if it was below the optimal one and tends to decrease the adjustment factor if it was above the optimal one. A similar kind of simple learning theory has been applied successfully in other experiments.","(no abstract)","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,1

Vol. 191, pp. 946-964. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2021.09.018","Individuals commonly engage in behaviors that constitute a trade-off between self-serving and other-regarding goals. Typically, the trade-offs experienced by a person is subject to observation by peers. Most social encounters in natural and online environments involve observation of shared characteristics. As such, decision-making embodies concerns related to social signaling, self-signaling, and future reciprocity. Additionally, observability is argued to affect the degree of altruism both directly (through economic incentives following from reputation concerns) and indirectly (through social incentives following from image concerns). Empirically, however, disentangling these channels is difficult because they rarely appear in isolation. Overwhelmingly, past studies of observability have focused on its impact on decisions in the pro-social domain alone (Bradley et al., 2018). To make matters more complicated, the trade-offs involved are often embedded in strategic environments in which individual and social welfare can be influenced by observers.

A natural starting point to look for a clean effect is the laboratory and online environment. In these settings, the constraints of interest are absent, while incentives and observability of behavior can be precisely controlled. This enabled us to tease out the mechanisms and test the (in)effectiveness of our interventions. Our series of studies aim to address these aspects and advance our scientific understanding of how, why, and when a seemingly simple behavioral intervention to achieve behavioral change does (not) work and‚Äîimportantly, from a policy point of view‚Äîwhat to do with these findings. For this reason, we study the impact of observability (in various forms and differing consequences) in both the pro- and anti-social domains and systematically dissect the different channels at play. We capitalize on both a laboratory and online setting to explore the mechanisms at play in greater detail. Our analysis is backed by testable hypotheses using predictions for the following distinct drivers of behavior: self-interest, altruism/warm-glow, social image, and inequality aversion. Broadly speaking, we predict that reciprocal reputation mechanisms will be most effective at curbing anti-social behavior and promoting pro-social behavior, whereas the benefits of social image observation alone can be eroded and even outmatched by inequality concerns.

With that, in addition to examining when and how backfiring occurs, the combination of all treatments across the laboratory and online settings allows us to shed light on (i) the reasons for such backfiring and (ii) ways to counteract it. For (i), we are motivated by the literature on inequality concerns in conjunction with the hypothesis that the focus of such concerns is a function of whether or not one‚Äôs actions are observed and by whom. We present evidence that this is a likely channel for the observed backfiring effect. For (ii), we test the hypothesis that nudging people to think about a descriptive norm of what others do affects the efficacy of the observation intervention as suggested by Cialdini et al. (1990, 1991) and instrumentalized by Krupka and Weber (2009), which turns out to be highly effective. Altogether, we can conclude that in situations where both pro- and anti-social behaviors are possible, increasing the observability of one‚Äôs actions can have little or even detrimental effects when monetary consequences are absent. Relying on one‚Äôs social image consideration alone can be insufficient, which is consistent with the finding that even extremely ‚Äònice‚Äô behavior might not be regarded as such (Klein et al., 2015).

The approach of varying observability and accountability also falls under the umbrella term of nudges and is frequently employed to produce behavioral change (e.g., Allcott, 2011; Bicchieri and Dimant, 2019; DellaVigna and Linos, 2020; Hallsworth et al., 2016; Lacetera and Macis, 2010). With that, our findings have direct policy relevance. Policymakers need to be aware of this potential backfiring effect. Our results can guide them in two respects. First, our results on the role of inequality seem to indicate that the observability nudge should work for relatively well-off people as pro-social behavior here reduces inequality. It may also serve as some kind of conspicuous consumption. In contrast, backfiring may be present when the nudge is applied to those who are less well off. Second, we detect a crucial aspect concerning the salience of social norms, which achieves a reversal of the strongly detrimental impact of the pure observability nudge. Our takeaway is that in situations where behavior cannot be enforced or sanctioned, increasing observability of actions should be combined with a salient norm to avoid potential backfiring effects, which‚Äîcompared to the costly introduction of formal institutions‚Äîyields a promising approach both in social and economic terms (e.g., Bicchieri et al., 2020; Dimant and Gesche, 2020). We are confident that our comprehensive study highlights the potential pitfalls of simple nudge interventions and points to fruitful avenues for future research.","Theoretical and empirical findings suggest that individuals are sensitive to the observability of their actions and the downstream consequences of this observability. We connect three streams of literature (social preferences, behavior change, and social norms) to investigate the conditions for which these claims are valid. Across multiple high-powered studies, we examine the mechanisms through which observability of one‚Äôs actions affects pro-sociality, when and why it sometimes fails, and how to utilize social and economic incentives to enact behavior change. Our three main results are: (i) observability alone has very little positive effect and can even backfire; (ii) inequality aversion drives the observed backfiring of observability; (iii) increasing the salience of norms can mitigate unintended consequences and successfully increase pro-sociality. From a policy perspective, our results highlight the potential pitfalls of simple behavioral interventions.","4",0,"4","Political",4,0

Political Psychology, 40(2), 241 ‚Äì 260. https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.12494","In two experiments, we investigated the conditions under which partisan attitudes affect the processing of misinformation retractions. In general, across all conditions in both experiments, retractions tended to be more effective if they retracted attitude-dissonant misinformation. This is in line with theoretical accounts of motivated reasoning and the cultural cognition thesis (Hart et al., 2009; Kahan, 2010, 2013; Kruglanski & Webster, 1996; Kunda, 1990; Taber & Lodge, 2006). Confirming a hypothesis specified by Ecker, Lewandowsky, Fenton, et al. (2014), Experiment 1 found that partisan attitudes affected retraction processing predominantly if the misinformation was of a general nature, such that accepting the retraction would require a certain amount of attitudinal change. In this case (i.e., in the context of Experiment 1, in Liberal participants), an attitude-dissonant retraction was ineffective (the apparent backfire effect was significant only when excluding participants with poor memory for the materials) in line with Nyhan and Reifler (2010). Experiment 2 replicated the pattern found in the general-scenario condition of Experiment 1 closely; while the backfire effect was now clearly absent, an attitude-dissonant retraction was still found to be entirely ineffective in Liberal participants. By contrast, retractions across both experiments were consistently effective in Labor participants. In sum, one can conclude that partisan attitudes generally affect the processing of misinformation retractions, but the partisan attitude effects seem somewhat stronger on the political right, where attitude-dissonant retractions were found consistently ineffective. This supports the view that conservative minds are particularly prone to worldview effects when processing contentious information (Jost, 2017; Jost et al., 2003; Nam et al., 2013; Prasad et al., 2009). This might best be explained by the notion that worldview effects are mediated by the negative emotional impact of self-concept threatening corrections, combined with the assumption that conservatives are (1) particularly susceptible to such threats (Carraro et al., 2011; Fessler et al., 2017; Hibbing et al., 2014; Trevors et al., 2016) and (2) generally less likely to engage with worldview-dissonant information based on their greater need for certainty, ambiguity intolerance, and closed-mindedness (Carney et al., 2008; Fibert & Ressler, 1998; Jost, 2017; Price et al., 2015).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to test for partisan-attitude effects on information processing using entirely parallel materials for participants supporting left-leaning and right-leaning parties. However, an obvious limitation of this study is that only one particular topic‚Äîmisconduct in politicians‚Äîwas used. Thus, it is possible that the observed variation in retraction effectiveness across partisan groups may relate to the specific topic used in this study. For example, an alternative explanation of the result pattern could be derived from Crawford‚Äôs (2012) ideologically objectionable premise model. This model assumes that judgments can be biased by political attitudes across the spectrum, but that the judgment context determines whether biased judgment actually occurs. Specifically, if an individual categorically rejects the premise of a judgment, then attitudes do not lead to bias. For example, if a person thinks that in general torture can be a legitimate interrogation tool, they may be biased in their assessment of who might be justifiably tortured (e.g., a foreign terror suspect vs. a domestic crime suspect). If, however, a person rejects torture outright, they will show no bias and will be equally concerned about torture of any person. In the present context, if Liberal supporters in general found embezzlement somewhat more acceptable than Labor supporters, this may explain the observed stronger bias. This notion is of course highly speculative, in particular as it seems improbable that Liberal supporters would find embezzlement any more acceptable than Labor supporters, despite the existing partisan differences in what is morally acceptable behavior (e.g., Gallup, 2016). However, this speculation produces the testable hypothesis that in a scenario involving a behavior that right-leaning participants find categorically unacceptable but left-leaning participants find generally more acceptable, the opposite result pattern should emerge.

A second factor could be the general salience of the misinformation. There are some claims in the literature that misinformation that is more salient is more easily retracted (e.g., Ecker et al., 2017; Kendeou, Butterfuss, van Boekel, & O‚ÄôBrien, 2017; Kendeou, Walsh, Smith, & O‚ÄôBrien, 2014; Putnam, Wahlheim, & Jacoby, 2014; Stadtler, Scharrer, Brummernhenrich, & Bromme, 2013). However, to explain the observed data, this account would have to assume that misconduct in Labor politicians was a particularly unsalient topic for Liberal participants, an assumption that seems fairly implausible. Nevertheless, before drawing stronger conclusions, future research should attempt to replicate the obtained data pattern with different materials and perhaps also including more direct target measures (e.g., in the present paradigm, one could measure directly participants‚Äô evaluation of the politicians involved).

Third, it is known that motivated reasoning is particularly strong in cases where an attitude is central to a person‚Äôs identity (Brannon, Tagler, & Eagly, 2007; Hart et al., 2009). Thus, to the extent that the Liberal participants in the present study may consider their support of their preferred party as a more central aspect of their identity than the Labor participants, they would be expected to show stronger resistance to retractions that run counter to their partisan attitudes. Even though our samples were well-matched in terms of party-preference scores, this is a plausible hypothesis that cannot be entirely ruled out by the present data; future research should thus aim to disentangle the potential effects of participants‚Äô political persuasion and their strength of identification with their preferred party. This is perhaps best done in a representative sample, as it is unclear to what extent young adults, such as the undergraduates tested in this study, have formed strong political loyalties. We also acknowledge that other potential mediators of the effect might exist.

Regarding the question of whether or not the worldview-backfire effect observed in some studies but not others is a reliable phenomenon, the present research cannot provide a conclusive answer. A numerical backfire effect was obtained in Experiment 1, although it was statistically significant only when excluding participants with poor memory for the materials, and no evidence for backfire was found in Experiment 2. It thus seems that the worldview-backfire effect is a ‚Äúreal‚Äù phenomenon that can sometimes occur, but that is not reliably evoked (see T. Wood & Porter, in press). The present research, together with previous reports of the effect (see Cook & Lewandowsky, 2016; Nyhan & Reifler, 2010; Nyhan et al., 2013), suggests that the effect is more likely to occur in conservative people, but future research should aim to further constrain the conditions under which the effect is most likely to arise.

Another important question for future studies will be to tease apart how much of the effect, when it occurs, represents true ironic belief change and how much might reflect over-compensatory reactance. As discussed by Ecker, Lewandowsky, Fenton, et al. (2014), an effect that resembles a worldview-backfire effect may occur if a person (1) changes their belief in line with the corrective evidence, but (2) does not want to express this changed belief, for example out of fear of social exclusion, and then (3) overcorrects for the belief change (see Batson, 1975; Gal & Rucker, 2010).

A similar interpretation of potential backfire effects stems from work on agent-based modeling of social norm impacts (Brown, Lewandowsky, & Huang, 2018; Epstein, 2001; Marsella, Pynadath, & Read, 2004; Smaldino & Epstein, 2015). Specifically, one might assume that expressed beliefs (e.g., beliefs expressed in an experiment) are always a compromise between a person‚Äôs true belief and the perceived relevant social norm. This compromise is sought to concurrently meet the competing needs for authenticity (Wood, Linley, Maltby, Baliousis, & Joseph, 2008) and social inclusion (Hornsey & Jetten, 2004). If corrective evidence becomes available that is perceived to strongly shift the estimated social norm belief, then a compromise between a person‚Äôs true belief and the norm belief may no longer be possible. If a person then decides post-correction to express their true belief‚Äîin order to satisfy their need for authenticity while foregoing their need for social inclusion‚Äîthe correction‚Äôs effect may resemble a worldview-backfire effect even if no ironic belief change has actually occurred.","Misinformation often continues to influence people‚Äôs memory and inferential reasoning after it has been retracted; this is known as the continued influence effect (CIE). Previous research investigating the role of attitude-based motivated reasoning in this context has found conflicting results: Some studies have found that worldview can have a strong impact on the magnitude of the CIE, such that retractions are less effective if the misinformation is congruent with a person‚Äôs relevant attitudes, in which case the retractions can even backfire. Other studies have failed to find evidence for an effect of attitudes on the processing of misinformation corrections. The present study used political misinformation‚Äîspecifically fictional scenarios involving misconduct by politicians from left-wing and right-wing parties‚Äîand tested participants identifying with those political parties. Results showed that in this type of scenario, partisan attitudes have an impact on the processing of retractions, in particular (1) if the misinformation relates to a general assertion rather than just a specific singular event and (2) if the misinformation is congruent with a conservative partisanship.","2",0,"2","Political",2,0

Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, Vo. 160, pp. 100-120. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2019.02.027","Our experimental evidence replicates well-documented findings in the empirical literature that men are (i) more confident and (ii) trade more than women. However, we do not find any support for the widespread conjecture by which (i) explains (ii). The gender gap in trading activity persists when we compare men and women with the same confidence level, or after controlling for confidence in our regression analyses. Overconfidence does not help to explain any portion of the gender gap in trade volume either. In this respect, our results do not lend support to the conclusions of Barber and Odean (2001) that overconfidence is responsible for the gender gap in trading activity.

Three previous experimental studies have attempted to assess jointly the relationship between gender, overconfidence, and trading activity. However, for reasons that will become apparent below, it is difficult to draw clear conclusions from their results.

Biais et al. (2005) study miscalibration and self-monitoring (a self-assessed measure of attention to social cues and adaptation to the social environment) in an experimental market with asymmetric information. They find that subjects with high miscalibration and low self-monitoring are more likely to suffer from the winner‚Äôs curse and, consequently, earn lower profits. However, even though they find significant gender differences in trading activity, neither miscalibration nor self-monitoring differ significantly between men and women.

Deaves et al. (2008) measure three forms of overconfidence: miscalibration, better-than-average ability, and illusion of control. Better-than-average ability is measured after trading by asking subjects to guess how many people in the experiment had earned more money than themselves. Illusion of control is measured before trading by asking subjects for their level of agreement with two statements concerning their ability to detect or buy securities which will perform well in the future. In their experiment, subjects trade in several markets with asymmetric information. However, the informativeness of private signals depends on subjects‚Äô performance in the general knowledge miscalibration task. The relationship between miscalibration and subsequent trading behavior is, therefore, built into the experimental design. The authors find significant gender differences in trading activity only in sessions with a balanced gender mix. In contrast, they do not find significant gender differences in any of their overconfidence measures.

Finally, Fellner-R√∂hling and Kr√ºgel (2014) conduct experimental markets with asymmetric information after measuring participants‚Äô miscalibration (both in general knowledge and in time series forecasting) and their degree of overweighting of private signals in a prediction task. Although trading activity is significantly higher in men, no gender differences are found in any of their overconfidence measures except in the general knowledge miscalibration task, in which women are in fact more overconfident than men.

The first and most important limitation of the three experimental studies above is that neither of them observe clear gender differences in the chosen measures of confidence. In contrast with the better-than-average effect, which has been shown to vary consistently between men and women, miscalibration has not been documented to differ systematically in the same way. This raises doubts as to whether miscalibration is the right measure to explain the gender gap in trading activity. A second limitation of these studies is that experimental asset markets are typically volatile and very sensitive to the actions of a single individual. The behavior of each trader in a given market does not constitute an independent observation, which makes it difficult to make reliable ceteris paribus comparisons between men and women. This does not happen in our experiment, where prices are determined independently of the actions of traders. A third limitation is that neither of these experiments involve trading costs. In contrast, the empirical finance literature emphasizes trading costs as a key reason why trading too much is costly (Barber et al., 2009; Barber and Odean, 2000; Odean, 1999). Lastly, with the exception of the signal-based prediction task in Fellner-R√∂hling and Kr√ºgel (2014), none of the confidence measures in these studies are incentivized.

Another empirical study closely related to ours is that of Glaser and Weber (2007). In their survey of online broker investors, they find a positive correlation between trade volume and better-than-average confidence, but not with measures of miscalibration. Their study, which focuses on the role of overconfidence rather than on gender, is conducted with a sample of approximately 95% male traders. Such a small sample of women (fewer than ten) makes it impossible to obtain clear results regarding gender differences.

In our experiment, confidence does not explain why men trade so much more than women, despite large gender differences in confidence. Of course, we cannot rule out the possibility that this result is the consequence of our specific experimental design. For instance, confidence is measured in one particular way, so we cannot be sure that other forms of confidence or overconfidence could have explained the gender gap in trade volume. In addition, the trading task does not involve multi-person trading nor real stocks, which may have dampened a potential effect of (over)confidence on trading activity.

As we argued at the end of Section 3, there are important advantages to a design in which subjects do not trade amongst themselves; namely, greater experimenter control and statistical power. Furthermore, this task has been very popular in the study of the disposition effect, with a sizeable number of studies employing it following Weber and Camerer (1998). The disadvantage of our design is that it departs significantly from the standard setup in behavioral finance models of overconfidence. However, as we formally show in the Appendix, overconfidence also leads to more trade in our environment.

Notwithstanding the simplicity of our task, our findings raise the following question:
What factors, other than confidence, might explain gender differences in trading activity?

Our first approximation has been to examine gender differences in competitiveness, risk aversion, and financial literacy. However, none of these measures are able to explain a significant portion of the gender gap in trading activity. Furthermore, we control for a number of psychological and demographic variables (such as Big Five personality traits and field of studies) in our regression analysis, but do not find any change in the estimated gender difference in trade volume.

One possibility that we have not examined is that men might enjoy trading more than women do. In their survey, Dorn and Sengmueller (2009) find that traders who report that they enjoy investing and gambling trade much more frequently than the rest. They also find that men are more likely to agree with the statements ‚ÄúI enjoy investing‚Äù and ‚ÄúI enjoy taking risky positions.‚Äù Controlling for these survey responses somewhat reduces the gender gap in trading activity, although it still remains large and significant. Along similar lines, Grinblatt and Keloharju (2009) argue that, since speculative trading is a risky activity, it may be particularly attractive to sensation seekers. In support of this hypothesis, the authors find a significant positive correlation between speeding tickets (their proxy for sensation seeking) and trading activity. However, they continue to find a large gender effect and do not report how it changes by the inclusion of their sensation-seeking measure.

Sensation-seeking and gambling attitudes have been found to systematically vary by gender. For instance, Cross et al. (2011) find in a meta-analysis that men are more sensation seeking than women on both questionnaire and behavioral measures, while Salonen et al. (2017) observe that men have more positive attitudes towards gambling than women.

In a recent experimental study, Corgnet et al. (2018) find that fluid intelligence, cognitive reflection, and theory of mind are significant positive predictors of trading performance. In line with previous results in the literature, the authors also find that men outperform women on cognitive reflection (Bosch-Dom√®nech et al., 2014; Cueva et al., 2016; Frederick, 2005; Oechssler et al., 2009), while women outperform men in theory of mind (Baron-Cohen et al., 1997). In their experiment, Corgnet et al. (2018) also find that men trade significantly more than women. However, they do not explore whether gender differences in cognitive reflection or theory of mind have any explanatory power.

How much of the gender gap in trading activity can be accounted for by a combination of these measures remains an open question. However, our results suggest that future research should look beyond overconfidence.","The fact that men trade more than women in financial markets has been attributed to men‚Äôs overconfidence. However, evidence supporting this view is only indirect. We directly test this conjecture experimentally, by measuring confidence using monetary incentives before participants trade in a simulated market. We find that men are more confident than women in our trading task. Men also trade more, and they hold larger and less diversified portfolios than women. However, we do not find that differences in confidence explain any portion of the gender gap in trading activity. We explore alternative candidate channels such as risk aversion, financial literacy or competitiveness but find that these factors are also unlikely to play a role.","5",0,"5","Political",4,1

Political Psychology, 42(6), 1053‚Äì1069. https://doi. org/ 10. 1111/ pops. 12734","Our results show that how individuals process new information on migration is characterized by political biases: How individuals engage with evidence is strongly determined by their prior beliefs on the topic. This type of information-processing behavior is termed ‚Äúpolitically motivated learning‚Äù and implies that individuals are much more likely to study evidence carefully and try to find counterarguments when this evidence challenges their predispositions. Evidence that at first glance seems to support their individual predispositions remains underexamined.

We also find that politically motivated learning is stronger among those most opposed to migration. We do not want to overinterpret this result. On the one hand, it may indeed indicate a particular strong identity among people with such beliefs. If so, this finding arguably directly relates to classic studies on the ‚Äúauthoritarian personality‚Äù (Adorno, 1950) and recent research on asymmetric polarization (Morisi, Jost, & Singh, 2019). Our results could thus indicate that conservative individuals differ in systematic ways from more liberal ones. On the other hand, there are other explanations for the differences in the strength of politically motivated learning. For example, we cannot fully exclude that other characteristics associated with holding strong antimigration views‚Äîsuch as education levels or personality traits‚Äîmay explain differences in politically motivated learning. In addition, there may be specific characteristics of the current migration debate that mean that a study concluding that refugees do not increase crime is more surprising for many people than the opposite conclusion; this could also explain the patterns we find. More work is clearly needed here, and we remain reluctant to place too much weight on these differences for now.

Importantly, the covariance detection task excludes some key rival explanations for how individuals process information and respond to surveys. In an additional test, we also showed that the patterns of responses we find are not solely due to motivated political responding. However, we do find that motivated responding is one type of behavior exhibited by survey respondents, providing additional support for the results described in Sood and Khanna (2018).","Information processing during heated debates on asylum and immigration may often be influenced by prejudice rather than a desire to learn facts. In this article, we investigate how people process empirical evidence on the consequences of refugee arrivals through a novel survey experiment that disentangles politically motivated learning from other forms of learning and expressive responding. Specifically, we ask respondents to interpret a 2√ó2 table about the relationship between asylum seekers and crime rates. Crucially, respondents are randomly allocated to evaluate a conclusion that triggers their identity-protective stakes or not. In addition, we test for motivated responding as an alternative explanation by randomly providing some respondents with a response format that motivates them to report their inference truthfully.

We find that information processing changes substantially when new information challenges existing asylum attitudes. Politically motivated learning is strongest among voters with strong negative prior attitudes towards asylum seekers. Our results also indicate that expressive responding can only partially account for this gap in correctly reported inferences.

Our research has important implications for research on the consequences of refugee migration, theories of motivated reasoning, and survey methodology.

Resolving the Puzzle of Conspiracy Worldview and Political Activism: Belief in Secret Plots Decreases Normative but Increases Non-normative Political Engagement. Social Psychological and Personality Science, 12(1), 71-79. https://doi.org/10.1177/1948550619896491","Two preregistered studies in two different national contexts (Germany, United States) converge in showing a curvilinear relation between experimentally assigned (hypothetical) conspiracy worldview and the general tendency to become politically active (independent of the means). Further, a more fine-grained differentiation into normative and nonnormative means resolved this by showing that with an increase in conspiracy worldview, intentions to engage in normative, legal means decreased, whereas the willingness to commit illegal, nonnormative political acts was higher for any condition that involved any conspiracy worldview.

Both findings may provide a solution for an apparent lack of consensus in the literature as to whether conspiracy beliefs decrease or increase political intentions. Our findings suggest that they initially do (conceivably, as they increase perceptions of injustice and a perceived need to change the status quo), but only up to a certain point of conspiracy beliefs after which intention to engage politically decrease (particularly for normative forms) or stagnate (for nonnormative forms). The latter stagnation is not fully in line with a nothing-to-lose phenomenon by which nonnormative actions become more attractive, the more desperate one is and the lower one‚Äôs perceived efficacy is (Saab et al., 2016), a finding that deserves further scrutiny in future research.

Overall, our findings point to a real danger of conspiracy worldviews. Once people are convinced of them, there is no need to pay allegiance to any form of social contract, as codified in laws and regulations or implicitly agreed on in forms of trust in epistemic authorities like quality media or university scientists (Imhoff et al., 2018).

The current studies have clear limitations, the most obvious one being that participants gave hypothetical responses to a hypothetical scenario. This method allows for strict experimental control, and thus causal interpretations, but it has clear costs in terms of ecological validity and generalizability to real-life situations. The causal link we provide only speaks to the fact that taking the perspective of a conspiracy worldview makes people see violent extremism as a plausible option. At the same time, even if the effect is currently restricted to hypothetical worldview, it points to an interesting insight. Once people accept a basic belief of conspiracy believers, adopting nonnormative violent means to pursue one‚Äôs political goals becomes‚Äîif not inevitable‚Äîcertainly a seemingly logical decision to ordinary people.

This important lesson notwithstanding, future studies should provide additional evidence for the effect of conspiracy worldviews in the real world and actual radicalization processes. Ideally, scholars could follow individuals from populations with pronounced vulnerability to radicalization longitudinally and thereby trace trajectories of conspiracy worldview and political radicalization. We know from historical and current political movements that conspiracy rhetoric plays a pivotal role in prominent terrorist organizations and other political movements who endorsed the use of violence (Bartlett & Miller, 2010). Our study is the first to establish experimentally: Under the impression that the world is governed by conspiracies, virtually anyone would see it as more likely to engage in nonnormative political acts.","It is a hitherto open and debated question whether the belief in conspiracies increases or attenuates the willingness to engage in political action. In the present article, we tested the notion, whether (a) the relation between belief in conspiracies and general political engagement is curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) and (b) there may be opposing relations to normative versus nonnormative forms of political engagement. Two preregistered experiments (N = 194, N = 402) support both propositions and show that the hypothetical adoption of a worldview that sees the world as governed by secret plots attenuates reported intentions to participate in normative, legal forms of political participation but increases reported intentions to employ nonnormative, illegal means of political articulation. These results provide first evidence for the notion that political extremism and violence might seem an almost logical conclusion when seeing the world as governed by conspiracies.","4",0,"4","Political",4,0
170,56,"Differences Between Lifelong Singles and Ever-Partnered Individuals in Big Five Personality Traits and Life Satisfaction (Stern et al., 2024)","We investigated personality-trait differences between lifelong singles and ever-partnered individuals in middle and older adulthood. Specification-curve analyses indicated that lifelong singles are lower in extraversion, conscientiousness, and life satisfaction. Effects were strongest when defining lifelong singles as never-partnered individuals, and they were weakest (but still evident) in never-married individuals. Results for openness depended on lifelong singlehood definitions. Exploratory analyses suggested that never-married individuals (with other lifelong singles excluded) were less agreeable than ever-married individuals, but results for agreeableness were mostly null. Country-level singlehood and gender ratios, as well as individuals‚Äô age and gender, were considerable factors moderating the size of group differences in neuroticism and life satisfaction. Higher income was associated with smaller differences in conscientiousness between groups.
Our findings are in line with previous studies investigating current or younger lifelong singles (e.g., Luhmann et al., 2012; Neyer & Lehnart, 2007). Group differences could be explained by selection effects; people higher in extraversion, conscientiousness, and life satisfaction are more likely to enter a relationship (B√ºhler et al., 2024; Chopik et al., 2023; Wagner et al., 2015) ‚Äîdifferences that may endure across the life span. There might also be socialization effects; group differences could be driven by personality change through relationship transitions. However, these socialization effects have been found to be rather rare, short-term, and dependent on individual relationship quality (B√ºhler et al., 2023, 2024; Lucas & Clark, 2006; Lucas et al., 2003). We found within-group differences between singles, because never-partnered individuals were lower in openness compared with ever-partnered individuals, but there were no differences for never-cohabitating or never-married individuals. These results show that the definition of singlehood matters, and differences in that definition could explain mixed findings in previous studies. People higher in openness are more likely to enter a relationship (B√ºhler et al., 2024), and they might be more open to less normative relationship forms, such as living apart together.
We did not find simple group differences between lifelong singles and ever-partnered individuals in neuroticism, as reported by studies focusing on current or younger lifelong singles (Hoan & MacDonald, 2024; Neyer & Lehnart, 2007). Sample characteristics might explain these discrepancies. Lifelong singles were more neurotic compared with ever-partnered individuals when they were younger, male, and in countries with higher proportions of singles or men. These effects might be explained by the normativity of being in a relationship that likely differs across the investigated variables (B√ºhler et al., 2024; Neyer et al., 2014), which future research should investigate. Our finding of no group differences in agreeableness is consistent with previous findings that agreeableness does not play a role in relationship formation and is not affected by relationship life events (B√ºhler et al., 2024). Nevertheless, the finding from distinct group analyses that never-married individuals (with never-cohabitating and never-partnered people excluded), are less agreeable is in contrast to previous research reporting that lower agreeableness predicts marriage (Asselmann & Specht, 2020).
Implications and directions for future research
Our findings indicate mean-level differences in life satisfaction and some Big Five traits between lifelong singles and ever-partnered individuals. Our study contributes to a foundation for future research on well-being and personality sequelae of lifelong singlehood. Future research should adopt a within-group perspective to understand individual differences among lifelong singles and their unique experiences (Girme et al., 2023; Park et al., 2023). Longitudinal studies would enable investigation of the codevelopment of personality and well-being in lifelong singles, because personality explains substantial variance in well-being (Steel et al., 2008). Further, investigations of our results for younger cohorts are needed. More recent cohorts likely differ from older cohorts in norms and acceptance of singlehood, given that the importance of marriage for well-being is declining, that more people choose to stay single, and that younger cohorts report lower importance of partnership for happiness (Bellani et al., 2017; Scheling & Richter, 2021). This potential change in cultural norms may affect the relationship between lifelong singlehood and individual differences, especially in life satisfaction.
Our findings suggest that lifelong singlehood definitions, as well as societal factors across countries, contribute to group differences. Differences between singles and ever-partnered individuals were largest in never-partnered individuals. Further, the effect of singles self-reporting lower life satisfaction was less robust for never-married and never-cohabitating singles (with never-partnered singles excluded). Thus, lower life satisfaction in (lifelong) singles might not be predominantly driven by separated people (as argued by DePaulo & Morris, 2005; Johnson & Wu, 2002). Experiencing the dynamics of past partnership could affect personality and life satisfaction (Lehnart et al., 2010; Wagner et al., 2015). Still, not having experienced cohabitation or marriage (but having experienced a committed relationship) seems to also make a difference for life satisfaction in many singles. Future research should investigate the lasting effects of previous relationships or singlehood length.
Country-level religiosity did not show moderating effects, and the other country-level variables were only important for some traits (e.g., neuroticism), suggesting that lifelong singlehood might be a similar experience across most European countries. Nevertheless, effects could be different for countries with even stronger norms of cohabitation and marriage. Finally, as people age, they are more likely to face health issues, and social support becomes increasingly important. In never-partnered individuals, this support cannot stem from partners, but singles might be more connected to friends (Sarkisian & Gerstel, 2016). It is crucial to investigate whether this is evident for older, lifelong singles, or whether this growing group of individuals needs specific interventions. Future research should also examine how parenthood shapes singlehood.
Limitations
Limitations include the cross-sectional design, which constrains investigations of dynamics; it also makes it harder to disentangle selection from socialization effects, as well as age from cohort effects (B√ºhler & Nikitin, 2020). Further, we relied on specific assessments available in the panel study, including a short measure of the Big Five that did not include finer-grained personality facets (Hoan & MacDonald, 2024). Such short-form measures of broad trait domains cannot assess the constructs‚Äô breadth, resulting in underrepresentation of some trait components (Cred√© et al., 2012). A combination of self- and other reports might have provided more accurate estimates of people‚Äôs traits. Further, well-being domains more structurally tied to relationship status (e.g., sexual satisfaction) appear more strongly related to singlehood versus partnership (Hoan & MacDonald, 2024). Please also note that the generalizability of our findings is potentially limited to people over 50 years of age from European countries. Finally, exact causal pathways and mechanisms‚Äîsuch as reasons for lower life satisfaction in lifelong singles and resulting possibilities for interventions‚Äîremain unclear.
Conclusion
In a large-scale panel study spanning 27 countries, we found robust evidence that lifelong singles in middle to older adulthood are less extraverted, conscientious, and satisfied with their lives compared with ever-partnered individuals. Never-partnered individuals, but not never-cohabitating or never-married individuals, self-reported lower openness. Country-level and individual-level variables moderated differences in neuroticism. Our study is one step to understanding characteristics and needs of the growing group of lifelong singles, and it opens up new research questions. Future studies should capture a within-group perspective while developing knowledge about lifelong singles‚Äô social-support networks.","Being romantically partnered is widely seen as a societal norm, and has been shown to be positively associated with important life outcomes, such as physical and mental health. However, the percentage of singles is steadily increasing, with more people staying single for life.

We used the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (N = 77,064, ‚â•50 years, 27 countries) to investigate Big Five personality traits and life satisfaction in lifelong singles as compared to ever-partnered individuals. Specification curve analyses suggested that lifelong singles were less extraverted, less conscientious, less open to experiences, and less satisfied with their lives. Effects were stronger for never partnered than for never cohabitating or never married individuals, and partly moderated by gender, age, country-level singlehood, and gender ratio.

Our study provides insights into the characteristics of lifelong singles, and has implications for understanding mental health and structures of social support in older individuals.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,1
171,56,"s Mansplaining Gendered? The Effects of Unsolicited, Generic, and Prescriptive Advice on U.S. Women (Santoro & Markus, 2024)","What is it about certain cross-gender interactions that evoke the complaint of mansplaining? Five studies investigating mansplaining in the context of advice during ‚Äútroubles talk‚Äù provide the initial empirical answer. Inspired by popular accounts by women (Enthoven, 2018; Larson, 2019; Solnit, 2012), we operationalized mansplaining in the domain of advice-giving as unsolicited, generic, and prescriptive recommendations‚Äîwhat we referred to as unresponsive advice. After first showing that U.S.-based women perceive that men give this type of advice more often than women (pilot study), we found that women feel less respected, powerful, trusting, and listened to and have a smaller size of self when receiving unresponsive advice compared to being asked responsive questions from men in both real and hypothetical interactions (Studies 1 and 2). The negative effects of unresponsive advice on these self-perception outcomes were similar in magnitude regardless of the gender of the advice giver (Studies 3 and 4) and held when using responsive advice instead of responsive questions as a comparison condition (Study 4). What was influenced by the advice giver‚Äôs gender, however, was that women anticipated greater stereotype threat‚Äîor being concerned that their gender influenced the interaction‚Äîonly when men, but not when women, gave unresponsive advice.
This series of studies makes several important contributions. First, heeding calls by psychologists to study mansplaining (Johnson et al., 2021), we studied it in the context of advice and discussing problems (Tannen, 1990). Our manipulations drew not only on vignettes but also a live interaction study with scripted conversations to investigate how women feel when receiving unresponsive advice. However, given that the advice giver‚Äôs gender did not influence the effects of unresponsive advice on the self-perceptions assessed here but did influence anticipated stereotype threat, the question of the precise ways in which mansplaining may be gendered remains open, as the article‚Äôs title suggests, and points to the value of further investigation. Second, we advance the literature on responsiveness during interpersonal interactions. We showed that partner (un)responsiveness, as operationalized by how advice is given, affects interpersonal outcomes beyond liking (Huang et al., 2017) such as feeling respected and powerful. Third, we add to the literature on stereotype threat (Schmader et al., 2015; Steele, 2011) by showing that women anticipate feeling that they will be seen through the lens of gender in brief cross-gender advice-giving interactions. This complements recent findings suggesting women experience stereotype threat when receiving dependency-oriented help from men (Lee et al., 2023).
These initial studies of unresponsive advice are not without important limitations. First, on the basis of primary accounts made by women (Enthoven, 2018; Larson, 2019; Solnit, 2012), we strove to characterize and study a constellation of behaviors that we believe capture women‚Äôs experience of being given unresponsive advice. Future work might test which combination of these factors (or others not examined here, such as tone of voice) drove our effects. Second, we studied mansplaining only in the context of giving generic or obvious advice, and future work would benefit from studying mansplaining in other domains such as providing an obvious explanation (Solnit, 2012). Third, our only live-conversation study was over text between men and women, and in that study we did not measure women‚Äôs actual experience of stereotype threat. Future work might look at cross- and same-gender face-to-face interactions and measure women‚Äôs actual experience of stereotype threat. Fourth, our findings are limited to our sample: U.S.-based women recruited from convenience samples who are mostly White, college-educated and liberal. Studying men and those outside of the gender binary, as well as looking at advice interactions across other status or power divides (e.g., Harari et al., 2022), for example, would help broaden the theoretical implications of this work.
Our results show that many of the negative effects of unresponsive advice on self-perceptions seem to have been driven by the characteristics of the advice (i.e., being unresponsive) rather than by those of the advice giver (i.e., their gender). This is consistent with past research on advice (MacGeorge et al., 2016). Notably, however, unresponsive advice from men uniquely increased women‚Äôs anticipated stereotype threat, thereby raising the possibility that women are seeing themselves as lesser and one-down. Although people operating under the threat of a stereotype typically do not believe or internalize the threat (Schmader et al., 2015; Steele, 2011)‚Äîwhich likely explains why the advice giver‚Äôs gender did not influence the effects of unresponsive advice on immediate self-perceptions‚Äîthey often are more distracted and perform less well (Wu & Cai, 2023). Future research should look at the related downstream consequences of unsolicited, generic, and prescriptive recommendations, including women‚Äôs memory of their interactions, their motivation and performance on subsequent tasks. Future work should also probe the effects of unresponsive advice on women‚Äôs perceptions of gender inequality now and in the future (see Study 3). While the advice giver‚Äôs gender may not amplify the effects of unresponsive advice on women‚Äôs self-perceptions, at least not immediately, it may influence their perspectives about the world and their place in it. In doing so, unresponsive advice, and mansplaining more broadly, may perpetuate a hierarchy in which men are accorded more status than women (Karpowitz & Mendelberg, 2014; Ridgeway, 2011).
Our studies add to the literature examining the effects of conversation on inclusion and societal divides (Muragishi et al., 2023; Santoro & Markus, 2023) by highlighting the understudied phenomenon of mansplaining in the context of advice-giving in the United States. This research suggests women will feel more respected, powerful, listened to, trusting and‚Äîwhen interacting with men in particular‚Äîless anticipated stereotype threat if, instead of receiving an immediate response replete with generic and prescriptive advice, they receive a responsive question or a tailored, solicited suggestion.","In light of popular accounts in the United States of ‚Äúmansplaining,‚Äù we investigated the effects on women when others give them ‚Äúunresponsive‚Äù advice (i.e., unsolicited, generic, and prescriptive recommendations). We show using both vignettes (Study 1) and live interactions (Study 2) that unresponsive advice (vs. responsive questions) from men negatively affected women‚Äôs self-perceptions, leaving them feeling less respected, powerful, and trusting and having a smaller size of self. The advice giver‚Äôs gender did not moderate these self-perception outcomes (Study 3), although women anticipated greater stereotype threat only when men, and not when women, gave them unresponsive advice. Similar effects were found using responsive advice instead of questions as the comparison condition (Study 4). Overall, these findings (N = 4,394 U.S. adult women) suggest that it is the unresponsive nature of advice‚Äîand for certain outcomes the advice giver‚Äôs gender‚Äîthat explain its effects on women. They point to the value of a responsive suggestion or question during conversations, particularly during cross-gender ones.","2",0,"2","Political",2,1
172,56,"One is the loneliest number: Involuntary celibacy (incel), mental health, and loneliness (Sparks et al., 2024)","The novelty of the present study offers several suggestions to better understand the experiences of incels, an understudied group. Similar to Sparks et al. (2022), incels reported a pattern of increased rates‚Äîboth in general and relative to their male comparisons‚Äîof mental health issues. These were moderately to strongly associated with incels‚Äô lower levels of social support and higher feelings of loneliness. Although these were not uniquely predictive of being an incel, it highlights the potential importance of having social support, particularly in the face of romantic rejection (which incels experience to a large degree; Sparks et al., 2022), in potentially buffering against detrimental mental health outcomes. It also indicates that many of the qualitative works that have been done on incel forums have either missed or minimized the loneliness theme that was identified by Maxwell et al. (2020), which may be key to the incel experience. Although it was expected that incels would report worse mental health, lower levels of social support, and greater perceptions of loneliness than their non-incel peers, what is particularly stunning is the magnitude of differences between the two groups given that data was collected in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic‚Äîa period that has seen elevated rates of depression, anxiety, and isolation across general populations (Pfefferbaum & North, 2020; Pierce et al., 2020; Vigo et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). While the pandemic undoubtedly has a deleterious effect on the well-being of incels as well, it is possible that its effects actually minimized the differences between incels and non-incels. For instance, non-incels on average scored around the scale midpoint for loneliness, considerably higher than figures reported by individuals in France, Germany, and the Netherlands prior to the pandemic (De Jong Gierveld & Van Tilburg, 2010).

Despite the significant differences between incels and non-incels on virtually every metric, only two uniquely predicted incel group membership when all were entered simultaneously in a binary logistic regression: avoidant attachment and perceived mate value. This is somewhat similar to Sparks et al. (2022) where secure attachment and self-esteem emerged as the lone predictors of incel status. What is interesting in the present study is that self-esteem was close to emerging as a unique predictor (95% CIs: 0.96, 3.12), suggesting that it may be distinct from perceived mate value and that the latter is a more specific barometer for incels, as it is effectively a domain-specific measure of self-efficacy. That a form of attachment has again emerged as one of the few unique predictors of inceldom (low levels of secure attachment in Sparks et al. (2022), high levels of avoidant attachment in this study) suggests that this is a central feature that has been overlooked in academic and media analyses of incels. Given what has been discussed about incels, attachment researchers would likely not be surprised by the findings of the present study, as depictions of women as devious, conniving, and untrustworthy certainly reflect an insecure attachment style (Baele et al., 2021; Jones, 2020; O‚ÄôMalley et al., 2020). This portrayal of women as shallow and unavailable is a somewhat ironic twist, given the reluctance of avoidantly attached persons to form close emotional bonds, which appears to be a central feature of incels.

The emergence of insecure attachment as a key issue among incels has been discussed primarily as a barrier to forming romantic or sexual relationships or as a potential contributor to incel views of women. However, it is also worth noting that their low levels of secure attachment in particular may also impact their platonic relationships with others and contribute to their feelings of loneliness and lack of social support. Indeed, strong relationships were found between secure attachment, loneliness, and social support. A recent longitudinal study by Loeb et al. (2021) has also found that attachment insecurity at age 14 is associated with later difficulties in receiving support from friends later in adolescence. Further, the relationship between insecure attachment and negative interactions with romantic partners was partially mediated by peer social support. This suggests that negative romantic interactions are the result of an interaction between insecure attachment and poor peer support, which may have implications for future incel research, particularly as involuntary celibacy researchers have long indicated that these issues are persistent and enduring over time (Donnelly et al., 2001).

One intriguing finding that emerged was the endorsement of the ‚Äúventing‚Äù coping strategy, the lone healthy mechanism that incels utilized more frequently than their non-incel peers. Initially, this appears at odds to the other pattern of results, where incels report feeling alone and lacking social support, ostensible prerequisites to engage in venting. However, it is possible that this is referencing their use of incel and parallel forums as therapeutic spaces. In this vein, Helm et al. (2022) found that incels on Reddit often share their experiences and seek support through emotional expressions of frustration, loneliness, and hopelessness. That incels were recruited from incel-adjacent forums for this study strengthens this possibility. Multiple studies have indicated that online venting is not only common, but beneficial as well (Utz & Breuer, 2017; Vermeulen et al., 2018). There may even be social benefits; Wendorf and Yang (2015) found that online venting mediated the relationship between perceived stress and relationship maintenance, suggesting that online disclosure of personal problems may motivate individuals to invest more in their online friendships. An analysis of teenage Reddit use and mental health during the pandemic indicated that users were more likely to express more specific negative emotions and mental health issues in specific subreddits, suggesting that they may be more likely to share personal details in a community that may be more supportive or receptive to this information (Zhang et al., 2021). However, recent work by Himawan et al. (2021) on single men found that support received online was not associated with their life satisfaction or feelings of loneliness.

Despite these positive outcomes, it is important to note that Costello et al. (2022a) found that forum use actually predicted higher mean levels of anxiety. This has obvious relevance to the incel community, who saw their incel-specific subreddits, such as r/Incel, r/Braincel, and r/IncelWithoutHate shut down by Reddit over a period of three years. It also has implications for our interpretation of incel discourse on these forums. If incels lack real-world friends and social supports and are using online forums as avenues for the expression of negative emotions as a form of release or catharsis without regard for political (or even moral) correctness rather than rallying cries for an ideology, such a frame of reference must be taken into account when interpreting such discussions (see Neitzel & Welzer, 2012 and their use of reference frames when analyzing recorded conversation between National Socialist POWs in World War II).
","Incels‚Äîa ragtag collection of young males who have rallied around their shared experience of romantic rejection‚Äîhave slowly emerged as an online group of interest to researchers, no doubt as a result of several high-profile attacks. Much of this work has centered around incels‚Äô dating experiences, sexual attitudes, and online forums. However, it is possible that their moniker, short for involuntary celibate, has resulted in an overemphasis on their sexual exclusion and frustration. Recent work has identified social isolation as a key aspect of inceldom, which may help explain why incels have responded negatively to romantic rejection.

The present study thus sought to examine the role of social support and loneliness in experiences of rejection in a sample of incel (n=67) and non-incel (n=103) men. Results indicated that incels experience more feelings of loneliness and less social support than non-incel men. Both of these variables were associated with multiple mental and relational health issues that incels also scored more highly on. Further, incels reported using more solitary and problematic coping mechanisms. These results suggest that incels may be missing a key buffer in sheltering them from the adverse effects of romantic rejection. It also extends previous findings highlighting the importance of attachment styles in differentiating incels from non-incels, which may perpetuate feelings of isolation. Implications for how this may relate to incel discourse and clinical interventions are discussed.

173,56,"Attraction to politically extreme users on social media (Zimmerman et al., 2024)","The goal of the current project was to examine the occurrence of acrophily‚Äîattraction to extremes‚Äîon social media. In study 1, we conducted an online preregistered experiment where participants evaluated either politically moderate or extreme user profiles and were asked whether they were likely to follow them. We found that participants preferred extreme copartisans over moderate ones. In study 2, we looked at retweet behavior of a large user sample on Twitter. We found that liberals tended to retweet users that were on average more extreme than pure homophily but less extreme than just acrophily. Conservatives‚Äô strategy, however, was even more extreme than our acrophily strategy.

Our findings of acrophily are congruent with and can be explained by previous literature that examined how people evaluate political extremes. Previous research suggests that extremes tend to be perceived as more representative of the political normative view, more committed to their party, more authentic, and more coherent in their views, which seems to be attractive. We further tested some of these perceptions in study 1, reported in the Supplementary material, and provide some empirical support for these ideas. For example, we found that participants evaluated extreme profiles as more aligned with the mainstream view of their party supporters (strongest predictor of acrophily), more confident, interesting, and intelligent, and more likely to provide solid arguments in discussions. All of these seem to be contributing to acrophily.

The current project not only provides evidence for acrophily but is also the first to examine the association between acrophily and affective polarization. In study 1, we found that acrophily was associated with out-group animosity, measured by both reported feelings toward the opposite political party and one‚Äôs own party. In study 2, we analyzed the content of users‚Äô tweets and found that users‚Äô tendency for acrophily was associated with both the expression of negative emotions as well as the use of third-person language. Furthermore, it was particularly associated with the co-occurrence at an individual level of expressing negative emotions and using third-person language, providing further evidence for out-group animosity. These findings provide further evidence of the connection between group identity and preference and affective polarization, a connection that only recently has received empirical support.

Our findings have far-reaching implications regarding the way segregation and polarization occurs on social media. Assuming that users‚Äô tie-selection decisions are driven by acrophily, such decisions lead to a much faster and more extreme segregation compared to segregation driven by homophily. Furthermore, if people are disproportionally likely to see extreme users, they are more likely to be exposed to extreme views and eventually to conform to them. In line with this idea, our results suggest that the tendency for acrophily is associated with out-group animosity, suggesting that together with increasing segregation, acrophily is either contributing to or may be a result of increased intergroup hostility. Future research should examine the causal relation between these two variables.
","Political segregation is a pressing issue, particularly on social media platforms. Recent research suggests that one driver of segregation is political acrophily‚Äîpeople‚Äôs preference for others in their political group who have more extreme (rather than more moderate) political views. However, acrophily has been found in lab experiments, where people choose to interact with others based on little information. Furthermore, these studies have not examined whether acrophily is associated with animosity toward one‚Äôs political out-group. Using a combination of a survey experiment (N = 388) and an analysis of the retweet network on Twitter (3,898,327 unique ties), we find evidence for users‚Äô tendency for acrophily in the context of social media. We observe that this tendency is more pronounced among conservatives on Twitter and that acrophily is associated with higher levels of out-group animosity. These findings provide important in- and out-of-the-lab evidence for understanding acrophily on social media.

Whether or not attention to the rewards, or distraction from them, is the better strategy for sustaining self-control depends on how the rewards are represented cognitively. A focus on their arousing features makes self-control exceedingly difficult; a focus on their more abstract, informative features has the opposite effects. Moreover, the type of cognitive representation generated can overcome, and reverse, the effects of exposure to the rewards themselves.","To function effectively, individuals must voluntarily postpone immediate gratification and persist in goal-directed behavior for the sake of later outcomes.

Those 4-year-old children who delayed gratification longer in certain laboratory situations developed into more cognitively and socially competent adolescents, achieving higher scholastic performance and coping better with frustration and stress.

Psychological Bulletin, 129(3), 339‚Äì375. https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.339","Our review of the evidence indicates that there is consistent and relatively strong support for the general hypothesis that a specific set of social‚Äìcognitive motives are significantly related to political conservatism. Almost all of our specific hypotheses were corroborated. Effect sizes with absolute values of weighted mean rs ranging from .18 to .27 were obtained for variables of uncertainty avoidance; integrative complexity; needs for order, structure, and closure; and fear of threat in general. Stronger effect sizes were observed for dogmatism, intolerance of ambiguity, openness to experience, mortality salience, and system instability (with weighted mean rs ranging from .32 to .50). On the basis of this evidence, we conclude that a set of interrelated epistemic, existential, and ideological motives successfully predict the holding of politically conservative attitudes. As illustrated in Figure 1, how people respond to threatening environmental stimuli, such as fear and uncertainty, plays a significant role in the development and expression of political beliefs concerning resistance to change, inequality, and other core aspects of conservative ideology.

We have argued that several specific motives relating to the management of fear and uncertainty are associated with the ideology of political conservatism. Our analysis in terms of motivated social cognition helps both to integrate seemingly unrelated hypotheses derived from the literature on personality and individual differences and social psychology and to expand on these hypotheses to further understand the role of situational factors in the vicissitudes of conservatism. By reviewing the results from many different studies aggregated across various behavioral domains and contexts, we found that a moderate to strong relationship does exist between an interrelated set of epistemic, existential, and ideological motives and the expression of political conservatism. In concluding, we consider issues that are deserving of future empirical attention and summarize what we have learned by viewing political conservatism through a motivated social‚Äìcognitive lens.","Analyzing political conservatism as motivated social cognition integrates theories of personality (authoritarianism, dogmatism-intolerance of ambiguity), epistemic and existential needs (for closure, regulatory focus, terror management), and ideological rationalization (social dominance, system justification). A meta-analysis (88 samples, 12 countries, 22,818 cases) confirms that several psychological variables predict political conservatism: death anxiety (weighted mean r =.50); system instability (.47); dogmatism-intolerance of ambiguity (.34); openness to experience (‚àí.32); uncertainty tolerance (‚àí.27); needs for order, structure, and closure (.26); integrative complexity (‚àí.20); fear of threat and loss (.18); and self-esteem (‚àí.09).

Soc Just Res 20, 98‚Äì116 (2007). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11211-007-0034-z","To summarize, we have argued for three main points: (1) Human morality consists of more than what is covered by the traditional Kohlberg/Gilligan domains of justice and care. (2) Liberal morality rests primarily on these two foundations (fairness/reciprocity and harm/care), whereas conservative morality rests on five foundations, including ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity concerns as well. (3) Recognizing these latter foundations as moral (instead of amoral, immoral, or just plain stupid) can open a door in the wall that separates liberals and conservatives when discussing moral issues. Social justice researchers and activists have much to gain by acknowledging the moral nature of arguments related to ingroup, authority, and purity and much to lose if they do not. Even if they never come to value group cohesion, institutional integrity, or divinity as much as conservatives do, it is crucial to understand these concerns, especially when they conflict with the virtues of compassion, justice, and equality.

Jost et al. (2003) describe the core elements of conservatism as opposition to change and acceptance of inequality, associating it with traits like dogmatism, intolerance of ambiguity, high need for order, and low cognitive complexity. They suggest that conservatives believe what they do due to a specific pattern of epistemic and existential motives. However, looking at the full range of human societies, the typical society is built upon all five moral foundations. Modern liberalism, rather than conservatism, requires special explanation for its focus on harm/care and justice/fairness. Factors like free markets, social mobility, science, material wealth, and diversity likely contributed to this narrowing of the moral domain.

We agree with Jost et al. that conservatism can be understood as motivated social cognition, but we emphasize that many of these motives are moral. The same applies to liberals. Social justice researchers might benefit from stepping out of the good-versus-evil mindset common in academic discourse. Labeling opposing views as evil erects a moral wall that prevents understanding and respect. We end with an appeal to a great liberal value: tolerance. To make progress and stay true to their values, social justice advocates must understand, respect, and work with the moral concerns of those with whom they disagree.
","Researchers in moral psychology and social justice have agreed that morality is about matters of harm, rights, and justice. On this definition of morality, conservative opposition to social justice programs appears to be immoral, and has been explained as a product of various non-moral processes such as system justification or social dominance orientation. In this article, we argue that, from an anthropological perspective, the moral domain is usually much broader, encompassing many more aspects of social life and valuing institutions as much or more than individuals. We present theoretical and empirical reasons for believing that there are five psychological systems that provide the foundations for the world‚Äôs many moralities. The five foundations are psychological preparations for detecting and reacting emotionally to issues related to harm/care, fairness/reciprocity, ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity. Political liberals have moral intuitions primarily based upon the first two foundations, and therefore misunderstand the moral motivations of political conservatives, who generally rely upon all five foundations.","6",0,"6","Political",5,1
177,58,"Tetlock, P. E. (1986). A value pluralism model of ideological reasoning. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 50(4), 819‚Äì827. https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.50.4.819","The findings lend direct support to key process assumptions of the value pluralism model. People thought about policy issues in more integratively complex ways, and they were less confident in the correctness of the issue stands they took, to the extent that (a) the policy issue placed two values in conflict that people viewed as close to equal in importance and (b) people ranked both of the conflicting values highly on the Rokeach Value Survey. The study also supports the value pluralism model's contention that issue-specific value conflict is typically a much more reliable and powerful predictor of complexity of reasoning than general individual differences.
These trends, which emerged with varying strength on all six policy issues, have important implications for existing theories of cognitive style and decision-making. The data suggest, for instance, that the sharp distinction that some cognitive style theorists have drawn between the content and structure of thought processes is an artificial one (Schroder et al., 1967; Streufert & Streufert, 1978; Suedfeld, 1983). What people think (the basic values they hold and the types of problems they are trying to solve) may often constrain how they think (the complexity of their reasoning). Content and structure are closely intertwined, and efforts to analyze structure in isolation from content can produce highly misleading conclusions. Debates over the cross-issue or cross-situation generality of individual differences in complexity of thought need to be reformulated. It should be possible to find evidence for either specificity or generality depending on whether the issues sampled in a study activate similar conflicting values and depending on the correlations that exist among respondents' values (cf. Bowers, 1973, on the futility of the trait versus situation debate in general).
The data also suggest that the long-standing controversy over the relation between cognitive style and political ideology needs to be recast. Two schools of thought have dominated this debate. One position‚Äîthe ‚Äúrigidity-of-the-right‚Äù hypothesis‚Äîderives largely from the classic work on the authoritarian personality (Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson, & Sanford, 1950; Sanford, 1973). From this standpoint, a special affinity exists between rigid dichotomous styles of thinking and right-wing political ideology. A substantial body of research findings appears, moreover, to support this generalization (cf. McClosky, 1967; Stone, 1980; Tetlock et al., 1985; Wilson, 1973). The second position, the ideologue hypothesis, emerged in critical reaction to the apparent insensitivity of the rigidity-of-the-right hypothesis to ‚Äúauthoritarianism of the left.‚Äù True believers‚Äîwhether of the left or right‚Äîare held to be more dogmatic, more intolerant of ambiguity, and more prone to view issues in rigid dichotomous terms than are moderates who take less extreme positions (cf. Holsti, 1974; Shils, 1956).
Tetlock's (1984) study of British parliamentarians suggests that both the rigidity-of-the-right and ideologue hypotheses capture part of the truth. But the current results imply that reality is much more complicated than either traditional viewpoint would have predicted. Although some ideological groups tend on average to be more integratively complex than other groups, numerous exceptions to such generalizations should be expected. Different issues activate different patterns of conflict among basic values; patterns of conflict that different ideological groups will experience more or less intensely depending on their own distinctive value priorities. For some issues, the point of maximum value conflict may occur among left-of-center groups, for other issues, it may occur among right-of-center groups. Systematic study of such Ideology √ó Issue interactions should be a major goal of future laboratory and archival studies on this topic.
A third theoretical implication of the data also deserves note. The findings point to the need to place qualifications on models of choice processes which make sweeping claims concerning the inability or reluctance of people to think in complex trade-off terms. The cognitive miser characterization of the decision-maker is incomplete. Under conditions of high value conflict, people can be motivated to confront both pluses and minuses of policy proposals, and even to make explicit attempts to trade these pluses and minuses against each other in choosing between rival options. Viewed from this perspective, the current data add to the growing evidence supportive of contingency theories of decision making which emphasize the context-dependent nature of human information processing (Payne, 1982). We need to be sensitive to both individual difference and situational boundary conditions on broad generalizations about the nature of judgment and choice processes (cf. Tetlock, 1985a; Tetlock, in press).
Although the main-effect predictors of similarity-of-value-strength and average-value-importance yielded strong support for the value pluralism model, the hypothesized interactive effects of these two variables were less consistent. In part, this may have been due to the multicollinearity problem that often arises when cross-product terms are entered into multiple regressions. A purely statistical explanation is not, however, adequate here. The predictive power of the cross-product term varied across dependent variables. Significant cross-product effects emerged much more consistently for the conceptual integration variable (all six issues) than for the conceptual differentiation or confidence variables (on only one issue). The magnitude of the interaction effect was also substantially greater for the conceptual integration variable. It would appear that the presence of both components of value conflict‚Äîsimilarity of value strength and average importance of conflicting values‚Äîstimulates people to generate more integrative cognitions, but not more differentiated ones. This pattern of results is suggestive. Generating integrative cognitions (that provide guidelines for determining when one or another conflicting value should prevail) is an effort- and time-consuming task that many people may take on only when they feel it absolutely necessary to do so. One rule of thumb that people may use is to think in integratively complex ways only when values near the very top of one's value hierarchy prescribe opposite courses of action. The intensity of the value conflict thus activated may serve as a warning of the need to make conditional trade-off judgments of the form ‚ÄúLet value x prevail under these circumstances and value y under these circumstances.‚Äù
The cross-product predictor results are also suggestive in another regard. If people had responded to intense value conflict defensively (e.g., by bolstering a slightly preferred option or by avoiding thinking about the topic altogether) we would have observed a negative relation between the cross-product predictors and the conceptual differentiation and integration ratings. The relations observed, however, were all positive‚Äîin some cases, powerfully so. In the terminology of the Janis and Mann (1977) conflict model of decision making, people responded to value conflict by increased vigilance, by trying to balance the pluses and minuses of conflicting arguments and by trying to arrive at viable integrative solutions to the policy problems. Of course, these results do not demonstrate that people never respond defensively to value conflict. If respondents had been led to be pessimistic about the feasibility of identifying viable integrative solutions, or if they had been placed under severe time pressure or accountability constraints, a very different pattern of results might have emerged. A variety of personological and situational varibles may well moderate the relations between value conflict and decision-making styles.
Finally, a brief comment is in order on the value of adopting a multimethod approach to the study of political reasoning (see also Tetlock, 1983c). Archival studies of political elites yield useful descriptive information on the relations between ideological orientation, on the one hand, and styles of policy reasoning, on the other hand. Archival studies shed relatively little light, however, on the psychological processes underlying these relations. The current study attempts to fill this gap in our understanding of process issues. By directly measuring the value priorities of individual respondents, and by experimentally controlling the values brought into conflict through question selection, it was possible to achieve much stronger tests of the hypothesis that complex trade-off forms of reasoning are most likely to emerge in policy domains that activate important, and approximately equally important, conflicting values.","The value pluralism model asserts that people are likely to think about an issue domain in integratively complex ways to the degree that issue domain activates conflicting values that people perceive as (a) important and (b) approximately equally important. The present study tests the value pluralism model by exploring the relations between the value hierarchies people endorse (measured by the Rokeach Value Survey, Rokeach, 1973) and the policy preferences people express on issues designed to activate conflicts between different pairs of basic social-political values (e.g., the question of whether one is willing to pay higher taxes to assist the poor activates a conflict between concern for personal prosperity and social equality). Regression analyses revealed that (a) policy preferences could be best predicted from knowledge of which of the conflicting values respondents deemed more important and (b) the integrative complexity of people's reasoning about policy issues could be best predicted from knowledge of the similarity of the importance rankings of the conflicting values, the mean importance ranking of the two conflicting values, and the interaction of these two terms. The value pluralism model provides a flexible theoretical framework for predicting Ideology √ó Issue interactions in both the content and structure of policy reasoning.","4",0,"4","Political",4,1

Psychology of Men & Masculinities. Advance online publication. https://doi.org/10.1037/men0000474","In this investigation, we explored the interplay between Traditional Masculinity Ideology (TMI), authoritarian submission, and political attitudes among men in Russia, a country characterized by an authoritarian regime and gender inequality in politics. Our hypothesis posited that higher endorsement of TMI would correlate with greater authoritarian submission, which in turn would predict less support for transforming the political status quo.

Our findings confirmed this hypothesis: TMI was positively correlated with authoritarian submission, even after controlling for factors like age, education, and income. Authoritarian submission mediated the relationship between TMI and attitudes toward political protests and repression. Individuals with high authoritarian submission were less supportive of protest behaviors (e.g., online petitions, demonstrations) and more supportive of repressive actions against dissenters.

Some peculiarities emerged in our results. In Study 1, authoritarian submission was not linked to appeals to authority or donations, likely because respondents did not interpret these as protest behaviors. In Study 2, authoritarian submission explained more variance in negative attitudes toward peaceful protests than violent ones, potentially due to Russia's recent political events, such as the Wagner Group's march on Moscow, which blurred the lines between pro- and anti-authority actions.

Our research also highlighted the role of specific TMI domains. While TMI generally explained political attitudes, certain domains, like Avoidance of Femininity and Negativity toward Sexual Minorities, showed unique linkages to political views. This could be attributed to the centrality of these narratives in Russian propaganda, emphasizing traditional gender roles and heteronormativity.

In summary, our study contributes to the growing literature on masculinity and politics, demonstrating that TMI is a robust predictor of political attitudes, even in authoritarian contexts like Russia. Our findings suggest that TMI influences not only views on gender but also broader political ideologies, including support for authoritarian regimes and repression of opposition.","Limited research has explored the connection between traditional masculinity ideology (TMI) and political attitudes, focusing on adherence to political ideologies and approval of specific leaders aligning with traditional masculinity.

Encompassing men residing in Russia (N1 = 825, N2 = 614), our findings revealed that TMI is positively associated with attitudes toward repression against political opposition but negatively associated with attitudes toward political protests. However, these associations were mediated by authoritarian submission, signifying confidence in the imperative to obey political authorities. Notably, only the general TMI factor evinced indirect effects on political attitudes. We further discuss the underlying reasons and potential limitations of the obtained results.","2",0,"2","Political",3,0

British Journal of Social Psychology, 63(2), 544-571. https://doi.org/10.1111/bjso.12693","This research examined the role of positive emotionality in diversity statements and its impact on attitudes towards organizations. Study 1 analyzed diversity statements from 600 European organizations, revealing that while emotionality varied, it was not linked to gender diversity metrics. Study 2 tested whether existing emotionality levels in diversity statements evoked positive emotions or influenced attitudes but found no significant effects. Study 3 modified diversity statements to enhance emotionality, showing that high levels of positive emotionality triggered stronger positive emotions, which in turn predicted more favorable attitudes toward the organization.

These results support the idea that incorporating highly emotional words (e.g., wholeheartedly, passionate, love) in diversity statements can enhance organizational attractiveness, while low-emotionality words (e.g., fortunate, appreciate) had no significant effect. Contrary to expectations, experiences of social exclusion and minority group identities did not significantly moderate the emotionality-attitude link.

The study contributes to the broader literature on the social effects of emotions by showing how emotional cues in written texts shape attitudes. While prior research focused on verbal or visual expressions of emotions, this study highlights the importance of specific emotional words in organizational communication.

Limitations include the use of English-based emotionality measurement tools, the focus on positive-negative emotional valence rather than discrete emotions, and the inability to disentangle emotionality from positivity. Additionally, minority group identity analyses were exploratory, and further research is needed to examine emotionality effects across different diversity statement framings and cultural contexts.","To attract and retain a more diverse workforce, organizations often adopt diversity initiatives, expressed through diversity statements on their websites. While the explicit content of these statements influences attitudes towards organizations, the role of subtle cues like emotionality remains underexplored. In three pre-registered studies, we investigated the impact of positive emotional language in diversity statements on organizational perceptions.

Study 1 analyzed diversity statements from 600 European organizations and found that, although emotionality varied, organizations generally avoided highly emotional words. Study 2, involving 220 UK participants, assessed the influence of original diversity statements on readers' attitudes and revealed that existing emotionality levels did not significantly affect positive perceptions of the organizations. However, Study 3, with 815 UK participants, modified the diversity statements to include higher levels of positive emotional language. This adjustment triggered stronger positive emotions in readers and led to more favorable attitudes towards the organizations.

Overall, the findings suggest that incorporating highly emotional words‚Äîsuch as passionate, happy, and wholeheartedly‚Äîinto diversity statements can significantly enhance an organization‚Äôs appeal to potential employees.","3",0,"3","Political",3,1

Personality and Individual Differences, 235, 112970.","Our study investigated the relationship between secure national identification and national narcissism with various military attitudes, including specific military campaigns, general attitudes toward war, and support for violence against prisoners of war and civilians.

5.1. Attitudes Toward Military Action vs. Military Violence
We found that military attitudes form two distinct groups. The first group includes attitudes toward specific military campaigns and war as a means of international conflict resolution, which are influenced by political trust and system justification. The second group includes attitudes toward military violence against prisoners and civilians, which are more closely associated with individual psychological traits like moral disengagement and psychopathy.

5.2. National Identity and Military Attitudes
National narcissism was positively linked to all forms of military aggression, consistent with previous studies in Europe. However, its effect on attitudes toward the war in Ukraine disappeared when controlling for political loyalty, suggesting that support for this military campaign is driven more by government loyalty than national identity.

Secure national identification showed positive associations with support for the military operation in Ukraine and, to a lesser extent, war in general. These associations disappeared when controlling for political attitudes, indicating that secure national identification may reflect support for government decisions rather than inherent militarism. Importantly, secure national identification was negatively or not associated with support for violence against civilians and prisoners, likely influenced by the Russian national identity emphasizing peace and hospitality.

5.3. Limitations and Future Research
Our study has several limitations. First, we focused solely on military attitudes without considering peaceful conflict resolution. Second, the online nature of our sample may underrepresent older or pro-government individuals. Third, we used explicit measures of attitudes, though implicit attitudes might reveal different patterns. Fourth, we could not control for all potential predictors, such as right-wing authoritarianism or moral disengagement, and used slightly different measures of secure national identification across studies. Lastly, the study was conducted in an authoritarian context, limiting generalizability to democratic societies.

Future research should explore attitudes toward peaceful conflict resolution, compare explicit and implicit attitudes, and examine these dynamics across different political systems to better understand the interplay of national identity and military attitudes.
","National identity significantly influences attitudes and behavior, but researchers differentiate between secure national identification and national narcissism. This study examined how these forms of national identity relate to militaristic attitudes, including support for specific military campaigns, general attitudes toward war as a conflict resolution method, and acceptance of excessive military violence against prisoners of war and civilians.

Using a cross-sectional design across several online studies, Study 1 focused on attitudes toward Russian military activities in Ukraine, while Studies 2a and 2b examined four distinct forms of military attitudes. The findings revealed that secure national identification was positively associated with support for government-approved military actions in Ukraine and, to a lesser extent, general pro-war attitudes. In contrast, national narcissism was consistently linked to positive attitudes toward all forms of military violence.

These results are interpreted in the context of the content of Russian national identity and the broader social environment in modern Russia.

Stereotype accuracy: One of the largest relationships and most replicable effects in all of social psychology. In T. Nelson (Ed.), Handbook of prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination (2nd ed., pp. 31‚Äì 63). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum","Consequences of Accurate and Inaccurate Stereotypes
Although a vast body of literature has assessed the effects of social stereotypes (see Schneider, 2004 for a review), research has only just begun to address the specific consequences of holding accurate versus inaccurate stereotypes. Westfall et al. (2015) found, for example, that those who most greatly exaggerated partisan political differences‚Äîi.e., those who were most inaccurate‚Äîwere most likely to be actively engaged in political action (such as donating money or working for a campaign). They concluded that it seemed likely that those who perceived greater polarization feel more of a need to support and defend their political group from the (perceived) threat posed by the opposing political party. This raises the possibility that inaccurate stereotypes are at least one source of the gridlock that has plagued American national politics for some time‚Äîif it is primarily extremists who are involved in politics, and if they demonize the opposition‚Äôs views as so extreme as to be ‚Äúbeyond the pale‚Äù (e.g., Republicans who liken mainstream Democrats to communists, or Democrats who liken mainstream Republicans to fascists and religious zealots), there may be little interest or perceived ability to reach common ground for moving forward.

Another consequence of increasing stereotype accuracy may be to increase multicultural sensitivity. Although different proponents of multiculturalism have different rationales, themes typically emphasize understanding and respecting the beliefs, values, and practices of people from different groups and background than one‚Äôs own. Respecting others‚Äô values, beliefs, and practices makes sense primarily if one has a reasonably clear (accurate) sense of what those values, beliefs, and practices are. Or, put differently, part of multiculturalism can be viewed as a call for increasing stereotypes as knowledge relative to stereotype inaccuracy.

Limitations to this Review
Many aspects of stereotypes cannot be assessed for their accuracy (prescriptive stereotypes, stereotypes as attitudes), and were therefore not reviewed here. It is possible that biases and motivated distortions operate more strongly for beliefs with no objective anchor in reality. Similarly, because the social sciences have produced little clear, unambiguous understanding of the origins of group differences, it is currently not possible to assess the accuracy of people‚Äôs beliefs about the sources or explanations for group differences.

This review also did not address the role of stereotypes in person perception (see our chapter in the prior edition of this Handbook for a more detailed review; Jussim et al., 2009). Although the dominant view in social psychology was once that stereotype biases powerfully and pervasively distort person perception (e.g., Darley & Fazio, 1980; Fiske & Neuberg, 1990), multiple meta-analyses (see Jussim, 2012 for a review of those meta-analyses) show that stereotype biases in person perception tend to be quite small whereas reliance on individuating information is another one of the largest effects in social psychology. Considerable evidence has accumulated that people usually (though not always) apply their stereotypes in a largely rational manner, relying heavily on stereotypes in the absence of clear individuating information, but relying heavily on relevant individuating information when it is available (e.g., Baron, Albright, & Malloy, 1995; Crawford, Jussim, Madon, Cain, & Stevens, 2011; Locksley, Borgida, Brekke, & Hepburn, 1980; see reviews by Jussim, 2012; Jussim et al., 2009; Kunda & Thagard, 1996).

CONCLUSION
It ain‚Äôt what you don‚Äôt know that gets you into trouble.
It‚Äôs what you know for sure that just ain‚Äôt so.
‚Äî(Mark Twain)

For decades, researchers declared stereotypes to be inaccurate on the basis of little or no evidence. This claim was repeated so frequently that it was presumed to be true in the absence of evidence. Blanket, unqualified declarations of stereotype inaccuracy are unjustified. To be sure, evidence of stereotype inaccuracy clearly exists. But it exists amidst a body of literature that also includes abundant evidence of stereotype accuracy. In 2014, when this chapter was written, it is only possible to maintain blunt declarations of stereotype inaccuracy by cherry-picking studies demonstrating inaccuracy, systematically ignoring studies that demonstrate accuracy, and employing double standards that permit the derogation of accuracy studies that are at least as methodologically sound as inaccuracy studies.

Thus, our final recommendation is that researchers simply stop declaring stereotypes, in general, to be inaccurate (obviously, declaring any particular perceiver or perceiver group‚Äôs stereotypes to be inaccurate in a particular study may be completely justified). Instead, progress in the social psychology of intergroup relations will be elevated by scholarship that recognizes that stereotype (in)accuracy is an empirical question, and that degrees of (in)accuracy may vary across perceivers, perceiver groups, target groups, and target attributes. As that notion begins to take hold, it will open up a wealth of socially and theoretically important questions about the causes and consequences of stereotype accuracy and inaccuracy. We hope that more social scientists accept the challenge of trying to obtain empirical answers to those questions.","","5",0,"5","Apolitical",4,0

Perspectives on Psychological Science, 7(5), 496‚Äì503. https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691612448792","Like most scientists (Cardiff & Klein, 2005), social and personality psychologists are on average more liberal than the general population (Gallup, 2010). Yet we also find in two studies that their political ideology is more diverse than often assumed. On economics and foreign policy, a sizeable minority described themselves as moderate or conservative. Indeed, although only 6% described themselves as conservative ‚Äúoverall,‚Äù on economic and international affairs our sample already meets or exceeds the 10% ‚Äúquota‚Äù that Haidt (2011) suggested as a 10-year target for ideological diversity. Why, then, did Haidt have such difficulty finding more than a handful of conservative colleagues? The current results suggest one answer: Members of the conservative minority are reluctant to express their political beliefs publicly. Survey 2 shows why: Hostility toward and willingness to discriminate against conservatives is widespread. One in six respondents said that she or he would be somewhat (or more) inclined to discriminate against conservatives in inviting them for symposia or reviewing their work. One in four would discriminate in reviewing their grant applications. More than one in three would discriminate against them when making hiring decisions. Thus, willingness to discriminate is not limited to small decisions. In fact, it is strongest when it comes to the most important decisions, such as grant applications and hiring. This hostile climate offers a simple explanation of why conservatives hide their political opinions from colleagues. Given that all academics depend on the opinions of their colleagues‚Äîwho judge their papers, grants, and job applications‚Äîand given that such judgments are typically made by multiple reviewers (most of whom are liberal), this means that outspoken conservatives face a very serious problem. Hence, the more conservative respondents are, the more they hide their political opinions.
Limitations
One might argue that our discrimination questions overstate respondents‚Äô willingness to discriminate, because we asked only whether they would evaluate papers and grant applications that seemed to take a conservative perspective negatively, not how they would evaluate work with a liberal perspective. That is, perhaps any political perspective is seen as improper. Three things speak against this: First, there is a priori no reason to believe that objections to taking a political perspective per se should be correlated with ideology, yet we find a strong correlation. Liberals are much more negative toward work with a conservative perspective. Second, the paper and grant review questions correlate positively with the other two discrimination questions (rs > .45), which are not susceptible to this alternative explanation: Research should be neutral, but researchers need not be. Finally, it is easier to detect bias in material that opposes one‚Äôs beliefs than in material that supports it (Lord, Ross, & Lepper, 1979). Work that supports liberal politics may thus seem unremarkable, whereas work that supports conservatism is seen as improperly ideological. There is also the more subtle possibility that respondents interpreted ‚Äúconservative social psychologist‚Äù as describing a conservative activist bent on promoting a political agenda.2 We cannot rule this out entirely, but we should note that we also asked participants for comments (see below), and none advanced this interpretation.
We believe it even more plausible that our measures underestimate willingness to discriminate, because respondents were asked directly and because presumably there is a strong norm against discrimination among psychologists. Consistent with this, perceived willingness to discriminate was even stronger when people were asked about the behavior of their peers‚Äîan indirect measure that bypasses some social desirability concerns.
There is good reason to believe that the results of these two surveys can be generalized to social‚Äìpersonality psychology as a whole: On important demographics‚Äîage, gender, and nationality‚Äîour sample is quite similar to the entire SPSP membership. This close correspondence suggests that it is unlikely that nonresponders systematically differed from responders, although we cannot rule out this possibility entirely (we should note that this is the case for any survey research; see, e.g., Keeter, Kennedy, Dimock, Best, & Craighill, 2006). We also looked for‚Äîand were unable to find‚Äîdifferences between those who described their area as primarily or exclusively ‚Äúsocial psychology‚Äù and those who described it as primarily or exclusively ‚Äúpersonality psychology.‚Äù The findings described here thus seem to be equally descriptive of psychologists in both areas (although limited, of course, to those who are SPSP members).
What about other areas within psychology? Here we have little firm empirical evidence. Cardiff and Klein (2005) obtained the political party registrations of 4,563 California faculty and found that among all psychology faculty (N = 295), Democrats outnumbered Republicans at a ratio of 8:1. This might seem high, but in Survey 2, we found a liberal to conservative ratio of almost 14:1 (for ratings of ideology ‚Äúoverall‚Äù). Keeping in mind the inherent problems of comparing these two very different samples (and of assuming that ‚Äúliberal‚Äù and ‚Äúconservative‚Äù self-descriptions are reliable proxies for Democratic and Republican voter registration), this comparison suggests that social‚Äìpersonality psychologists might be even more liberal on average than psychologists overall.
Implications
Is it a problem that conservative political opinion is not tolerated? If one believes that conservatives are simply wrong, perhaps not. After all, geologists are not obliged to accept colleagues who believe the earth is flat. But political or moral beliefs often do not have a truth value. A belief that the earth is flat is factually false; a belief that abortion should be prohibited is not. Neither is a belief that cultural traditions should be respected or that economic inequality is acceptable. It may also be that many aspects of conservative thinking can serve as inspiration for interesting research questions that would otherwise be missed. Finally, as offensive as it may seem to many (liberal) social psychologists, believing that abortion is murder does not mean that one cannot do excellent research.
But what is perhaps the most important issue‚Äîan issue that we believe most psychologists, regardless of political background, will find troubling‚Äîis that conservatives are barred from discussion and are forced to keep their political opinion to themselves, coupled with a denial of the severity of this issue. We found this in our quantitative data, as described in this article. But perhaps even more telling is what we found in our qualitative data. At the end of our surveys, we gave room for comments. Many respondents wrote that they could not believe that anyone in the field would ever deliberately discriminate against conservatives. Yet at the same time we found clear examples of discrimination. One participant described how a colleague was denied tenure because of his political beliefs. Another wrote that if the department ‚Äúcould figure out who was a conservative they would be sure not to hire them.‚Äù Various participants described how colleagues silenced them during political discussions because they had voted Republican. One participant wrote that ‚Äúit causes me great stress to not be able to have an environment where open dialogue is acceptable. Although most colleagues talk about tolerance, and some are, there are a few vociferous voices that make for a closed environment.‚Äù Some respondents wrote that at times they felt reluctant to ask certain questions because these hinted at a conservative identity. But an environment that stimulates open discussion and where hypotheses may be raised regardless of their political implications can only benefit our field. Even those who fundamentally disagree with conservatism will agree that silencing political opponents will not convert them. By excluding those who disagree with (most of) us politically, we treat them unfairly, do ourselves a disservice, and ultimately damage the scientific credibility of our field.","A lack of political diversity in psychology is said to lead to a number of pernicious outcomes, including biased research and active discrimination against conservatives. We surveyed a large number (combined N = 800) of social and personality psychologists and discovered several interesting facts. First, although only 6% described themselves as conservative ‚Äúoverall,‚Äù there was more diversity of political opinion on economic issues and foreign policy. Second, respondents significantly underestimated the proportion of conservatives among their colleagues. Third, conservatives fear negative consequences of revealing their political beliefs to their colleagues. Finally, they are right to do so: In decisions ranging from paper reviews to hiring, many social and personality psychologists said that they would discriminate against openly conservative colleagues. The more liberal respondents were, the more they said they would discriminate.","4",0,"4","Political",5,0

Social Cognition, 38(5), 422-446. https://doi.org/10.1521/soco.2020.38.5.422","An emotion that people experience in one situation can influence their behavior in a later situation that is objectively unrelated to the conditions that gave rise to it. This generalization has been observed in a limited number of emotions, such as anger (Goldberg, Lerner, & Tetlock, 1999), fear (Lerner & Keltner, 2000) and jealousy (Wang & Griskevicius, 2014). Our conceptualization of the processes that underlie these effects assumes that the motivation to eliminate the negative feelings associated with a negative emotion activates a more general goal and the situation-specific plan-goal schemas that are associated with it. Therefore, if attributes of a later, unrelated situation exemplify features of one of these schemas, they can activate this schema and stimulate behavior in this situation independently of the conditions that initially gave rise to the emotion. Our application of this conceptualization to the incidental effects of embarrassment is particularly provocative in light of Goffman‚Äôs (1959) contention that embarrassment is situation-specific and is not experienced when people interact with individuals who are unaware of the embarrassment-eliciting incident. According to our conceptualization, however, feelings of embarrassment induce a general concern about being evaluated favorably by others, and this concern continues to be accessible in memory in later situations in which the concern is applicable. Because individuals are particularly motivated to make a favorable impression on physically attractive members of the opposite sex and on socially powerful persons, the activation of this self-presentation concern makes them apprehensive about how these persons might evaluate them and decreases their willingness to interact with such persons. This can occur even if (a) interaction occurs in a situation that is unrelated to that in which feelings of embarrassment were elicited, and (b) the persons with whom they anticipate interacting have no knowledge of the embarrassing incident. Four experiments provided support for this conceptualization and its applicability in quite different types of interaction situations. We showed that inducing feelings of embarrassment in one situation decreased the desire to interact with both a physically attractive opposite-sex peer (Experiments 1 and 2) and a socially powerful person (Experiment 3 and 4). Moreover, this effect was evident not only in judgments in a hypothetical situation but also in actual behavior (Experiment 2). Finally, it confirmed our assumption that self-presentation concerns elicited by feelings of embarrassment depend not only on characteristics of the person with whom individuals anticipate interacting but also on individual differences in the importance attached to creating a favorable impression on others (Experiment 4). AN ALTERNATIVE CONCEPTUALIZATION Our conceptualization of the effects we observed is similar in many respects to a theory of incidental emotion proposed by Raghunathan and colleagues (2006). Their theory, an extension of the conception of affect as information proposed by Schwarz and Clore (1996), assumes that an emotion, along with the conditions that give rise to it, continues to be experienced in a later situation and provides information about how to cope with it in this situation. As Goffman (1959) pointed out, however, feelings of embarrassment are transitory and are unlikely to be experienced in the presence of persons who have no knowledge of the embarrassment-eliciting event. Therefore, although we have no direct evidence that the embarrassment we induced in our studies did not exist at the time participants considered the interaction, this assumption seems likely to be true. In contrast, the conceptualization we proposed assumes that the effect of embarrassment on behavior in a later situation does not result from a desire to cope with the feelings of embarrassment per se. Rather, it results from a more general, self-presentation goal that, although activated by the embarrassment-eliciting situation, influences behavior in a later situation independently of the feelings that gave rise to this goal. This influence could potentially occur even if these feelings are no longer experienced. To this extent, our results are more compatible with the conceptualization we propose than that proposed by Raghunathan and colleagues (2006). Note that although embarrassed individuals avoid interacting with attractive opposite sex persons, they might still like them more than they like persons of average attractiveness. That is, the avoidance tendency that is activated by embarrassed individuals‚Äô concern over creating a bad impression might override the approach tendency that is elicited by the persons‚Äô physical attractiveness. Impression management research (Leary & Kowalski, 1990) suggests that people are motivated to create a favorable impression on highly attractive persons because they like these persons, but if they do not think they can accomplish this, they adopt a protective self-presentational strategy (e.g., avoidance) that minimizes the likelihood of being evaluated unfavorably. EMBARRASSMENT VERSUS SHAME AND GUILT The evidence that the effects of embarrassment do not generalize to self-conscious emotions such as shame and guilt is particularly noteworthy. Shame, guilt, and embarrassment are all responses to the perception that one has engaged in socially inappropriate behavior (Borg et al., 1988; Izard, 1977; Kaufman, 1989). Few previous studies have investigated the differences between them. In fact, some studies have implicitly equated shame and embarrassment and combined them into a single scale (Izard, 1977; Kaufman, 1989). However, our findings confirm Tangney and colleagues‚Äô (1996) conclusion that although shame and embarrassment are often positively correlated, they are distinct emotions that can have both different antecedents and different consequences and can be influenced independently by situational factors. Specifically, Experiment 1 showed that although embarrassed male participants were less willing to interact with an attractive woman than with a less attractive one, ashamed, guilty, or sad participants were more willing to do so. As we suggested earlier, shame results from a perceived deficiency in one‚Äôs core self, whereas embarrassment results from a perceived deficiency in the self one presents to others (Modigliani, 1968; Shott, 1979). Thus, embarrassment results from the anticipation of social disapproval while shame is related to self-disapproval (Miller, 1995). Therefore, ashamed people may have less concern about the impression they create in a particular situation than about bolstering their feelings of self-worth more generally. Similarly, guilt results from intentionally performing a behavior one considers to be immoral; it can be a private experience and does not require public exposure. Both shame and guilt can threaten one‚Äôs self-esteem. As Experiment 1 indicated, however, embarrassed participants‚Äô reactions are not a result of decreased self-esteem but rather are mediated by self-presentation concerns. In some cases, situations that cause embarrassment could also threaten self-esteem and consequently could influence feelings of shame or guilt as well. Be that as it may, the difference between the effects of embarrassment and the effects of shame and guilt on people‚Äôs social interaction tendencies has not previously been identified empirically. CULTURAL DIFFERENCES IN THE EFFECTS OF EMBARRASSMENT The evidence that the effect of embarrassment depends on individuals‚Äô self-construal is of more general interest. To reiterate, embarrassed people with an interdependent self-construal are likely to have strong self-presentation concerns and thus avoid interacting with persons they might otherwise want to impress. In contrast, people with independent self-construals are less likely to be concerned about others‚Äô reactions to them. Although participants‚Äô self-construals in the present research were experimentally induced, more general cultural differences exist in persons‚Äô disposition to think of themselves as independent or in relation to others. That is, people with interdependent self-construals are more common in Asian cultures than in Western cultures (Markus & Kitayama, 1991). Thus, Asians emphasize impression management more than Westerners do (Lalwani et al., 2006; Lalwani et al., 2009; Wan, 2013); however, little research has explored cultural differences in reactions to attractive opposite-sex and socially powerful others. To this extent, our research suggests a general difference in Westerners‚Äô and Asians‚Äô responses to embarrassing situations that has not been previously identified. Other individual differences in the effects of embarrassment might exist under the conditions we investigated. For example, the effects might depend in part on individuals‚Äô own physical attractiveness. Past research showed that physically attractive individuals typically have high social competence (Dion et al., 1972), and they are socially skilled in interacting with opposite sex others (Goldman & Lewis, 1977). To this extent, they may be relatively confident in interacting with physically attractive others and less concerned about others‚Äô reactions to them. This possibility may be a worthwhile consideration for further work in this area. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH Several restrictions on the generality of our findings are made salient by the preceding discussion. In most of our studies, embarrassment was induced by participants recalling a past experience and was not manipulated directly. Moreover, its effects were typically inferred from responses to imagined interaction situations rather than actual ones. An exception occurred in Experiment 2, in which participants directly experienced an embarrassing situation, and its effects on actual behavior were assessed. This study provides some assurance that our results do generalize to naturally occurring situations outside the laboratory. Nonetheless, further indications of this generalizability are worth considering. Two more theoretical questions are raised by our results. One question concerns the extent to which the effects of incidental embarrassment persist over time. In our studies, participants‚Äô interaction behavior was assessed only a short time after the feelings of embarrassment were activated. Although feelings of embarrassment are unlikely to persist for reasons discussed earlier, the self-presentation concerns stimulated by these feelings may be more enduring. Factors that influence the duration of these self-presentation concerns are worth examining. Second, the evidence that participants were more likely to approach physically attractive and socially powerful individuals when feelings of embarrassment had not been elicited suggests that dispositions to approach these individuals occur spontaneously but are overridden by conscious and deliberate avoidance tendencies when self-presentation concerns exist. If this is so, preventing them from engaging in this cognitive deliberation (e.g., putting them under cognitive load) might eliminate these avoidance tendencies leading spontaneous approach behavior to dominate. Although this possibility is speculative, it might be an avenue for future investigation.","People usually enjoy interacting with persons who are physically attractive or socially powerful. However, the embarrassment they happen to have experienced in an earlier, unrelated situation can sometimes inhibit them from doing so. Feelings of embarrassment increase individuals‚Äô concern about their ability to present themselves in a positive light and activate more general concepts associated with this concern. Therefore, once these concepts become accessible in memory, they can lead the individuals to avoid interacting with a person on whom they wish to make a good impression (for example, a physically attractive member of the opposite sex or a person who has social power over them). Moreover, this is true even though the person has no knowledge of the incident that had led to their embarrassment. These effects are particularly pronounced among individuals with an interdependent self-construal. The effects are unique to embarrassment and do not generalize to other self-conscious emotions.

In a recent survey by the American Psychological Association (see Welch, 2016), more than three-fourths of African Americans reported encountering at least some instances of discrimination on a day-to-day basis, and almost two in five African American males said that they had been mistreated by the police. Given these sobering statistics, it is essential that psychological science continue to elucidate the sources and consequences of acts of prejudice and discrimination, both subtle and overt. The study of microaggressions is a potentially fruitful step in this direction. The MRP has brought much-needed attention to relatively mild manifestations of prejudice that have far too often been overlooked. Moreover, the MRP has stimulated discussion regarding the potential dangers of statements and actions that have sometimes been dismissed as innocuous. In this respect, it would be an error to toss out the baby with the bathwater. Racial and cultural snubs, both intentional and unintentional, undeniably occur, and their potential impact on the mental health of minority group individuals merits further investigation. Hence, it would be unwise to call for a halt to the MRP, and that is not my intention.
At the same time, the MRP leaves a daunting number of critical scientific questions, both conceptual and methodological, unaddressed and unanswered. Furthermore, the MRP has been largely insulated from substantial bodies of well-replicated research in psychological science. As a program of research, the MRP appears to be in a relatively embryonic stage of development. Although several of its central hypotheses are plausible and worthy of further inquiry, they have yet to be subjected to adequate scientific scrutiny. In this regard, the MRP may be little different from other nascent psychological constructs that await refinement in light of additional scientific knowledge. Over time, many open concepts become more closed, as well as more theoretically elaborated, with the emergence of new data (Hempel, 1965; Meehl, 1989). Nevertheless, given the numerous unresolved questions surrounding the microaggression construct and its correlates, it behooves MRP scholars to be circumspect in advocating for the application of this fledgling concept to colleges, businesses, and other real-world settings.
The MRP also highlights the hazards of questionable interpretive practices (Jussim, Crawford, Anglin, Stevens, & Duarte, 2016). In contrast to questionable research practices, which bear on how psychological scientists analyze data, questionable interpretive practices bear on how psychological scientists evaluate data. Questionable interpretive practices can contribute to an undue neglect of ‚Äúmasked interpretations‚Äù (Jussim et al., 2016), namely, interpretations of findings that are plausible yet not considered by authors. Although much of the microaggression literature lends itself to multiple interpretations, MRP proponents have typically homed in on only those that support the views that (a) purported microaggressions reflect implicitly prejudicial statements and actions and (b) these statements and actions contribute to psychological maladjustment. MRP researchers have not sufficiently considered other interpretations, such as the possibility that certain microaggression items reflect innocuous statements or actions that do not stem from implicit racial biases, or that other microaggression items reflect high-base-rate events (e.g., being passed over by a taxi driver for a person of a different race) that do not stem from such biases. Nor have MRP investigators accorded sufficient attention to the possibility that the statistical association between reported microaggressions and mental health derives in part from the contaminating influence of NE, especially enduring individual differences in perceived victimization and hostile attribution bias.
Taking stock of the scientific status of the MRP
As noted earlier, the MRP appears to hinge on five key premises; these premises are worth revisiting of light of the research I have reviewed.
1. Microaggressions are operationalized with sufficient clarity and consensus to afford rigorous scientific investigation.
The support for this assertion is at best murky. The boundaries of the microaggression concept are at present so amorphous that an enormous array of behaviors on the part of majority group individuals, many of them innocuous, can be subsumed under the expansive microaggression umbrella. As a consequence, the false-positive rates of current microaggression lists may be substantial and remain unknown. Moreover, some microaggressions identified in the MRP literature are largely contradictory. Because there are no interrater reliability data on whether recipients of microaggressions agree on which individuals are engaging in subtle prejudice, the extent to which microaggressions reflect consensually agreed-on acts of prejudice is also unknown.
In sum, the presumed microaggressions that are widely accepted in the MRP literature (e.g., Sue et al., 2007) may be an undetermined mix of (a) intentional statements reflecting actual prejudice, (b) well-intentioned but implicitly prejudicial statements, (c) culturally insensitive faux pas that do not reflect implicit prejudice, and (d) entirely innocuous statements that are misinterpreted by recipients. The MRP must make more concerted efforts to parse this potential heterogeneity using multimethod approaches and multivariate analyses.
2. Microaggressions are interpreted negatively by most or all minority group members.
There is no systematic research support for this hypothesis. Furthermore, it is prima facie implausible that this is the case for all microaggressions, as this assertion flies in the face of large bodies of research in social cognition and cognitive-behavioral therapy. It also runs against the grain of contemporary transactional models of coping, which posit that reactions to potential stressors are influenced by individual differences. Specifically, the MRP largely overlooks the possibility‚Äîindeed, the probability‚Äîthat individual differences color recipients‚Äô interpretations of, and reactions to, microaggressions.
3. Microaggressions reflect implicitly prejudicial and implicitly aggressive motives.
There is no research support for this assertion. Specifically, there is no evidence that microaggressions are correlated with indicators of either prejudice or aggression in deliverers.
4. Microaggressions can be validly assessed using only respondents‚Äô subjective reports.
The mono-source bias that has characterized the MRP has hampered the field‚Äôs evaluation of the robustness of the MRP and its generalizability across multiple respondents. The MRP‚Äôs virtually exclusive reliance on self-reported microaggressions (but see Su√°rez-Orozco et al., 2015) also makes it impossible to exclude the possibility that individual differences in the subjective appraisal of microaggressions in part reflect stable individual differences in personality.
5. Microaggressions exert an adverse impact on the mental health of recipients.
There is minimal research evidence for this assertion, and the unqualified causal claims of MRP proponents are insufficiently justified. Furthermore, the MRP‚Äôs nearly wholesale neglect of personality traits, especially NE (but see Ong et al., 2013, for a partial exception), renders it difficult or impossible to rule out the possibility that some of the association between microaggressions and mental health outcomes is attributable to the contaminating influence of personality. The marked ambiguity of microaggressions leaves considerable room for interpretations of and reactions to them to be shaped by recipients‚Äô personality traits. These same traits may also boost individuals‚Äô risk for adverse mental health outcomes. As it presently stands, the MRP demonstrates only that certain individuals report consistently experiencing a high frequency of prejudicial comments and actions, and that these same individuals also consistently report psychological distress.
Returning to the scientific criteria delineated toward the beginning of the article, the MRP would appear to raise more questions than answers. Specifically, my review indicates that (a) the microaggression concept remains in need of clarification with respect to its content and boundaries; (b) the interrater agreement of microaggression measures across self and observers is unknown; (c) microaggression measures display consistent criterion-related validity with indices of mental health, although the extent to which their convergent correlations are attributable to NE and other personality traits is unknown; (d) the incremental validity of microaggression measures above and beyond measures of overt prejudice requires considerably more investigation; and (e) the MRP has yielded a number of consistently replicated findings regarding the relation between microaggressions and psychological adjustment, but these replications have not been extended to independent observers and have instead been limited to self-reported predictors and criteria. In fairness, the evidentiary weaknesses of the MRP are more matters of absence of evidence than of evidence of absence. Few of the core premises of the MRP have been subjected to adequate research scrutiny, and it is possible that some or even all of them will be corroborated in future research. To advance as a scientific endeavor, however, the MRP will need to address a large number of scientific questions that it has heretofore accorded insufficient attention.
In Table 1, I offer 18 summary recommendations that should place the MRP on firmer scientific footing and subject the core tenets of this research program to ‚Äúrisker‚Äù scientific tests (Meehl, 1978). All of these suggestions flow from the research literature already discussed. Cutting across most or all of them is one overarching recommendation: The MRP must establish considerably stronger ties to well-established domains of basic and applied psychological science. The intellectual insularity of the MRP has impeded its ability to shield its research from embedded sociopolitical biases and to address rival explanations for findings. To redress this shortcoming, MRP advocates will need to forge linkages with researchers holding offsetting sociopolitical biases and whose expertise derives from different intellectual traditions within psychological science. In this respect, the methodological and conceptual limitations of the MRP may impart broader lessons for research in other politically contentious domains in social and personality psychology (see Jussim et al., 2016). The MRP, like many other contentious scientific domains, may benefit from adversarial collaborations (Koole & Lakens, 2012) between advocates and skeptics. Such collaborations could enhance the quality of MRP research by boosting the odds that investigations are planned, conducted, and analyzed by researchers with differing viewpoints. Nevertheless, forging this approach to MRP research may be easier said than done given the dearth of sociopolitical diversity in a number of domains of psychology, including social psychology (Duarte et al., 2015). Looking to the future, MRP proponents and skeptics alike will benefit from journal and conference forums that encourage respectful exchanges of divergent perspectives on microaggressions.
The list of recommendations outlined here should also help to allay concerns that critics of the MRP are inadvertently ‚Äúplaying into the hands‚Äù of those who condone prejudice and discrimination. My goal is not to discourage research on microaggressions but to elevate the quality of the MRP and to ensure that the strength of scientific assertions regarding microaggressions is roughly proportional to the strength of the scientific evidence.
Blaming the victim?
Some prominent MRP proponents have responded to attacks on the microaggression concept on the grounds that critics are guilty of ‚Äúblaming the victim‚Äù (e.g., Sue, Capodilupo, Nadal, & Torino, 2008, p. 278). The heart of the blaming-the-victim thesis appears to be that calling into question the objective reality of some microaggressions denies the reality of racism, the devastating impact of racism on victims, or both. Framed in different terms, the concern seems to be that MRP critics have committed the fundamental attribution error (Ross, 1977) or even the ultimate attribution error (Pettigrew, 1979), erroneously attributing the negative reactions of minority individuals to personal defects of minority individuals or of minority races as a whole rather than to their understandable reactions to prejudice.
In evaluating the blaming-the-victim argument, one must distinguish blame from cause (Felson, 1991). To propose that certain purported microaggressions may be misinterpreted by their recipients is no way places moral blame or responsibility on them; it merely advances a testable scientific hypothesis. Furthermore, the blaming-the-victim argument carries little force in the case of the present review, because my critique of the MRP gainsays neither the existence nor the potency of overt racism, nor the undeniable truth that racism is at times manifested in insidious ways. Nor do I contend that individual differences in NE account for all of the association between microaggressions and mental health, only that they may account for part of it.
In addition, the assertion that critics are blaming the victim risks becoming a rhetorical ploy rather than a substantive scientific rebuttal. Ultimately, the onus of proof falls squarely on advocates of the MRP to demonstrate that their central assertions can bear the hefty evidentiary weight assigned to them. Moreover, these advocates must be careful not to commit fundamental attribution errors of their own, such as reflexively attributing well-meaning attempts on the part of majority individuals to learn more about foreign individuals‚Äô background and culture of origin (‚ÄúWhere were you born?‚Äù) to implicit prejudice. One serious risk of the MRP as presently conceptualized is that it frequently attributes malign intent to individuals without sufficient scientific justification.
What‚Äôs in a name redux
My literature review also raises serious questions concerning the use of the word ‚Äúmicroaggression.‚Äù Over 45 years ago, Pierce (1970) coined this term to refer to subtle insults and indignities that can collectively create a hostile atmosphere for minority individuals. There can be little doubt that some microaggressions, especially when repeated, can foment such an atmosphere. Nevertheless, the term ‚Äúmicroaggression‚Äù conflates the outcome of a behavior with its intent. The very idea of an unintentional act of aggression is almost certainly oxymoronic and misleading, as aggressive actions are virtually by definition intended to produce harm (e.g., Geen, 2001).
In addition, as we have discovered, there is no research evidence that microaggressions correlate with indices of either aggression or prejudice in deliverers. Further muddying the waters, some microaggressions, especially many microassaults, are blatantly prejudicial and anything but subtle. There is no reason why the prefix ‚Äúmicro‚Äù should be affixed to such actions. Doing so blurs the potentially important conceptual distinction between overt and subtle prejudice, risks trivializing severe acts of prejudice, and renders it difficult to exclude the possibility that some of the association between global scores on microaggression measures and adverse outcomes is due to overt prejudice.
With these considerations in mind, a name change appears to be overdue. I propose that ‚Äúmicroaggression‚Äù be replaced by a term that is free of its problematic conceptual and empirical baggage, especially its unsubstantiated presumption of hostile content. I further propose that microassaults and other overt forms of prejudice and discrimination be dropped from the microaggression concept. Specifically, I provisionally suggest that microaggressions instead be termed ‚Äúinadvertent racial slights‚Äù to (a) highlight the unintentional nature of most or virtually all microaggressions, especially microinsults and microinvalidations (see Sue et al., 2007), and (b) shed the unmerited implication that microaggressions are aggressive in nature and perhaps intent, a presumption that may engender unjustified hostile attributions in recipients. From there, research can proceed to identify and better understand the sources, correlates, and potential consequences of inadvertent racial slights from a multi-informant perspective, incorporating self-reports and reports of multiple observers.
Pragmatic and policy implications
Although the focus of this review has been on the scientific evidence for the MRP, it is worth briefly considering the potential hazards posed by the premature importation of the MRP into real-world contexts, such as the worlds of higher education and business. These issues bear on the potential consequences (Messick, 1995) of microaggression instruments, and the MRP more broadly, for real-world settings. As observed earlier, microaggression training programs, as well as standardized lists of microaggressions, have been widely adopted on college and university campuses across the United States (Barbash, 2015).
To be certain, these applications of the MRP are well intentioned, and it is certainly possible that they assist in prejudice reduction. Such programs also serve a potentially useful communicative function. By informing students and members of organizations that prejudice and discrimination, even when subtle, are unacceptable, they may play a constructive role in shaping societal norms concerning the need to demonstrate respect for minority individuals. These programs may also help to assure minority individuals and other victims of racial and cultural oppression that their frequently neglected voices have been heard.
These potential benefits notwithstanding, it is concerning that these training programs have yet to be subjected to controlled trials. The histories of clinical and educational psychology remind us that well-meaning but insufficiently tested interventions can sometimes be harmful (Wilson, 2011). This ‚Äúlaw of unintended consequences‚Äù certainly holds for psychotherapy. For example, Scared Straight interventions for adolescents at risk for delinquency and critical incident stress (crisis) debriefing programs for people exposed to potentially traumatizing events have been associated with negative effect sizes in some randomized controlled trials (Lilienfeld, 2007, in press), although the reasons for these apparent iatrogenic effects are actively debated.
In the case of microaggression training programs, there are similarly at least some grounds for concern. On the one hand, although the corpus of systematic research on diversity training programs is preliminary (Paluck & Green, 2009), meta-analytic evidence suggests that these programs may exert small to medium beneficial effects on prejudice (Kalinoski et al., 2013). On the other hand, attempts to reduce prejudice come with risks. At least in laboratory settings, antiprejudice campaigns that exert strong pressure on people to be nonprejudiced appear to backfire, yielding heightened levels of prejudice (Legault, Gutsell, & Inzlicht, 2011). These results, if replicable and generalizable to real-world settings, may bear implications for microaggression training programs, some of which urge recipients of microaggressions to inform deliverers that their comments are offensive (Neff, 2015), and microaggression websites, some of which urge professors to interrupt and correct students who have engaged in microaggressions toward classmates (University of Denver Center for Multicultural Excellence, 2016). If performed in a heavy-handed fashion, microaggression programs may risk engendering reactance (Brehm, 1966) in some individuals, boosting the risk of backfire effects in real-world settings.
More speculatively, a heightened attention to microaggressions may sensitize minority individuals to subtle signs of potential prejudice, leading them to become hypervigilant to trivial potential slights. Such hypersensitivity might engender confirmation bias (Nickerson, 1998), predisposing minority individuals to perceive subtle signals of prejudice in their absence. In turn, these individuals may become more likely to experience negative psychological reactions following minor perceived provocations; they may also become more likely to perceive themselves as emotionally fragile. More broadly, institutional efforts to encourage individuals to attend to and identify purported microaggressions could lower the threshold for what is considered hostile or offensive (see Haslam, 2015, for a discussion of ‚Äúconcept creep‚Äù), thereby generating high rates of false-positive identifications of innocuous behaviors as microaggressions. If so, microaggression training programs could run the risk of exacerbating racial tensions on campuses and other organizations (Haidt & Jussim, 2016), although this conjecture awaits research scrutiny.
This potential self-reinforcing process accords broadly with Gergen‚Äôs (1973) social constructivist view of social psychology (but see Schlenker, 1974, for a critique), in which people‚Äôs awareness of the fruits of psychological research can affect their behavior, both for better and for worse. This possibility also dovetails with Hacking‚Äôs (1995a) model of ‚Äúlooping effects,‚Äù in which our ways of classifying human behaviors in turn influence these behaviors themselves, as well as with various versions of labeling theory, which imply that pejorative names attached to ambiguous behaviors can create self-fulfilling prophecies (Link & Phelan, 2013; but see Gove, 1979, for an alternative perspective). For example, according to Hacking, once the concept of dissociative identity disorder (DID; formerly called multiple personality disorder) took root in popular culture, it began to alter how certain people viewed themselves: Rather than perceive themselves as merely moody, unpredictable, or confused, some of them began to conceptualize themselves as harboring multiple indwelling selves and to interpret their previously inexplicable thoughts, feelings, and actions in light of this newfound schema. Furthermore, the DID concept spawned a ‚Äúsemantic contagion‚Äù (Hacking, 1995b, p. 238) in which many individuals now possessed a novel vocabulary for describing and understanding themselves. Once this terminology became entrenched in the minds of laypersons, some of them began to perceive the world and themselves differently. The MRP could be fueling a comparable semantic contagion, in which statements and actions that were previously regarded as innocuous are now widely interpreted as baleful.
This sensitization hypothesis is not without precedent. Some authors have posited that the enhanced risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among some trauma-exposed clients who have received crisis debriefing stems from this intervention‚Äôs prescription of the PTSD signs and symptoms that clients are likely to experience in the wake of trauma (Bootzin & Bailey, 2005). After receiving this information, clients may become more open to suggestion, in turn developing some of the very PTSD features, such as sleep difficulties, hyperarousal, and hypervigilance, discussed during the intervention (Devilly, Gist, & Cotton, 2006). In one randomized controlled trial, investigators provided participants who had experienced trauma in the context of a serious physical injury or assault with a self-help pamphlet that described modal psychological reactions to the trauma; control participants received no information. Outcome data across several time points revealed nonsignificant trends for worse PTSD and depression outcomes in the pamphlet condition. In the case of microaggression training, MRP proponents should conduct controlled studies to determine whether workshop participants who receive information regarding the expected psychological sequelae of microaggressions later experience adverse psychological side effects in everyday life.
Based on the literature reviewed here, it seems more than prudent to call for a moratorium on microaggression training, the widespread distribution of microaggression lists on college campuses, and other practical implementations of the MRP (e.g., the insertion of microaggression questions on student course evaluations), at least until the MRP can take heed of many or most of the research recommendations listed here (see Table 1). Not only is the MRP still in a premature state of scientific development, but there is insufficient justification for concluding that the potential benefits of microaggression training programs outweigh their potential risks, including a substantial increase in the number of false-positive identifications of statements as microaggressions. To be clear, this proposed moratorium does not extend to the MRP itself, which should continue without interruption, albeit in substantially modified form.
Finally, the MRP risks inflicting further damage to the already tarnished image of psychology in the public eye. One likely reason for the less than stellar impression of psychology as a science among many laypersons has been our field‚Äôs troubling propensity to advance premature assertions in the absence of adequate evidence (Benjamin, 1986; Lilienfeld, 2012). Indeed, the MRP has already triggered something of a counterreaction in many quarters, with numerous authors in the public sphere parodying publicized microaggression lists (e.g., World Snews, 2015), and others decrying them as psychobabble or worse (e.g., Hausam, 2015; Rosen, 2014).
As in all domains of psychological science, humility should be the watchword (McFall, 1997; see also Ioannidis, 2016). I encourage microaggression researchers to continue their scholarly inquiries while substantially tempering their assertions, especially those concerning (a) the causal association between microaggressions and adverse mental health and (b) the presumed effectiveness of microaggression intervention efforts. The MRP has generated a plethora of theoretically and socially significant questions that merit thoughtful examination in coming decades. But it is not close to being ready for widespread real-world application.","The microaggression concept has recently galvanized public discussion and spread to numerous college campuses and businesses. I argue that the microaggression research program (MRP) rests on five core premises, namely, that microaggressions (1) are operationalized with sufficient clarity and consensus to afford rigorous scientific investigation; (2) are interpreted negatively by most or all minority group members; (3) reflect implicitly prejudicial and implicitly aggressive motives; (4) can be validly assessed using only respondents‚Äô subjective reports; and (5) exert an adverse impact on recipients‚Äô mental health. A review of the literature reveals negligible support for all five suppositions. More broadly, the MRP has been marked by an absence of connectivity to key domains of psychological science, including psychometrics, social cognition, cognitive-behavioral therapy, behavior genetics, and personality, health, and industrial-organizational psychology. Although the MRP has been fruitful in drawing the field‚Äôs attention to subtle forms of prejudice, it is far too underdeveloped on the conceptual and methodological fronts to warrant real-world application. I conclude with 18 suggestions for advancing the scientific status of the MRP, recommend abandonment of the term ‚Äúmicroaggression,‚Äù and call for a moratorium on microaggression training programs and publicly distributed microaggression lists pending research to address the MRP‚Äôs scientific limitations.","5",1,"5","Political",6,1
186,60,"Luhmann, M., Fassbender, I., Alcock, M., & Haehner, P. (2021). A dimensional taxonomy of perceived characteristics of major life events. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 121(3), 633‚Äì668. https://doi.org/10.1037/pspp0000291","MLEs differ in their impact on psychological outcomes, with some having positive effects, others negative effects, some transient, others lasting. In this article, we proposed a dimensional taxonomy of event characteristics that allows researchers to distinguish MLEs systematically and to investigate which characteristics are relevant to predict the direction, strength, and duration of the effect of an MLE on psychological outcomes. Our taxonomy comprises nine distinct characteristics of MLEs that can be measured with the ECQ. Together, these perceived event characteristics could explain individual differences in retrospective and longitudinal changes in SWB over and above person characteristics such as personality and demographics, indicating that considering perceived event characteristics may improve the prediction of people‚Äôs reaction and adaptation to MLEs. In this final section, we discuss the structure and content of the ECQ, the utility of perceived event characteristics as predictors of changes in psychological outcomes, the relationship between event characteristics and situation characteristics, and limitations and directions for future research. Structure and Content of the ECQ Of the nine characteristics, five refer to the event itself (valence, challenge, predictability, external control, extraordinariness) and four refer to the perceived consequences of the event (impact, emotional significance, change in world views, change in social status). As discussed in the situation literature, characteristics of a situation should be assessed separately from the consequences of a situation (e.g., Rauthmann, 2015). Applied to the ECQ, this means that the five event-focused characteristics provide a conceptually cleaner description of the MLE than the four consequence-focused characteristics. How did the consequence-focused characteristics end up in the ECQ, and should we keep them? The inclusion of consequence-focused event characteristics is a direct effect of partly basing our item development process on taxonomies of event characteristics that had been discussed in the existing literature. Most previous taxonomies included at least one dimension referring to adjustment and change or to emotional significance and stress associated with the event (see Table 1), indicating that these types of event characteristics were deemed of theoretical and/or empirical importance in previous work to explain long-term psychological outcomes. Consistent with this view, those ECQ dimensions that most robustly explained individual differences in both retrospective and longitudinal SWB trajectories (beyond valence) were consequence-focused event characteristics (impact and social status change). Hence, consequence-focused event characteristics might be particularly relevant to predict long-term changes in psychological outcomes after MLEs, whereas event-focused characteristics might be more relevant to explain short-term changes in these outcomes immediately after the MLE. Thus, including both consequence-focused and event-focused characteristics might improve the predictive utility of the ECQ. However, the inclusion of consequence-focused characteristics also introduces an important conceptual problem. We know from the situation literature that evaluating a situation based on its consequences is problematic because it introduces circularity (consequences corollary; Rauthmann, 2015): The direct consequences of an MLE (e.g., impact, social status change) are used to predict its long-term psychological consequences (e.g., changes in SWB). The circularity problem is particularly salient in studies where perceived event characteristics and psychological outcomes are rated at the same point in time by the same rater. A partial solution is to separate these ratings in time: for example, by assessing perceived event characteristics early after the MLE and psychological consequences repeatedly later on, as we did in Study 5. In addition, future studies should obtain ratings of perceived event characteristics and psychological outcomes from multiple sources. For example, informant ratings could be used for the event characteristics (Rauthmann et al., 2015) and/or for the psychological outcome. Future research therefore needs to determine whether the ECQ can be used by informants (who may or may not know the person having experienced the event) who rate events that occurred to other people (who may be real or hypothetical).","Major life events (MLEs) are studied in many different areas in psychology such as personality development, clinical psychology, or posttraumatic growth. In all of these areas, a common finding is that MLEs differ in their effects on psychological outcomes. However, a framework that allows a systematic examination of these differences is still absent. This article presents a systematic literature review and 4 empirical studies (Ns between 226 and 449, total N = 1,477) in which we developed and evaluated a dimensional taxonomy of 9 perceived characteristics of MLEs: valence, impact, predictability, challenge, emotional significance, change in worldviews, social status changes, external control, and extraordinariness. These event characteristics can be measured reliably with the Event Characteristics Questionnaire (ECQ). Perceived event characteristics predicted individual differences in changes in subjective well-being in both retrospective and longitudinal data after MLEs over and above established predictors of subjective well-being such as personality and demographic characteristics. A comparison between the ECQ and established taxonomies of situation characteristics such as the DIAMONDS (Rauthmann et al., 2014) showed high conceptual and empirical convergence between some ECQ subscales (e.g., valence, challenge) with characteristics of situations, whereas other ECQ subscales (e.g., social status changes, external control) were conceptually and empirically distinct from situation characteristics. In sum, including measures of perceived event characteristics in studies on MLEs may enhance our understanding of why MLEs differ in the direction, strength, and duration of their effects on psychological outcomes.","4",1,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,0
187,60,"Bleidorn, W., Schilling, T., & Hopwood, C. J. (2025). High Openness and Low Conscientiousness Predict Green Party Preferences and Voting. Social Psychological and Personality Science, 16(1), 93-104.","Effective proenvironmental measures toward a climate neutral economy necessitate structural changes that require broad support by the public (Hoffmann et al., 2022). Endorsing climate change policy and voting for a Green party that invests in economic, social, and political measures to support the environment has the potential for wide-reaching consequences (Schumacher, 2014). A better understanding of the psychological predictors of proenvironmental policy support is important to identify the factors that contribute to the transformation toward a greener economy and more sustainable society (Bleidorn et al., 2019, 2021; Hornsey et al., 2016). Here, we examined the role of Big Five personality traits in predicting the endorsement of and voting for the Green party in a nationally representative sample of Germans.
Consistent with theory and previous research on green partisanship, people who preferred the Green party over other mainstream parties were more likely to be women, younger, more educated, and more concerned about the environment (Aguilar-Luz√≥n et al., 2020; Bakker et al., 2015). Moreover, people who favored the Green party were also higher in openness and lower in conscientiousness, supporting theoretical arguments that people who are curious, open-minded, and intellectually interested are more likely to cast a green vote, whereas those who are obedient to rules, deliberate about choices, and more cautious in their decision-making are less likely to endorse Green party policies (Schoen & Schumann, 2007).
Notably, those who preferred the Green party in 2019 scored higher in conscientiousness and agreeableness and lower in openness compared to those who preferred the Greens in 2005, indicating that the personality profile of Green party voters has become more normative over the past two decades (Gebauer et al., 2014). In other words, the personality profile of the average Green party voter in 2019 is less extreme and more similar to the personality profiles of those who vote for centrist mainstream parties (see Figure 1). This finding is consistent with our prediction that the Green party‚Äôs transformation from a fringe movement to a mainstream party that wins elections is reflected in the personality profile of their votership.
We further found evidence for the incremental validity of personality traits in predicting green partisanship and voting. Specifically, controlling for demographics and environmental concerns, a one-unit increase in openness was associated with a 1% to 3% increase in the probability to prefer the Green party over other mainstream parties, whereas one-unit increases in conscientiousness, extraversion, and neuroticism were associated with a 1% to 4% decrease in the likelihood to endorse the Greens. This suggests that, although demographics and proenvironmental attitudes are key predictors of Green party endorsement, other aspects of personality are also relevant. For example, open people may not only hold proenvironmental attitudes but may also be open to thinking differently about political issues and changing their behavior in a more proenvironmental way. Overall, the full model explained up to 19% of the variance in people‚Äôs preference for the Green party, a substantial proportion given the known influence of several other circumstantial and contextual factors, including election campaigns, environmental changes, or spousal preferences (Caprara et al., 2006; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Schmitt-Beck et al., 2006).
Extending previous research on personality and political partisanship, we further found that personality traits predicted Green party switching across two federal elections. Again, controlling for demographic differences and environmental concerns, higher levels of openness and lower levels of extraversion significantly increased the likelihood to switch to a Green party vote. These effects are particularly interesting, given that there were no effects of the Big Five on the likelihood to switch from a Green party to different mainstream party vote nor were there any trait effects on switching party votes in general, highlighting the unique role of openness for the endorsement of green politics.
In contrast to theory and some research, however, we found no links between agreeableness and Green party preferences, voting, or vote switching in this sample. This finding was somewhat surprising, given that agreeableness is considered an important driver of proenvironmental attitudes and moral behavior more generally (Hopwood et al., 2021, 2024; Smillie et al., 2019; Soutter et al., 2020). A possible reason for this finding might have to do with the agreeableness measure used in the GSOEP, which emphasizes politeness over compassion content. These two defining aspects of agreeableness‚Äîcompassion and politeness‚Äîhave been theorized to have distinctive and dissociable links with proenvironmental behavior (Hopwood et al., 2022, 2023; Smillie et al., 2019). While compassionate people should be more likely to respond to green policy changes to protect our planet, polite people should be more responsive to policies that emphasize norm adherence and etiquette. The lack of compassionate content in the current Big Five measure may thus at least partly explain the null effects of agreeableness across analyses.
In summary, there is strong evidence for the incremental validity of personality traits, and especially openness, in predicting green partisanship and Green party voting. These findings are consistent with theory and research on the personality predictors of proenvironmental attitudes and behavior (Soutter et al., 2020). Together, they add to our growing understanding of the psychological factors that predict the endorsement of and actions toward proenvironmental change. Knowledge about the specific personality traits that predict the support of proenvironmental policy can be used to target certain populations, identify psychological obstacles that work against desired policy changes, and aid in developing effective campaigns that are tuned to the personality profiles of those that may be otherwise less likely to endorse proenvironmental policies. For example, if higher levels of conscientiousness reduce the likelihood to endorse proenvironmental policy changes, effective campaigns may focus on communicating changes in a way that emphasizes the establishment of norms and long-term strategies rather than radical transformations.
The present findings are also consistent with the literature on personality and political partisanship (e.g., Caprara et al., 2006). According to these works, personality traits are thought to guide people‚Äôs perceptions of political messages and their reactions to political leaders and campaigns. People who are high in openness and low in conscientiousness should thus be more attracted to Green party leaders and campaigns because they reflect and speak to these traits in terms of their programs, rhetoric, and images (Caprara et al., 2007). In other words, people appear to be indeed more likely to affiliate with a party that matches their personality, attitudes, and beliefs (Bakker et al., 2015; Bleidorn et al., 2016).
This study had several limitations. First, we examined the links between personality traits and green partisanship in data from one particular country. Our results are consistent with studies on other proenvironmental behaviors that relied on samples from, for example, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, or the United States (Hopwood et al., 2022; Soutter et al., 2020). However, patterns of both personality and political partisanship are highly contextualized, leaving it open as to whether these results generalize to other parts of the world with different political systems and party structures.
Second, the Big Five were assessed with short self-report measure with modest reliability and somewhat narrow content validity. Particularly, the relatively narrow focus of the agreeableness scale might have limited our ability to detect associations with green partisanship and voting behavior in this study.
Third, participants did not report their motives for endorsing a particular political party. Even though the German Green party considers environmental protection as the cornerstone of their politics, they also stand for other social justice issues (Schumacher, 2014). In addition to capturing individual‚Äôs willingness to support proenvironmental policy, our measure of political preference and voting may thus assess a broader inclination to endorse a Green party ideology beyond proenvironmental politics.","A substantial rise of vote shares of Green parties across European countries suggests an increasing support of environmental issues. A critical question for researchers and policymakers alike is, who endorses Green parties? Here, we examined the Big Five personality predictors of green partisanship, voting behavior, and party switching in a nationally representative sample of more than 27,000 Germans collected over a period of 16 years. Consistent with previous research, high openness and low conscientiousness emerged as the strongest personality predictors of green partisanship and voting behavior. Critically, high openness also predicted the likelihood to switch to a Green party vote across two federal elections. These effects held when controlling for demographics and environmental concerns, suggesting that the association between personality and support for Greens reflects more than social norms or attitudes about the environment. We close with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.","2",0,"2","Political",4,0

Emotion, 8(5), 662‚Äì667. https://doi.org/10.1037/a0013497","The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of daily weather changes on people‚Äôs mood. It was expected that individual differences in sensitivity to weather changes exist. The results of the current study showed no significant main effects of daily weather on positive affect. This result is consistent with findings by Keller et al. (2005) and Watson (2000), who also did not find effects of weather on overall mood valence. Going against commonly held conceptions (Watson, 2000), it is interesting to note that none of the six weather parameters had any significant main effects on positive mood. Accordingly, the idea that pleasant weather increases people‚Äôs positive mood in general is not supported by the findings of this study, although the finding of significant between-person variance suggests that such a link may still exist for some individuals (while simultaneously a reverse effect holds for others). Significant main effects of temperature, wind power, and sunlight on negative affect were found. The difference between the multivariate and univariate results showed that it was very informative to include different weather variables to identify the unique effect of each variable. The multivariate analysis showed unique effects of temperature, wind power, and sunlight, whereas the effects of temperature and sunlight were not visible in the univariate analyses because of confounds. Because univariate analyses do not control for other variables, positive and negative effects might cancel each other out. Sunlight was found to have a significant main effect on tiredness and mediated the effect of precipitation and air pressure on tiredness. Vitamin D3, which is produced in skin exposed to the hormone of sunlight, has been found to change serotonin levels in the brain, which could account for changes in mood (Lansdowne & Provost, 1998). Therefore, lower levels of vitamin D3 could be responsible for increases in negative affect and tiredness. As indicated by the relatively small regression weights (|.071|), weather fluctuations accounted for very little variance in people‚Äôs day-to-day mood. This result may be unexpected given the existence of commonly held conceptions that weather exerts a strong influence on mood (Watson, 2000), though it replicates findings by Watson (2000) and Keller et al. (2005), who also failed to report main effects. A number of factors may explain the discrepancy between empirical results and widely held beliefs (see also Watson, 2000). For example, it may be that these beliefs are a reflection of our historical (and possibly culturally transmitted) past, when people were much more dependent on weather-related phenomena (e.g., for shelter and food). It may also be that the discrepancy is because of a small number of extreme cases (e.g., individuals with SAD) who indeed report a strong association between weather and mood. Such cases may leave a very vivid impression on others, but the existence of significant between-person variance against the background of a null effect in the general population suggests that these extreme cases are offset by individuals with strikingly different weather dependencies (e.g., people who become sadder during summers instead of winters). The random effects analyses indicated that the effects of weather on positive affect, negative affect, and tiredness varied significantly across individuals. This was especially true for the effect of photoperiod. Even though the within-subject range of this variable (M = 0.83, SD = 0.73) was vastly reduced when compared to the range of the amount of hours with unobstructed sunlight (M = 7.56, SD = 4.64), the random slope variance between persons was between 9 (positive affect) and 23 (tiredness) times greater in the former when compared to the latter. On average, the random effect for photoperiod was no less than 21 times greater than the average random effect of the other five weather variables, indicating that individual differences in reactions to changes in photoperiod are much more extreme than reactions to day-to-day weather fluctuations. This means that whereas some individuals may react to the shortening of daylight time with a relatively strong darkening of their mood, the emotions of other individuals may actually improve equally strongly as a result of this seasonal change. The former individuals may be the ones who fall prey to SAD during the dark season, though more research is needed to substantiate this conclusion. Inclusion of the Five Factor Model personality traits, gender and age, did not reveal more moderation effects of the person-level variables than expected by chance. In other words, people seem to differ in the effects of weather on mood in a way that cannot be explained by the Five Factor Model personality traits, age, or gender. This might suggest that weather sensitivity is an individual difference variable by itself. Research on diurnal types (e.g., Jackson & Gerard, 1996) and seasonality (Reid, Towell, & Golding, 2000) also found individual differences that were independent to other personality traits. The findings of the present study suggest that people can also differ in weather sensitivity, independent from other personality traits. The current study also investigated the moderating effect of season on the association between weather and mood in an attempt to replicate the finding by Keller et al. (2005) that weather fluctuations have an especially strong effect in spring. Consistent with this, we found that wind power had a more negative effect on positive mood during spring and summer. This might be because of the fact that people spend more of their leisure time outside during these periods, so experiencing strong winds represents more of a hassle, though this conclusion is highly speculative and needs to be backed up by future research. Strengths. Usually, causal effects can only be identified in experimental designs. However, weather is an external variable that cannot be influenced by individuals‚Äô mood or any other third variable. Although our naturalistic design did not allow us to establish causality in the strict (experimental) sense, we believe that our findings are highly consistent with a causal model that flows from weather to mood (although we acknowledge that our results remain silent regarding the processes that mediate associations between weather and mood, such as physiological processes or daily activities). Furthermore, the data collection for the current study ran over an 18-month period, spanning all seasons, which provided a robust examination of the association between weather and mood and the moderating effect of season. Finally, the Web-based data collection ensured access to a large population, which resulted in a large and heterogeneous sample from all across Germany. Limitations. Response to the questionnaire was based on voluntary participation of the study, which likely resulted in selection bias (e.g., unequal gender distribution). Furthermore, the relation between daily weather and mood were found in a moderate maritime/continental climate and might not generalize to other climate types. In addition, we failed to assess the time that participants spent outside, which may have emerged as an important moderator of the effect of weather on mood (Keller et al., 2005). A final limitation is that we relied on self-reported mood that may be biased by implicit theories regarding the association between weather and mood. This might especially be the case given that the framing of the study (focusing on the determinants of well-being) may have primed some subjects to reflect about the types of external factors affecting their mood. Nevertheless, we think this concern is somewhat assuaged by a number of factors. For one thing, our study was not advertised as being about the link between weather and mood, mostly assessed unrelated variables (e.g., social interaction quantity and quality), and included a personalized feedback that should have encouraged accurate responding. Most importantly, however, our results, if anything, go against popular stereotypes about the link between weather and mood. For example, we did not find any weather effects on positive mood, whereas most people assume that sunlight induces positive emotions (Watson, 2000). Against this background, some of the null results of the current study are all the more remarkable.","The present study examines the effects of six weather parameters (temperature, wind power, sunlight, precipitation, air pressure, and photoperiod) on mood (positive affect, negative affect, and tiredness). Data were gathered from an online diary study (N = 1,233), linked to weather station data, and analyzed by means of multilevel analysis. Multivariate and univariate analyses enabled distinction between unique and shared effects. The results revealed main effects of temperature, wind power, and sunlight on negative affect. Sunlight had a main effect on tiredness and mediated the effects of precipitation and air pressure on tiredness. In terms of explained variance, however, the average effect of weather on mood was only small, though significant random variation was found across individuals, especially regarding the effect of photoperiod. However, these individual differences in weather sensitivity could not be explained by the Five Factor Model personality traits, gender, or age.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,1
189,60,"Lucas, R. E., Diener, E., & Suh, E. (1996). Discriminant validity of well-being measures. Journal of personality and social psychology, 71(3), 616.","The present studies allow us to draw a number of important conclusions regarding the discriminant validity of well-being constructs. Not only did we analyze multiple multitrait-multimethod matrices to allow replication of discriminant validity evidence, but we used different methods in each analysis. In addition to advancing knowledge of the convergence between a variety of methods of measurement, this methodology strengthens evidence of discriminant validity and allows researchers to examine the particular methods by which a construct can be measured and be discriminated from other similar constructs. The results show that life satisfaction was successful in meeting D. T. Campbell and Fiske's (1959) criteria for discriminant validity from both the affective components of subjective well-being and the more cognitive traits self-esteem and optimism. Using self-report data measured across 4 weeks or 2 years or with alternative scales, we found that life satisfaction never failed to meet the first or second criterion. Furthermore, when we used the particularly rigorous test of comparisons based on informant-report data (in which convergent validity coefficients could be expected to be lower), in two separate studies life satisfaction failed to meet the first criterion only 4 times in 32 comparisons with positive affect, negative affect, optimism, and self-esteem. These are the first rigorous analyses to show that the construct of life satisfaction and the measures available to assess it can be discriminated from the affective components of subjective well-being and from the conceptually similar constructs optimism and self-esteem. The present studies also replicate past research that demonstrated that positive affect and negative affect are not simply opposite poles on the same continuum. Instead, they are clearly discriminable (with no failures of the first or second criterion using self-report data and only two failures of the second criterion using informant-report data) and in many cases appear to be only slightly correlated. Finally, the present studies add to the literature regarding the separability of optimism from negative affect and the importance of the two-factor structure of scales such as the LOT. In a pattern similar to that found for life satisfaction, optimism succeeded in meeting D. T. Campbell and Fiske's (1959) first two criteria in the self-report longitudinal data spanning 4 weeks and 2 years. In addition, it met the first criterion in informant reports from Studies 1 and 2. However, in Study 3, convergent correlations between the LOT and the Hopelessness scale did not exceed heterotrait-monomethod correlations between optimism and positive affect and between optimism and negative affect. In light of the ability of the LOT to be discriminable in Studies 1 and 2, in which both informant reports and self-reports were used, this failure may be regarded not as a failure of the discriminability of optimism from affect, but as a failure of the Hopelessness Scale to measure the same construct as the LOT. This explanation accounts for the lack of discriminability exhibited by optimism in past research in which only one multitrait-multimethod matrix was used and the Hopelessness Scale was used as an alternate measure of optimism (Smith, Pope, Rhodewalt, & Poulton, 1989). Only through the use of multiple multitrait-multimethod matrices that include a variety of methods of measurement can researchers determine whether a construct's failure to meet D. T. Campbell and Fiske's criteria is due to a lack of discriminant validity of the construct or to nonequivalence of different measures purported to measure it. The pattern of results presented here suggest that the latter is the case. Similarly, at first glance, the numerous failures of self-esteem to discriminate from other constructs suggest that this construct is not robust and not discriminable from other similar constructs. Closer examination of the results, however, reveals that self-esteem's failure to discriminate often occurred when informant-report measures of self-esteem were used. When self-report measures (whether longitudinal or alternate forms) were used, self-esteem was as successful as the other constructs in meeting D. T. Campbell and Fiske's (1959) criteria for discriminant validity. These analyses suggest that just as the Hopelessness Scale may not be an appropriate measure of the global optimism that Scheier and Carver (1985) assessed with the LOT, informant reports may not be an appropriate method of assessing self-esteem. Instead, they may reflect a global perception of positive cognitions. The present studies indicate that conceptualizing the LOT as a two-factor instrument with separate subscales for optimism and pessimism reduces the degree to which the instrument meets psychometric criteria such as the desire for discriminant validity from similar constructs. Dividing the LOT into two subscales does not produce a more appropriate pattern in which optimism relates to positive affect and pessimism relates to negative affect. Instead, it demonstrates that the ability of optimism and pessimism to be discriminable from themselves or from both positive and negative affect is reduced. In all three studies, optimism as measured by the entire LOT, the Hopelessness Scale, and the subscales of optimism and pessimism correlated as highly with positive affect as with negative affect. Because positive and negative affect are theoretically independent and empirically separable (and only slightly correlated, according to the present studies) high correlations with both positive affect and negative affect indicate that optimism is not synonymous with either one. Instead, it is, as Carver et al. (1993) have suggested, a global, multifaceted construct that is highly correlated (but separable) from other measures of well-being, including negative and positive affect. Examining the pattern of correlations in each of these studies provides important information regarding the discriminant validity of life satisfaction, positive affect, negative affect, optimism, and self-esteem and the validity of different measures of these constructs. This investigation also suggests a possible problem with the use of informant reports of subjective internal feelings. Although informant reports show some ability to discriminate between the constructs examined, this discrimination is markedly less than in analyses using only self-reports. For example, although, as stated earlier, negative affect is theoretically and empirically independent from positive affect (Diener & Emmons, 1984; Watson & Tellegen, 1985), in the informant monomethod triangle in Studies 1 and 2, the correlations between positive and negative affect were -.23 and -.43, respectively, compared with ‚Äî.14 in each of the other triangles in Study 1 and ‚Äî.32 and ‚Äî.36 in Study 2. These elevated correlations suggest that informants do not have the ability to discriminate successfully between somewhat similar concepts. Instead, they have a tendency to rate the person similarly on all positive traits or all negative traits. As Funder (1989) has pointed out, however, informant judgments are impressive not because they are perfect, but because ""in the face of enormous difficulties . . . they manage to have any accuracy at all"" (p. 212). There is a growing body of evidence that seems to illustrate the discriminant validity of subjective well-being measures from other global, cognitive constructs, such as self-esteem. However, to be certain of the robustness of this finding, researchers must examine the relation in a number of ways. One possible way is to examine the factors that influence both life satisfaction and other constructs‚Äîto examine each construct's nomological net. For example, Diener (1984) reported that in most studies of life satisfaction Blacks report lower levels of life satisfaction than do Whites. Tashakkori (1993), however, reported that many studies of self-esteem report higher self-esteem in African Americans than in Whites. Similarly, Diener and Fujita (1995) found that personal resources correlated much more highly with judgments of life satisfaction than with affect. Researchers investigating the relationship between optimism and neuroticism and negative affectivity argue that whereas optimism scores can predict future objective symptoms, negative affect can predict only symptom reports‚Äîa more subjective construct. If actual symptoms (as assessed by a physician) are examined, neuroticism and negative affect cannot predict them. Although these studies alone cannot illustrate the discriminant validity of these constructs, the pattern of relations can. Establishing that each construct has a unique nomological net of relations can support the claim of discriminant validity. By examining the network of relations, future researchers can also overcome one of the limitations of the present study‚Äîthe homogeneity of the sample used. Because only university students were recruited as participants, it is difficult to say whether the discriminant validity of these scales will generalize to their use in all populations. There are two reasons to remain optimistic about the constructs' discriminant validity. First, Study 2 measured students before and after a period of potentially intense change‚Äîgraduation from college and entrance into the job market. Some participants had found a job; others had not. Some had married; others had stayed single. If life satisfaction before these changes is correlated with life satisfaction after these changes more highly than life satisfaction is correlated with negative affect (both measured at Time 1), it not only is strong evidence for the discriminant validity, but also suggests that the discriminant validity may generalize to populations other than students. Second, the homogeneity of the sample should only hurt the ability of the constructs to exhibit evidence of discriminant validity. A restricted range reduces correlations between two measurements of the same construct, making it harder for convergent validity coefficients to exceed correlations among different constructs. This is not to say that the present research can completely answer the question of whether the constructs are discriminable in all cultures, but it is an encouraging first step. Future research must examine these constructs in other contexts and in other cultures to discover the generalizability of the evidence for discriminant validity found here.","The convergent and discriminant validities of well-being concepts were examined using multitrait‚Äìmultimethod matrix analyses (D. T. Campbell & D. W. Fiske, 1959) on 3 sets of data. In Study 1, participants completed measures of life satisfaction, positive affect, negative affect, self-esteem, and optimism on 2 occasions 4 weeks apart and also obtained 3 informant ratings. In Study 2, participants completed each of the 5 measures on 2 occasions 2 years apart and collected informant reports at Time 2. In Study 3, participants completed 2 different scales for each of the 5 constructs. Analyses showed that (a) life satisfaction is discriminable from positive and negative affect, (b) positive affect is discriminable from negative affect, (c) life satisfaction is discriminable from optimism and self-esteem, and (d) optimism is separable from trait measures of negative affect.","4",1,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,1

Nature over nurture: temperament, personality, and life span development. Journal of personality and social psychology, 78(1), 173.","The intent of the whole preceding argument was to demonstrate that if by temperament we mean biologically based psychological tendencies with intrinsic paths of development, then standard personality inventories assess temperament, and traits such as aesthetic sensitivity, achievement striving, and modesty are as much temperaments as are activity level and behavioral inhibition. From this perspective it is perhaps not surprising that when Angleitner and Ostendorf (1994) factored adult temperament measures (A. H. Buss & Plomin, 1975; Strelau, Angleitner, Bantelmann, & Ruch, 1990) along with other markers they found the familiar structure of the five-factor model.
But if the individual differences identified by temperament researchers and personality trait psychologists are much the same, the goals and methods of these two research traditions are not. Researchers within the temperament tradition often emphasize basic processes and mechanisms. Ahadi and Rothbart (1994), for example, have examined psychological systems such as Approach and Effortful Control, and Strelau and colleagues (Strelau et al., 1990) have developed a set of constructs based on hypothesized Pavlovian properties of the central nervous system. In contrast, trait psychologists more often focus on outcomes and other correlates of traits. For example, Barrick and Mount (1991) showed that Conscientiousness is associated with superior job performance. By identifying personality traits with temperaments, researchers may begin to integrate these different emphases on causes and effects and come to a better understanding of both the origins and the expressions of basic tendencies (Costa & McCrae, in press).
The Structure and Stability of Individual Differences
It cannot be assumed that the adult structure of temperament will appear in analyses of temperament variables in children, but there is evidence that something similar to the five factors can be found in adult ratings of school children (Digman & Shmelyov, 1996; Kohnstamm, Halverson, Mervielde, & Havill, 1998) and in self-reports from children as young as 5 years old (Measelle & John, 1997). Ahadi and Rothbart (1994) have offered conceptual analyses that link child temperament constructs to adult personality factors: Approach to Extraversion, Anxiety to Neuroticism, and Effortful Control to Conscientiousness and Agreeableness. Classic efforts at understanding infant temperament (Thomas, Chess, & Birch, 1968) were not informed by the five-factor model; if investigators looked for these factors, they might find them even in neonates, just as they have been found in nonhuman animals (King & Figueredo, 1997).
Even if identical factors were found in infants and adults, it would not imply that infant temperament is a good predictor of adult personality. Reviews of the longitudinal literature have reported that temperament variables in fact show limited stability across relatively short intervals, especially among infants (e.g., Lemery, Goldsmith, Klinnert, & Mrazek, 1999), and very modest prediction of adult traits (Wachs, 1994). Block (1993), for example, examined retest correlations for ego undercontrol and ego resiliency at age 3 and age 23 in boys and girls; only one of these four correlations reached significance (although all were positive). In a recent review of the longitudinal attachment literature, Fraley (1998) reported an average correlation of .19 between attachment at age 1 and age 19. Kagan and Zentner (1996) found only modest associations between characteristics of early childhood and adult psychopathology.
Even modest associations can be meaningful if the outcomes are socially significant. Caspi and colleagues (Caspi, Elder, & Herbener, 1990) have shown that childhood personality traits (including shyness and ill-temperedness) can predict important life outcomes such as delayed marriage and downward mobility. Undercontrol at age 3 predicts health-risk behaviors in young adults through the mediation of personality traits in adolescence (Caspi et al., 1997).
With shorter intervals and older children, stronger associations are found. For example, ego control showed a retest correlation of .70 between age 3 and age 4, and .67 between age 14 and age 23 (Block, 1993). Siegler and colleagues (Siegler et al., 1990) estimated that half of the variance in personality dimensions is stable from late adolescence to middle adulthood, and Helson and Moane (1987) reported greater stability between age 27 and age 43 (a 16-year interval) than between age 21 and age 27 (a 6-year interval). When adults initially over age 30 are studied, uncorrected retest coefficients near .70 are not uncommon over 30-year periods (Costa & McCrae, 1992b).
One very general principle of life span personality development thus appears to be that the stability of individual differences over a fixed time interval increases steadily from infancy up to at least age 30. Environmentalists might assume that this phenomenon is attributable to the accumulation of life experiences: Any single new experience should affect more change when it occurs in the context of the limited experience of early life than when it competes with a lifetime of other experiences.
In contrast, FFT suggests another answer: Endogenous dispositions develop over time in ways that redistribute rank orderings. The functioning of genes, after all, is not fixed at birth; they switch on and off across the life span and contribute to individual patterns of aging. The brain itself continues to grow and develop until at least the mid-20s (Pujol, Vendrell, Junqu√©, Mart√≠-Vilalta, & Capdevila, 1993), so it is hardly surprising that personality traits would also change in this period.
Developmental Trends for Five Factors
At the aggregate level, it is possible to describe general developmental trends for the five factors (and the specific traits that define them; see McCrae et al., 1999). From age 18 to age 30 there are declines in Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Openness to Experience, and increases in Agreeableness and Conscientiousness; after age 30 the same trends are found, although the rate of change seems to decrease.
In this article we presented some of the first data tracing the five factors backward from age 18, with German, British, Czech, and Turkish samples. For the most part, high-school-age boys and girls appeared to continue the same trends: They were even higher in Neuroticism and Extraversion and lower in Agreeableness and Conscientiousness than were college-age students. No clear trend could be discerned for Openness to Experience, as lower instead of higher scores were found in the German and British samples.
The present data do support the use of instruments like the NEO-FFI in younger adolescents, and it would be a relatively simple matter to conduct cross-sectional studies on representative samples of this age group. Research with even younger samples is possible, but would require new instruments. Measelle and John (1997), for example, used a puppet interview to assess personality in young children and reported increases in Conscientiousness between ages 5 and 7. Calibrating puppet interviews and NEO-FFIs would be difficult, so it is likely that developmental trends will have to be pieced together from studies of overlapping segments of childhood.
What could account for these developmental trends? Evolutionary arguments might be offered. High levels of Extraversion and Openness to Experience might be useful in finding a mate, whereas higher Agreeableness and Conscientiousness might be more important for raising a family. Comparative studies of personality development in other primates (King et al., 1998) with different patterns of mating and child rearing might be used to test such evolutionary hypotheses.
The Development of Characteristic Adaptations
Finally, it is worth recalling that FFT postulates developments on two separate tracks: Basic tendencies follow a pattern of intrinsic maturation, whereas characteristic adaptations respond to the opportunities and incentives of the social environment. To the extent that the theory is correct, psychologists, educators, and parents will have relatively little impact on the long-term development of personality traits, but they can have an influence on characteristic adaptations (cf. Harkness & Lilienfeld, 1997). Traits can be channeled even if they cannot be changed. What kinds of habits, skills, beliefs, and social networks are optimal for shy or ill-tempered children? These are likely to be the most productive questions for those concerned about shaping human development.","Temperaments are often regarded as biologically based psychological tendencies with intrinsic paths of development. It is argued that this definition applies to the personality traits of the five-factor model. Evidence for the endogenous nature of traits is summarized from studies of behavior genetics, parent‚Äìchild relations, personality structure, animal personality, and the longitudinal stability of individual differences. New evidence for intrinsic maturation is offered from analyses of NEO Five-Factor Inventory scores for men and women age 14 and over in German, British, Spanish, Czech, and Turkish samples (N = 5,085). These data support strong conceptual links to child temperament despite modest empirical associations. The intrinsic maturation of personality is complemented by the culturally conditioned development of characteristic adaptations that express personality; interventions in human development are best addressed to these.","5",0,"5","Political",5,0

Does nostalgia serve as a more socially desirable way of expressing underlying racist and sexist attitudes? Or does nostalgia foster and reinforce these attitudes? We are necessarily limited in our ability to make causal claims using cross-sectional data. We suspect, however, that nostalgic appeals activate racial and sexist attitudes in individuals who fondly remember the past and who would like to return to what they perceive as a simpler time. This romanticized past was less diverse and less equitable, but, at least for dominant social groups, those times are remembered as simpler, safer, and more economically secure. Future research should experimentally explore whether and how nostalgia and nostalgic appeals affect racist and sexist beliefs.","Nostalgia plays an increasingly central and polarizing role in American politics, as the Republican Party has become the primary proprietor of nostalgic rhetoric.

Whereas only two articles on PsycInfo mentioned microaggressions before 2007, over 1000 articles mentioning microaggressions have since been written. Yet despite its growing popularity, many remain skeptical about the impact that microaggressions can have (e.g., Haidt, 2017; Lilienfeld, 2017; Lukianoff & Haidt, 2015). Therefore, the purpose of this meta-analysis was to examine the relations between microaggression experiences and psychological well-being, physical health, job outcomes, and positive and negative coping. Potential moderators of these effects were also examined. 

Our results suggest that microaggressions are generally detrimental to individuals. Specifically, experiences of microaggressions predicted decreased psychological well-being, physical health, job outcomes, and negative coping. Interestingly, microaggression also predicted positive coping. It is possible that both forms of coping are beneficial for combating the effects of microaggressions. Furthermore, the resource loss associated with microaggressions is not sufficient to inhibit the use of positive coping techniques. More longitudinal research examining the effects of microaggressions is necessary, however, to see if this relationship changes over time.

It was possible that strength of the impact of microaggressions was upwardly biased because nonsignificant results are less likely to be published (e.g., Koren et al., 1990; Mahoney, 1977). However, publication status did not moderate any of the relationships except for the relationship with positive coping. Thus, the use of positive coping techniques in response to microaggressions may be less frequent than published studies would have one believe.

The year in which a study was conducted could also be an important consideration, given that changes in societal attitudes could impact the public acceptance of and response to microaggressions. However, year of publication did not moderate any of the observed relationships, demonstrating that microaggressions are just as detrimental today as they were when researchers began studying this phenomenon.

Results examining the effect of type of microaggression on outcomes were mixed. We thought that the relationships between microaggressions and outcomes would differ depending on the type of microaggression being examined because not all identities are equally stigmatized. Indeed, racial microaggressions were more strongly related to positive coping and negative job outcomes than gender microaggressions. Additionally, supporting theories of intersectionality (King, 1988), intersectional microaggressions predicted more negative coping and worse psychological well-being than all nonintersectional microaggressions. They also predicted worse physical health outcomes than gender-based microaggressions. Thus, as others (e.g., Else-Quest & Hyde, 2016) have suggested, members of multiple stigmatized groups often experience more harm from discriminatory experiences.

The results also showed that the population used in the sample did not matter. Much of the research on microaggressions has been done on college students on university campuses. Because college students differ in many ways from noncollege students (Gallander Wintre et al., 2001), this could indicate that the relations between microaggressions and outcomes could be different in noncollege student samples. However, only the relationship with job outcomes was affected by sample occupation, where the relationship was weaker for student samples than it was for mixed or employed samples. This difference is likely due to the lack of work experience among student samples. The general similarities between samples suggests that microaggressions are problematic across a variety of contexts, and both organizations and universities should be proactive in educating about microaggressions to prevent them from occurring.

Moreover, our results indicate that microaggressions affect nonstigmatized individuals as well as stigmatized group members. The results of this meta-analysis found that the relationship between microaggressions and job outcomes was stronger for samples consisting of only stigmatized individuals than for samples including nonstigmatized individuals, supporting what minority stress theory (Meyer, 1995, 2003) would predict. However, for psychological well-being, physical health, and negative coping, there were negative relations with microaggressions for both types of samples. This suggests that microaggressions are generally detrimental to all who experience them, and that the decision to exclude nonstigmatized group members is driven primarily by definition than by evidence.

4.1 | Implications
Our findings suggest that individuals and organizations should take action to curtail microaggressions. Microaggressions are negatively associated with the psychological well-being and physical health of individuals, regardless of their occupation or membership in a stigmatized group. Hence, it is important to educate others on what constitutes microaggressions and why they are harmful to inhibit their frequency. This is especially important because workplaces and university campuses are becoming more diverse (Ryan & Bauman, 2016; Toossi & Joyner, 2018; Toossi & Morisi, 2017). Increasing diversity means individuals are more likely to meet others who differ from them (e.g., in race, nationality, religion, etc.), so it is important for people to understand how even seemingly innocuous actions or phrases can be perceived as offensive by others.

Yet, it is also important to help individuals cope with microaggressions when they occur. According to COR theory, individuals engage in coping behaviors to regain resources or protect against resource loss. But not all coping strategies are equally helpful. While this is most evident with negative coping mechanisms, even positive coping mechanisms differ in their utility. Shiota (2006), for example, found that positive reappraisal was associated with well-being, but problem-focused coping was unrelated to well-being, and seeking support was associated with lower distress, but not well-being. While our results suggest that individuals do use positive coping mechanisms in response to microaggressions, reliance on these methods could be strengthened by developing programs to teach individuals how to use these coping mechanisms to meet their well-being needs. Organizations who support employees in their pursuit of these positive coping behaviors may in turn reap benefits related to their organizational outcomes, such as improved job performance (Hunter, 2011).

4.2 | Limitations and future directions
This meta-analysis is not without its limitations. For example, we did not examine how methodological factors such as variation in study design influenced the generalizability of our results due to small ks. This could lead to bias in our results, although any bias would likely be small as most of the studies included in this meta-analysis used cross-sectional survey designs. This means, however, that we cannot conclude that microaggressions caused any of the outcome variable examined. The use of longitudinal and experimental designs in microaggression research is infrequent (see Ong et al., 2013; Tao et al., 2017 for exceptions), so future research should utilize these study designs to strengthen our understanding of the impact microaggressions have on individuals. These designs would also allow researchers to examine how time plays a role in the effects of microaggressive experiences. Researchers should examine whether one microaggressive experience is enough to negatively affect individuals and whether the impact of microaggressions grows as the experiences become more consistent.

In addition, our ability to conduct moderation analyses was limited because of small sample sizes. Specifically, we were unable to conduct moderation analyses for the inclusion of nonstigmatized individuals for positive coping, and the small number of studies used for nearly all moderation analyses could also lead to second-order sampling error affecting our results. More research on these areas is necessary to determine how factors such as the type of microaggression being examined, publication status of the paper, inclusion of nonstigmatized group members, and sample occupation may moderate these effects, as the high levels of heterogeneity suggest that the relationships among microaggressions and outcomes are not consistent.

Furthermore, future research should also examine the use of objective measures for physical health and psychological well-being whenever it is possible. The reliance on self-report in surveys used for microaggression research means that common method bias may be inflating relations between variables. Researchers could mitigate this problem and address prior criticisms of microaggression research (e.g., Lilienfeld, 2017, 2020) by using more objective measures. For example, assessing health via organizational records of sick days or stress via cortisol swabs and blood pressure monitors could help attenuate common method bias and provide a more objective test of the relationships examined within this meta-analysis.

5 | CONCLUSION
Much has been written about microaggressions in recent years, and a great deal of controversy surrounds the subject. This meta-analysis examined the relations between microaggressions and psychological well-being, physical health, job outcomes, and positive and negative coping, and it also examined what factors affected these relationships. We found that microaggressions were negatively associated with psychological well-being, physical health, and job outcomes and they were positively associated with positive coping. Typically, these effects did not depend on the type of microaggression being studied, the year in which the study was conducted, the publication status of the study, the occupation of the sample, or whether only members of stigmatized groups were included. Thus, microaggressive behaviors are detrimental across most individuals and contexts, and additional policies need to be implemented and actions taken to identify and reduce their prevalence. ‚Äã","While research on microaggressions has accumulated in recent decades, doubts have arisen over their impact on individuals. Hence, the purpose of this study was to analyze the relations between microaggressions and psychological well-being, physical health, job outcomes, and positive and negative coping. Potential moderators (i.e., microaggression target, publication year, publication status, sample occupation, and inclusion of nonstigmatized group members) were also examined. A meta-analytic approach was chosen to summarize the findings in the microaggression literature. Several search terms and databases were used to identify articles for inclusion. After review, a total of 141 articles with 154 samples contributed effect sizes to our analyses. The results showed that microaggressions were negatively related to psychological well-being and physical health and positively related to coping. The pattern of results was generally the same regardless of the microaggression target, the year the study was conducted, the publication status of the paper, the occupation of the sample, and whether the sample included nonstigmatized groups members or not. This meta-analysis demonstrates the stable, harmful effects associated with experiencing microaggressions. Specifically, microaggressions predicted negative outcomes across individuals and contexts. Thus, actions should be taken to decrease their prevalence withineducational and occupational settings.","4",0,"4","Political",2,0

International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 95, 103885. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2023.103885","Over the last several decades, we have learned a great deal about how disasters affect local communities. Because disasters are, by definition, unpredictable, we often lack insight into how individual attitudes and behaviors shift after a large-scale disaster. In this study, we were able to make use of uniquely positioned set of surveys to gauge the affect of Hurricane Harvey on disaster-related attitudes and behaviors in two coastal shoreline communities.

Overall, the bivariate results tell a mostly positive story. After a major storm, social trust and confidence in local community organizations appears to increase, and residents were more open to a wide range of resilience-building policies. Recovery is the time where disaster risk reduction is most likely to occur, when the focus can shift to long-term reduction of vulnerability through the development of local capacity, the restoration of community assets, and the development of resilient infrastructure [24]. Further, these resilience-building policies could support risk reduction in a number of the dimensions identified as part of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Reduction (2015-2030) if data are collected to adequately measure progress in the U.S [25]. Were we to end the analysis here, we might conclude on a mostly positive note. Major disasters appear to build community resilience.

The multivariate analysis, however, reveals a more nuanced account. First, local residents who experienced the greatest amount of storm-related damage expressed greater skepticism toward local community organizations and were less supportive of new building standards, restrictions on building new structures, and increased taxes. Hurricanes may build resilience primarily among those who are back in the houses quickly, who spent little time with power or water, and did not lose wages as a result of the storm. Second, attentiveness to local news increased confidence in at least some local community organizations but reduced support for many of the resilience-building policies necessary to protect the local community from future disasters. This is perhaps not surprising as previous research indicates that local news coverage of a disaster is event-centered and episodic, often failing to present context and failing to raise more fundamental questions than ‚Äúwho is responsible‚Äù for disaster management [26]. In addition, news coverage is mostly negative and reflects and protects local economic interests [27]. As a result, a major disaster may help to build resilience through increased trust and support for hurricane mitigation but it does so primarily through its effect on those individuals least affected by the storm. Similarly, news coverage may serve to increase confidence in local organizations but may also undermine support of hurricane mitigation.

These findings should also be considered alongside a ‚Äúnear miss‚Äù or ‚Äúfalse expectation‚Äù interpretation of the disaster event's impact on risk perception and support for mitigation and resilience building [22,28]. Those who were not affected by the storm may perceive the hurricane as a false alarm, which may lead them to perceive less risk and little need to take protective action in future emergencies. In other words, they have a false expectation that the area is safe from future disaster impacts and that they have adequate resilience to withstand events that may occur. Alternatively, if those who were not affected view the hurricane as an event that almost happened, they may be more likely to support mitigation to reduce vulnerability to future events. Given the findings of this study, an improved understanding of the ways in which near misses and false alarms may be associated with increased or decreased risk perceptions should be a focus of planning, education, and communication around mitigation and resilience building. This is particularly important in highly vulnerable, frequently threatened regions like the Texas Gulf Coast.

This study has several important limitations. As mentioned above, we were only able to re-contact respondents in two of the counties from the original survey although three of the four counties in the initial study were impacted by Hurricane Harvey, which could have led to selection bias. While respondents were asked to report different types of damage they incurred as a result of Hurricane Harvey, responses were not validated through windshield surveys or other types of in-person assessment, which could have led to exposure misclassification if damage was not accurately reported. Respondents also self-reported behaviors, attitudes, media exposure, and perceptions of various factors that have been reported to be associated with support for resilience policies and investments in prior research. However, both recall and response bias are possible given the amount of time that passed between the landfall of Hurricane Harvey and the potential social desirability bias to appear concerned about the need to increase mitigation and build resilience in light of more frequent and severe disasters impacting the Texas coast and the larger U.S. Gulf region. Actual resilience policies could impact the respondents‚Äô perception of resilience policies. However, Texas has relatively weak planning authority and few planning mandates‚Äîas well as low levels of staff capacity and technical assistance‚Äîmaking it unlikely that existing policies drove perception [29]. Finally, decision-making biases could have been present among those who reported more damage if they underestimated the likelihood of future losses in the near term following a major disaster [30].

5. Conclusion
After Hurricane Harvey, individuals recognized they were less prepared and that recovery would take longer than expected. At the same time, social trust increased as did confidence in local government and support for increasing building standards and restricting new building structures and housing in high-risk areas. We find no change in support for increased taxes or financial incentives to relocate. These shifts in attitudes were largely offset by reported hurricane damage, meaning individuals who reported experiencing the most damage became less trusting, expressed less confidence in local organizations, and were less supportive of resilience-building policies. As the scope and scale of disaster-associated damages increase along with the frequency and severity of disasters, these findings can provide important insight to emergency preparedness planners and policymakers as they develop strategies to increase resilience, particularly in repetitive loss areas like the Texas Gulf Coast.","In this study, we take advantage of a temporarily unique panel survey to examine how Hurricane Harvey shifted individual perceptions of coastal resilience in two coastal shoreline counties (Galveston and Brazoria) directly affected by the storm.

International Journal of Selection and Assessment, 29(1), 65‚Äì80. https://doi.org/10.1111/ijsa.12315","The present study examined one of three posited explanations, specifically, the testing environment hypothesis, for the conflicting evidence regarding UIT device-type effects on measures of cognitively loaded constructs between operational and nonoperational studies. It was hypothesized that the GMA test scores for those using smartphones (i.e., highly permissible device) to complete the test in a distracting environment would be (a) lower than the scores obtained for those using either desktop computers (i.e., device low in permissibility) or smartphones to complete the same test in a nondistracting environment, and (b) more strongly correlated with selective attention test scores compared to the same relationship observed for those who complete the GMA test in the nondistracting environment, irrespective of the particular device used. Concerning the former, the GMA test and retest scores were virtually identical for the three conditions. This was despite the fact that those who completed the GMA test outdoors were more likely to report having found the environment to be more distracting and had greater difficulty concentrating than those who completed the test indoors for both the first and second administrations of the GMA test. So, whereas the manipulation of environmental distractibility was successful, it did not translate into GMA test-score differences between those who reported being distracted and those who reported not being distracted. This effect was further reflected in the finding that the GMA/selective attention relationships did not statistically differ between the three conditions. Moreover, neither the GMA/SAT nor GMA/GPA relationships differed between the conditions.

The pattern of results observed in the present study highlight the continued need to examine and make sense of the circumstances under which UIT device-type effects on cognitive test scores occur. Consequently, future research should examine whether and the extent to which (a) the ability to self-select UIT devices, and (b) the high-stakes nature of UITs account for the discrepancy in the observed results between operational and nonoperational studies. It is also plausible that the observed difference between operational nd nonoperational studies results from the interactive effect of all three explanations (i.e., high-stakes, self-selection, and testing environment); that is, an interactive effect of all three explanations might be required to obtain device-type effects.

6.1 | Limitations, suggestions for future research, and conclusions
A review of the mobile testing literature reveals that the setting of a given study appears to coincide with whether or not UIT device-type effects are observed. Specifically, test score differences between those who used ‚Äòmobile‚Äô versus ‚Äònonmobile‚Äô devices to complete cognitive tests have been consistently observed in operational studies, but have been absent in nonoperational studies. Despite approximating the operational context to a greater degree than prior nonoperational studies, there is an evident mismatch between the typical operational context and the present study. Specifically, in addition to the testing environment, Arthur and colleagues (Arthur et al., 2014; Arthur et al., 2018; Arthur & Traylor, 2019) posited two additional explanations for why UIT device-type effects have been found only in operational contexts: (a) the high-stakes nature of employment-related testing, and (b) applicants' ability to choose the device on which UITs are completed. That is, the testing stakes for participants in operational studies (i.e., job applicants) are unequivocally high because applicants are vying for a limited number of job openings. In stark contrast, the testing stakes for participants in nonoperational studies are low, and perhaps nonexistent, because test scores neither help nor impede the achievement of any particularly important objective(s). Furthermore, even if the testing stakes in nonoperational studies were on par with those within operational settings, the reliance on undergraduate college students precludes generalizations to the general population of job applicants and subsequently limits the population validity of the present findings.

Related to the preceding, the use of a young, age-restricted sample may have attenuated the observed results, thereby reducing the ability to obtain the hypothesized effects. The majority of those who participated in the nonoperational studies (i.e., first- and second-year undergraduate students) that have failed to find UIT device-type effects on cognitive test scores (see Table 1), including the present study, belong to a generation that has never witnessed a world wherein these technologies were not available and ubiquitous (see Pew Research Center, 2019). Because information-processing abilities such as selective attention decline with age (Plude et al., 1994), the present study's age-restricted sample (i.e., 18‚Äì26) might be another reason the hypothesized selective attention effects were not obtained. Indeed, the present results would suggest that the study's age cohort's inherent familiarity with such devices may have acclimatized them to using smartphones in distracting environments. Thus, an interesting question is whether the study's results would be replicated with a more diverse sample in general, and a more age-diverse sample in particular.

Another potential limitation pertains to the considerable difference with respect to how device-type groups are formed in operational and nonoperational studies. For UITs administered in operational settings, applicants are typically able to choose their own test-taking device. Consequently, device-type groups are naturally formed via self-selection (i.e., applicants self-selecting their test-taking device). To the extent that the testing stakes were low for the present sample, in addition to the fact that random assignment to conditions was used, the ecological validity of the observed results is open to critique. However, the above design choices were deliberately made to maximize internal validity because by (a) holding self-selection constant by randomly assigning participants to devices, (b) holding testing-stakes constant by making it low-stakes for all participants, and (c) manipulating only the testing environment (i.e., distracting vs. nondistracting), it was possible to isolate the effects of the testing environment. Nevertheless, these issues highlight the point that if subsequent nonoperational studies were to increase the testing stakes, allow participants to self-select their test-taking device, or both, perhaps the presumed ‚ÄòUIT device-type‚Äô effects consistently observed by operational studies would be found, and thus, corroborate the hypothesis that the effect is due to either or both of these context-specific study characteristics.

It is also important to acknowledge that the testing environment was manipulated at a broad level, and that there are certainly individual differences regarding the extent to which a given distraction source is actually distracting (e.g., some people listen to music while working, whereas others cannot work unless it is absolutely silent). Furthermore, although the extremes of Gray et al.‚Äôs (2015) continuum were used such that the nonmobile (desktop) condition represented a static, indoor, and private space (low distraction), this is not meant to imply that one cannot be distracted while completing an assessment on a desktop. Likewise, it is also not meant to suggest that one is necessarily distracted while completing assessments on smartphones. For instance, in an examination of the relationship between interruptions and test performance and UITs in operational settings, Lawrence et al. (2017) reported that a wide range of interruptions and distractions (e.g., receiving pop-ups, push notifications, emails, text messages, phone calls, technical issues, being directly spoken to, having people around, background noises) were reported by test takers completing assessments on both mobile and nonmobile devices. In addition, their results showed that the device type moderated the relationship between interruptions and test performance such that, counterintuitively, nonmobile test takers‚Äô scores were more influenced by interruptions than mobile test takers‚Äô scores. However, importantly, the scores reflected noncognitive ‚Äòcompetencies‚Äô (e.g., teamwork, safety orientation, responsibility, work ethic, quality focus) and not cognitive constructs.

Finally, in the present study, participants in the smartphone conditions were required to bring and use their own smartphone. The specific make and model of smartphone was neither standardized nor controlled across participants, and so in recognition of the fact that different phones have different features and characteristics, this may have introduced some extraneous variability into these conditions. Consequently, post hoc, we empirically examined this issue. Specifically, because participants were asked to self-report the device (i.e., make and model) they used to complete the GMA test, we were able to use this information to obtain and code-specific device-type characteristics (e.g., screen size [diagonal], processing speed [GHz], screen resolution). Importantly, subsequent reanalyses that included these device-type characteristics did not substantively alter the results.

In conclusion, the present study responded to recent calls for research examining UIT device-type effects on common personnel selection procedures (Morelli et al., 2017). The primary objective was to empirically examine the extent to which the testing environment hypothesis (Arthur et al., 2014; Arthur et al., 2018; Arthur & Traylor, 2019) accounts for the discrepancy between operational and nonoperational studies with respect to observing UIT device-type effects on cognitively loaded measures. Broadly speaking, within the specified boundary conditions of the study‚Äîthat is, a controlled lab experiment whereby participants were randomly assigned to the testing environment and the device type‚Äîthe present findings suggest that the testing environment, and the distractions therein, do not account for this discrepancy when using a sample of undergraduate students, the majority of whom were born post-1999. Thus, in the absence of a replication with a more age-diverse sample, the present results subsequently lend credence to alternative explanations regarding the particular mechanism(s) for the observed device-type effects including, but not limited to, the self-selection and testing-stakes hypotheses (Arthur et al., 2014; Arthur et al., 2018; Arthur & Traylor, 2019). In sum, the present results highlight the continued need for empirical work in the domain of mobile assessments.","Device-type effects on cognitive tests appear to covary with whether unproctored internet-based test (UIT) scores were obtained operationally or nonoperationally. The present study examined whether the testing environment and distractions therein‚Äîone of three contextual factors identified as plausible explanations‚Äîaccounts for this covariation. Four-hundred and twenty-five college students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions which differed by the testing environment and device used to complete a cognitive test. Test scores did not differ between conditions despite greater distractions reported by those who tested in the distracting environment. Results were replicated within-study, and suggest that the self-selection and testing-stakes hypotheses warrant subsequent empirical examination as explanations for the differences in device-type effects observed in operational and nonoperational settings.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,1

Our meta-analysis suggests that research on psychological dispositions and ideology ought to put the distinction between social and economic conservatism front and center (Claessens et al., 2020), address contextual factors that condition ideological coherence (Jost et al., 2009; Federico & Malka, 2018, Johnston et al., 2017; Malka & Soto, 2015), and formulate and evaluate theories on the basis of accounting for heterogeneity (in addition to the traditional yardsticks; Linden & H√∂nekopp, 2021).

Here, we leverage several methodological and theoretical sources of this controversy to conduct an extensive quantitative review with the dual aims of probing the RRH‚Äôs basic assumptions and parsing the RRH literature‚Äôs heterogeneity. Using multilevel meta-analyses of relations between varieties of rigidity and ideology measures alongside a bevy of potential moderators (s = 329, k = 708, N = 187,612), we find that associations between conservatism and rigidity are tremendously heterogeneous, suggesting a complex‚Äîyet conceptually fertile‚Äînetwork of relations between these constructs. Most notably, whereas social conservatism was robustly associated with rigidity, associations between economic conservatism and rigidity indicators were inconsistent, small, and not statistically significant outside of the United States. Moderator analyses revealed that nonrepresentative sampling, criterion contamination, and disproportionate use of American samples have yielded overestimates of associations between rigidity-related constructs and conservatism in past research. We resolve that drilling into this complexity, thereby moving beyond the question of if conservatives are essentially rigid to when and why they might or might not be, will help provide a more realistic account of the psychological underpinnings of political ideology. ‚Äã","6",0,"6","Political",4,0

Stepping outside the echo chamber: Is intellectual humility associated with less political myside bias? Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 48(1), 150‚Äì164. https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167221997619","IH manifested negative, although typically small, relations with political myside bias across measures and samples, even for issues that participants held with great conviction. These results suggest that IH may lessen the influence of partisan cues on decision-making processes, although future research leveraging longitudinal designs is needed to corroborate these interpretations. The majority of these correlations (70%) replicated across samples in terms of their statistical significance, and all results replicated in terms of the direction of the correlations.

In addition, covarying for Honesty-Humility and political conviction tended to not significantly alter the relations between IH and political myside bias, indicating that these associations were relatively specific to IH. There was also consistent evidence for political symmetry in the relations between IH and political myside bias, as the associations did not significantly differ across Republicans and Democrats. Even though IH was associated with liberal ideology, controlling for political ideology did not significantly alter IH-bias relations.

There was some evidence for a suppressor effect when covarying for Honesty-Humility, meaning the regression coefficient for the relation between IH and political myside bias became larger after accounting for IH‚Äôs shared variance with Honesty-Humility. These results may indicate that the metacognitive aspects of IH may be more robust predictors of less political myside bias than humility at large. Nevertheless, none of these effects replicated across samples, a common occurrence with suppressor effects in psychological science (see Watson et al., 2013), and we are cautious to overinterpret these results.

IH was related to less partisan bias in the Flip-Flopping and Forgiveness paradigms. These results, however, tended to be small and in some cases nonsignificant. It is possible that issues surrounding internal consistency reliability may have influenced IH-bias relations, as difference score measures often suffer in terms of their internal consistency reliabilities (Shanock et al., 2010). Nevertheless, internal consistency estimates exceeded recommended cutoffs for adequate reliability in the present investigation (e.g., >.70; see Taber, 2018) in most cases (92%). Thus, the ‚Äútrue‚Äù effects may be small, and IH may be a relatively weak negative correlate of these measures of partisan bias. Future research is needed to clarify the robustness of these relations and potential boundaries on them. For instance, these paradigms referred to a vague description of a political candidate. Consistent with research on reference group effects in cross-cultural studies (Heine et al., 2002), differences in mental representations of political candidates may bear on the relations between IH and partisan bias. Still, our results conceptually replicate results from previous studies examining political forgiveness and perceptions of flip-flopping (Hodges et al., 2020; Leary et al., 2017).

Moreover, IH was related to less political myside bias even when partisan cues were embedded in a nonpolitical decision-making paradigm (i.e., choosing a scholarship winner), and these results were consistent across political party. Our findings may indicate that IH may constrain the diffuse spread of partisan identity in peoples‚Äô day-to-day lives. In addition, IH was related to choosing the scholarship candidate based on academic achievement rather than community and extracurricular involvement. Academic achievement was the most compelling indicator of candidate qualification in this paradigm, as it was the only variable that was meaningfully altered across the two r√©sum√©s. Our results are consistent with studies finding that IH is related to enhanced metacognitive abilities (Krumrei-Mancuso et al., 2020).

IH was also consistently significantly associated with less biased assimilation concerning one‚Äôs openness to discussing the argument with the author, and these relations were large across samples and measures. Moreover, IH tended to be moderately associated with less biased assimilation concerning perceptions of the author‚Äôs attributes and respect for the author‚Äôs position. In contrast, IH was less consistently related to biased assimilation regarding the argument, particularly concerning the global warming arguments. Given that there is considerable scientific consensus concerning anthropogenic global warming, it is possible that intellectually humble individuals preferred arguments supported by science. Indeed, IH was weakly and positively related to believing in anthropogenic global warming. As such, these results are potentially consistent with frameworks advancing that political ‚Äúbias‚Äù is not always irrational, as some beliefs are more scientifically sound than others (Baron & Jost, 2019).

We found that IH may lessen selective exposure, as it was weakly to moderately negatively associated with selecting articles that support one‚Äôs preexisting views. IH was weakly positively associated with selecting articles that contradict one‚Äôs preexisting views, although most of these correlations were nonsignificant. These results conflict somewhat with those of Porter and Schumann (2018): They found that IH was moderately positively related to selecting disconfirmatory political information. Although the reasons for this discrepancy across studies are unclear, there may be boundary conditions on the relation between IH and the selection of disconfirmatory political information. For instance, we assessed different topics than Porter and Schumann (2018), and we used different measures of IH. Future research is needed to clarify the generalizability of our results across measures of IH and political topics.

In addition, politics-specific IH often manifested relations with political myside bias that were significantly larger than domain-general IH. These results are consistent with studies examining the relations between indices of IH and affective polarization (Bowes et al., 2020; Nadelhoffer et al., 2020). Politics-specific IH may be especially important for fairly evaluating one‚Äôs political beliefs, even those held with great conviction, as it may buffer against undue political certainty (Hoyle et al., 2016). Existing research and results from the present study indicate that domain-specific IH tends to decrease as belief certainty in that domain increases. Such results may suggest that individuals who are intellectually humble about their political beliefs can accurately assess the evidentiary support for their political views, justifiably contributing to less political certainty.

It is also possible, however, that politics-specific IH at least partially reflects low political conviction, which may raise questions regarding the construct validity of domain-specific IH. Scholars contend that IH should be distinct from diffidence or apathy, as IH reflects how people interact with their beliefs as opposed to how strongly they feel about their beliefs (Alfano et al., 2018; Krumrei-Mancuso & Rouse, 2016). Nevertheless, research in this area is mixed, as some studies indicate that politics-specific IH is related to more interest in following politics and less dislike of political discussion (Krumrei-Mancuso & Newman, 2020). Additional research is needed to clarify the extent to which politics-specific IH is imbued with diffidence.

Limitations and Future Directions
Although the current study is one of the most comprehensive examinations of IH and political myside bias to date, it was characterized by limitations that merit consideration in future research. First, our study was cross-sectional, precluding formal conclusions regarding temporal precedence, let alone causality, in the relations between IH and political myside bias. Research examining the development of IH and political myside bias is needed. Rodriguez et al. (2017), for example, examined the trajectories of political media consumption over a period of 12 years, affording the opportunity to examine the developmental trends of selective exposure. Such research could be conducted in conjunction with measures of IH to ascertain whether IH reduces selective exposure and vice versa. Perhaps individuals who score low on IH and high on partisanship would manifest the most pronounced increases in partisan selective exposure.

Our study represents a preliminary step along the larger path of exploring causality, and, as such, future research is needed to clarify the cognitive and affective mechanisms that may bear on the relations between IH and political myside bias. Such research may inform studies aiming to employ bias mitigation strategies in political discourse. For instance, IH may directly reduce political myside bias, and this possibility warrants consideration. In addition to or in lieu of this possibility, IH may reduce political myside bias indirectly via still unspecified mediators, such as empathy or negative emotions such as anger. For instance, one compelling mechanism by which IH may reduce political myside bias is by decreasing negative emotions, such as anger, experienced when faced with potentially disconfirming political information (Hodge et al., 2020a; Suhay & Erisen, 2018), IH may contribute to a greater appreciation for nuanced arguments and perhaps lower anger in the face of opposing views (Maggard et al., 2018; Hoyle et al., 2016).

This article reports the findings of preliminary studies exploring the nomological network of IH in political contexts. Future research could draw upon these findings to develop theories about the nature of IH relative to politics, test these within longitudinal or experimental paradigms, and utilize structural equation modeling to establish a measurement model of various self-report measures of IH. This could help account for potential nonnormality in distributions of IH and simultaneously account for the relations among IH indicators, which were robustly positively associated in the present studies.

Moreover, many paradigmatic designs of political myside bias, including those used in the present study, are potentially confounded with a priori political beliefs, accuracy motivations, perceived source trustworthiness, political engagement, and other processes/constructs relevant to political decision-making (Tappin et al., 2020). As such, it is challenging to establish that politically motivated reasoning causes same-party favoritism and the selection of politically congenial information on these paradigms over and above other related processes. Given that IH may predispose to holding certain political views (e.g., support for views surrounding anthropogenic climate change), which in turn may affect political reasoning largely independent of politically motivated reasoning, future research is needed to clarify the decision-making mechanisms by which IH reduces political myside bias. For instance, IH may reduce political myside bias vis-√†-vis reducing politically motivated reasoning, but it may additionally or separately reduce political myside bias vis-√†-vis enhancing accuracy motivations. Consistent with the notion of decreasing reliance on paradigmatic measures of political myside bias, research is also needed to examine whether these findings generalize to more ecologically valid paradigms, such as the types and frequency of political social media postings (Simchon et al., 2020).

In addition, we primarily utilized a within-subjects rather than a between-subjects design to assess political myside bias. Although a within-subjects design possesses several advantages over a between-subjects design, including greater statistical power, it comes with several disadvantages (Leary, 2017). Political myside bias, for instance, is attenuated when using a within-subjects compared with a between-subjects design (Crawford et al., 2015). Sensitization may contribute to this attenuation in effect sizes, as participants may infer the purpose of the study and subsequently be motivated to reduce their biases. Independent replication efforts are warranted using multiple methodological approaches, including between-subjects designs, to elucidate the robustness of these relations.

Conclusion
Our results provisionally indicate that IH is related to less political myside bias across paradigms, political topics, and samples. Even when political beliefs were held with great conviction, IH was associated with less political myside bias and same-party favoritism. Research is needed to investigate whether IH can be increased, at least in the short term, to reduce political myside bias. Such research could also clarify whether increases in domain-general IH, politics-specific IH, or both are sufficient for mitigating against political myside bias. Our results are consistent with a burgeoning literature on the links between IH and religious tolerance (Hook et al., 2017). Our findings, thus, may bear implications for religious myside bias; we encourage researchers to investigate whether our findings generalize to other domains of bias and ideological extremism.","In recent years, an upsurge of polarization has been a salient feature of political discourse in America. A small but growing body of research has examined the potential relevance of intellectual humility (IH) to political polarization. In the present investigation, we extend this work to political myside bias, testing the hypothesis that IH is associated with less bias in two community samples (N‚ÇÅ = 498; N‚ÇÇ = 477). In line with our expectations, measures of IH were negatively correlated with political myside bias across paradigms, political topics, and samples. These relations were robust to controlling for humility. We also examined ideological asymmetries in the relations between IH and political myside bias, finding that IH‚Äìbias relations were statistically equivalent in members of the political left and right. Notwithstanding important limitations and caveats, these data establish IH as one of a small handful of psychological features known to predict less political myside bias.","3",0,"3","Political",4,0

Journal of Safety Research, 72, 153‚Äì164. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsr.2019.12.010","The current study extends workplace safety research by examining the role of counterfactual thinking on workplace safety behavior. This study contributes three new insights to the workplace safety literature. First, upward counterfactuals had a significant effect on safety compliance and safety participation. Based on the correlations in Table 1, downward counterfactuals did not have a significant effect on safety compliance and safety participation. Second, safety knowledge operated as a mediating mechanism between upward counterfactuals and safety compliance, as well as safety participation. Third, the internal safety locus of control amplified the effects of counterfactuals on safety behavior through safety knowledge.

11. Theoretical implications
The results of this study contribute to the counterfactual and workplace safety research literatures by extending prior knowledge in several ways. Past workplace safety research within organizational psychology and behavior does not explicitly take into consideration counterfactual thinking, or even broad cognitive processes. The current study is the first known empirical test of the relationship between counterfactual thinking and supervisor-reported safety behavior. On the basis of the current results, individuals reflecting on better alternatives to negative outcomes are more likely to engage in safe behavior in the future. This result highlights the role of one specific cognitive process when predicting workplace safety behavior. According to the accident sequence model proposed by Ramsey (1985), cognitive processes influence perception and interpretation of hazards and decisions to avoid them in hazardous situations. Consistent with the previous findings from social and organizational psychology (e.g., Morris & Moore, 2000), the current study demonstrated that counterfactual thinking is an important antecedent of safety behavior in the workplace. Future research could examine broader cognitive constructs that impact safety behavior.

Second, consistent with the cognitive mechanisms identified in the functional theory of counterfactual thinking (Epstude and Roese, 2008, Roese and Epstude, 2017), safety knowledge served as an explanatory mechanism for the relationship between upward counterfactual thinking and safety compliance, as well as safety participation. In other words, upward counterfactual thinking had an indirect effect on both obligatory and discretionary behavior through safety knowledge. Also, consistent with the previous cross-sectional research on safety-related counterfactual thinking on self-reported learning (Morris & Moore, 2000), upward counterfactual thinking may facilitate safety behavior by fostering individuals‚Äô learning about safety practices.

Unexpectedly, safety motivation was not an explanatory mechanism for the relationship between upward counterfactuals and safety behaviors. This unanticipated result might be due to the broad time period over which participants were instructed to reflect when responding to the safety motivation items. However, this same time period was used in the safety knowledge measure. Theoretically, safety motivation should be heightened immediately following and in response to counterfactual thinking and likely declines over time. Future research could utilize an experience sampling method in which counterfactual thinking and motivation could be assessed simultaneously.

Finally, counterfactual thinking had stronger effects on safety behavior for individuals with an internal safety locus of control. These results begin to reveal the importance of individual differences for the functional theory of counterfactual thinking. Since nurses in our sample had significantly higher levels of internal safety locus of control than doctors (as displayed in the correlation matrix in Table 1), this pattern of relationships may be even stronger for them. Further research is needed to determine if these differences in internal safety locus of control are dispositional or situational.

12. Practical implications
The current research has several practical implications for workplace safety improvements. First, it provides initial evidence for the relationship between counterfactuals and safety behavior, suggesting that counterfactual training may be a useful workplace safety intervention (cf. Dillon & Tinsley, 2008). Such training should highlight the distinction between and consequences of upward and downward counterfactuals. Managers could also encourage their employees to engage in upward counterfactuals when incidents, injuries, or near misses occur in order to learn from them and prevent them from happening again. In addition to training and motivating individuals to pursue counterfactual thinking (cf. Dillon & Tinsley, 2008), organizations could recruit individuals who are more likely to engage in counterfactual thinking and/or learn from their own or others‚Äô experiences.

Moreover, the finding that safety knowledge plays a central role in explaining the effects of counterfactuals on safety behavior also suggests that experience-based learning is critical to behavioral improvement. Therefore, organizations could use learning potential as an employee selection criterion and create a climate that promotes learning and personal growth, encouraging individuals to obtain knowledge and develop skills from past negative experiences in order to avoid them in the future. Leaders should also make an effort to raise employees‚Äô awareness of the importance of learning from these safety-related events.

Furthermore, our results showed that individuals with a high internal safety locus of control appear to benefit more (in terms of two forms of safety behavior: compliance and participation) from upward counterfactual thoughts than individuals with a low internal locus of control. Recruiters could identify people who are prone to perceive events as personally controllable in selection procedures, as this trait could maximize individuals‚Äô learning from past negative experiences. Alternatively or in addition, incident/near miss investigators could emphasize aspects of negative events that were within the employee‚Äôs control and what they personally could have done differently or this information could be emphasized in an after action review/debrief.

13. Limitations and future research directions
Despite collecting data from two sources at three different time periods and thereby avoiding issues of same-source bias (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003), this study has some limitations. First, because specific information about the safety-related events was not collected, details surrounding the event (e.g., whether it was a near miss, incident, or injury) are unknown. Recognizing the demands of open-ended survey items and culturally-related apprehensions, this was an intentional decision to not probe the respondents with such personal experiences. Dillon and Tinsley (2008) noted that whether a near miss is considered an event that almost happened or one that could have happened influences the resulting counterfactual‚Äôs functionality, such that those interpreted as almost happened induce counterfactual-based learning but those interpreted as could have happened may not (Kahneman & Varey, 1990). Additionally, it is unknown whether the negative event under consideration was something the individual experienced themselves, observed, or simply heard about. Although it is possible that the degree of counterfactual-based learning may vary from these different types of negative events, it is important to note that research has shown counterfactual-based learning from each of these event types (Morris and Moore, 2000, Roese, 1994, Walker et al., 2016). It is also likely that event severity relates to counterfactual generation. Future studies should gather more information about the negative safety-related event, which would allow for a more nuanced examination of the event (e.g., differentiating near misses from injuries). Future research should consider such event characteristics and explore how they influence counterfactual-based processes.

Second, counterfactually-driven affect and experiential learning was not directly measured. However, previous research has shown that the upward (but not downward) counterfactual items used in this study correlated positively with negative affective measures (i.e., depression, rumination, pessimism; Rye et al., 2008). Nevertheless, future research using real-time assessment should examine the nature and intensity of the affect, specific experiential learning, and how they relate to other variables. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the relationship between counterfactual thinking and safety-related behaviors and outcomes, multiple mediators should be assessed simultaneously. For instance, counterfactual thinking may heighten awareness of and respect for workplace risks. Accounting for additional relevant variables will also likely increase the magnitude of the correlations and percent of variance accounted for; however, even small relationships can have practical value when predicting workplace safety behavior.

Third, safety in the workplace is complex and any given study is unlikely to capture all relevant variables. Nevertheless, it is important to contextualize our findings and accumulate knowledge relative to other known predictors. Thus, it is important to further determine the nomological network for safety behavior in the workplace and embed counterfactual thinking within this. Thus future research should include leadership (Mullen & Kelloway, 2009), organizational accountability (Morris & Moore, 2000), among other known predictors, and test the incremental validity of counterfactual thinking above and beyond these known predictors. It would also be good to obtain more distinct assessments of the mediators and dependent variables, given their strong intercorrelations in this study.

To further our understanding of the moderating effects of individual differences on functional counterfactual thinking, future research should expand the types of individual differences assessed. For instance, personality traits and self-efficacy might influence how counterfactuals impact safety knowledge, motivation, and behavior. Additionally, situational factors might also enhance functional counterfactual effects. Correspondingly, a more sophisticated moderated mediation model that incorporates these variables could be tested (cf. Smith-Crowe, Burke, & Landis, 2003). Finally, research should attempt to replicate the current findings by collecting data in different industries to determine the generalizability of the results.

14. Conclusion
This study is the first empirical study demonstrating the influence of counterfactual thinking on workplace safety behavior. Specifically, upward counterfactuals (thinking about how things could have been better) were positively associated with safety compliance and participation. This type of thinking had a stronger influence on safety knowledge and behavior than downward counterfactuals (thinking about how things could have been worse). Moreover, evidence supported safety knowledge as a mechanism explaining the relationship between upward counterfactuals and safety behavior. In addition, safety locus of control enhanced the effect of upward counterfactuals on safety behavior by amplifying the impact of upward counterfactuals on safety knowledge. This study provides a foundation from which future research can build to advance our understanding of how cognitive processes influence workplace safety behavior.","Introduction: Information processing theories of workplace safety suggest that cognition is an antecedent of safety behavior. However, little research has directly tested cognitive factors as predictors of workplace safety within organizational psychology and behavior research. Counterfactuals (cognitions about ‚Äúwhat might have been‚Äù) can be functional when they consist of characteristics (e.g., ‚Äúupward‚Äù ‚Äì focusing on better outcomes) that alter behavior in a manner consistent with those outcomes. This field study aimed to examine the influence of counterfactual thinking on safety behavior and explanatory mechanisms and boundary conditions of that relationship. Method: A sample of 240 medical providers from a hospital in China responded to three surveys over a four-month time frame. Results: Results showed that upward counterfactuals were positively related to supervisor ratings of safety compliance and participation. These relationships were mediated by safety knowledge but not by safety motivation. Upward counterfactuals were more strongly related to safety behavior and knowledge than downward counterfactuals. As expected, safety locus of control strengthened the mediating effects of safety knowledge on the relationship between upward counterfactuals and safety behavior. Conclusions and Practical Applications: The findings demonstrated that counterfactual thinking is positively associated with safety behavior and knowledge, thus expanding the variables related to workplace safety and laying some initial groundwork for new safety interventions incorporating counterfactual thinking.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,1

Journal of School Violence, 23(2), 165‚Äì186. https://doi.org/10.1080/15388220. 2023.2297033","The current study addresses two research questions regarding the relationship between strict and lenient school punishment practices on juvenile justice referrals between the border and non-border school locations, as well as the associated immigration and racial/ethnic disparities. First, do the relationships between school strictness and juvenile referrals differ at the border and non-border schools? The results do suggest that the relationship between school strictness and juvenile justice referrals indeed varies between the border and non-border schools. In general, it appears that border schools are relatively less strict and have lower rates of juvenile justice referrals; however, non-border schools have stricter school climates and higher rates of juvenile justice referrals. Second, does school strictness moderate the children of immigrants‚Äô juvenile justice referrals at the border and non-border schools? It is important to highlight that the children of immigrants at the border are attending schools with relatively more lenient school climates and are less likely to be referred to the juvenile justice system. The findings also clearly confirm prior studies (Ee & G√°ndara, 2020; Peguero & Bondy, 2021; Peguero et al., 2015; Verma et al., 2017; Wright & Rodriguez, 2014), which reported that the children of immigrants attend strict school climates and are disproportionally being referred to the juvenile justice system; but these disparities for the children of immigrants are predominately occurring in non-border schools. The following will be a deeper analytical discussion about school strictness and racial/ethnic and immigrant disparities as well as the implications, limitations, and future research associated with this study‚Äôs findings.

First, we examined the variability in the relationships between school strictness and juvenile justice referrals in Texas schools near the US-Mexico border in comparison to non-border Texas schools. Given the unique context of the US-Mexico border, earlier studies have suggested that schools near the border experience greater surveillance and law enforcement presence than non-border schools and therefore, are likely to have a higher proportion of juvenile justice referrals. Yet, we found that Texas schools near the border are less strict and have lower juvenile justice referral rates while non-border Texas schools are stricter and have higher juvenile justice referral rates in comparison. Therefore, the place is important in terms of the association between school strictness and juvenile justice referrals. On the one hand, our findings in non-border Texas schools support other studies, which indicate that strict school climates are associated with higher juvenile justice referral rates (Kupchik, 2010, 2016; Marchbanks et al., 2018; Peguero et al., 2018; Rios, 2011, 2017; Shedd, 2015; Varela et al., 2018; Welch & Payne, 2010, 2012). On the other hand, our findings in Texas schools near the US-Mexico border suggest something different. Some researchers have suggested that communities closer to the border may have a more lenient system in place due to its location (Dur√°n & Posadas, 2016). As illustrated in our findings, schools near the US-Mexico border generally have higher proportions of immigrant, Latino/a, and poor students and therefore, school administrators, who have a history of working with these students, may be better equipped at helping these students through other means than school disciplinary measures.

The second research question of this study asked whether school strictness moderated the children of immigrants‚Äô juvenile justice referrals at the border and non-border schools. A brief recap of the findings may help contextualize this discussion. In Model 1 both the border status of the school and the percentage of students that are second-generation immigrants are insignificantly related to the levels of juvenile justice contact. After controlling for school strictness (Model 2), second-generation immigrant students are associated with lower juvenile justice rates statewide. When the analyses are limited to border campuses but school strictness is not incorporated (Model 3), these results are inverted, and second-generation immigrant students are associated with a slight increase in juvenile justice contact. However, once school strictness is controlled for, second-generation immigrant students are no longer significant (Model 4). When the analyses are limited to non-border campuses but school strictness is not incorporated (Model 5), both first and second-generation students are associated with lower juvenile justice rates. These results remain consistent even after school strictness is incorporated (Model 6). Combined, these results suggest that second-generation immigrant students are associated with lower juvenile justice rates after controlling for school strictness at the state level and among non-border schools. School strictness moderated the association between second-generation immigration status and juvenile justice rates, for border schools, but not for non-border schools and statewide. However, this may be explained by the significance of the racial/ethnic categories. Previous scholarship has repeatedly noted the racialized rhetoric surrounding immigration discourse (Armenta, 2017; Peguero et al., 2018), particularly surveillance and punishment (Kirk et al., 2012; Ousey & Unnever, 2012; Zatz & Smith, 2017).

Our findings confirm prior research findings that more stringent school punishment practices have disproportionately punished students of color (Peguero, 2011; Peguero & Bondy, 2021; Peguero et al., 2018; Welch & Payne, 2010). In both the state-wide and non-border schools, Latino/a and Black/African American students were positively associated with juvenile justice contact, even after controlling for school strictness. However, this effect was not seen in analyses focused on border schools. This may reflect the racialized aspect of the criminal immigrant narrative (Pendergast et al., 2018), which may be less prevalent among individuals who live and work along border communities. Since features, such as physical features and language proficiency are more notable markers of minority status, including immigration status, it may be that immigration status is not as strong of a predictor due to existing punitive beliefs directed to members of minority groups (Peguero et al., 2021; Stewart et al., 2015).

Implications for policy
The findings from this study have important implications for criminal justice, school safety, and immigration policies. While the research on racial threat and school punishment focuses on the link between increases in the number of students of color and punishment practices, it is important to examine the association between immigration and school punishment given the local context. Schools have long been battleground sites for immigration discourse and punitive policies, from questioning whether undocumented students have the right to an education in Plyer v. Doe (1982) to Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeting undocumented parents dropping off their children (Kirksey & Sattin-Bajaj, 2021). Punitive school policies compound harm to students by marginalizing them and derailing them from making educational progress, having positive school experiences, and impacting their well-being. Rather than serving as a deterrent, these punitive measures can place students on the school-to-prison pipeline, which already affects a disproportionate number of students of color, and places youth in institutions that foster criminal behavior (Hughes et al., 2017; Peguero et al., 2018; Rios, 2011, 2017). Our findings reinforce previous findings demonstrating that students of color are disproportionately negatively affected by school strictness policies, and this may be accounting for the lack of significance in immigrants‚Äô juvenile justice contacts. However, given the known overlap in the racial/ethnic and immigration discourse, it is worth noting the disproportionate impact strict school policies may have on immigrant families. To implement school safety policies that do not negatively impact students of color and immigrant youth, educational institutions, and their communities need to engage in a discussion with students of color, the children of immigrants, and their families. Schools need to focus on developing school safety policies that meet the needs of their students, parents, and local community members and avoid overly punitive school policies, such as zero-tolerance policies, which are found to be ineffective, problematic, and discriminatory. Additionally, institutions must recognize the racialized discourse surrounding immigration and how these intersections may influence policies.

Furthermore, it is clear that context and/or place matters in terms of the relationship between immigration and school safety. Given that immigrants and their children are increasingly living in non-traditional immigrant destinations or in areas farther away from the US-Mexico border, some schools may not be equipped to properly support the children of immigrants within their schools. Prior research suggests that teachers and administrators who have a deeper knowledge and understanding of the challenges and barriers, often in community contexts where immigration is historical, the children of immigrants‚Äô educational experiences and outcomes are much improved (Kao et al., 2013), Peguero & Bondy, 2021; Valenzuela, 2017). In turn, implementing culturally relevant and responsive pedagogy and curriculum would not only improve the safety, but also improve educational outcomes, for all students. Moreover, non-border schools should develop school-wide or district-wide assessments to identify important gaps or hidden biases, which can impact student success and increase criminal justice contact (Free & Kri≈æ, 2022). In doing so, non-border schools should look to how border schools or schools located within traditional immigrant destinations address those gaps, whether they be academic or regarding punishment and criminal justice contact. However, in looking to address any identified gaps, non-border schools, like border schools, should focus on policies to address trauma children of immigrants attending these schools face. Research has demonstrated that the best way to ensure this is to develop policies with active engagement and input from families, students themselves, and trusted community members (Arora et al., 2021; Birman et al., 2007; Pumariega & Rothe, 2010).

Limitations and implications for future research
Future research should address some of the limitations of the current study. First, it is important to consider the importance of local context and place in studies on immigration and school punishment. While we provide evidence in support of research which indicates that youth of color are at a greater risk of being punished in schools, we find that context and place are significant. It is important to develop a better understanding of why some schools may be better equipped to work with children of immigrants than others given their history, the availability of resources, and local policies. For example, research has shown that local law enforcement policies vary from place to place with some communities actively engaging in the enforcement of immigration laws while other communities have threatened to impede these efforts by federal law enforcement (Martinez-Schuldt & Martinez, 2021). As a result, the experiences of immigrant youth and their families varies tremendously across space with some communities seeking to punish immigrants and their families while other are trying to assist them by offering them services that may help them buy homes, find jobs, and assimilate into their community. As immigrants began to move into new destinations that fall outside of the traditional immigrant destinations, it is important to examine whether some of the schools and communities in these new destinations are willing and able to address some of the challenges immigrant youth and their families face as they assimilate into their communities without turning to punishment.

Second, researchers should consider how the differences within the immigrant population may impact the relationship between school strictness and juvenile justice referrals. Although generally grouped as one category, there is a lot of variation across immigrants in the US in terms of generation (e.g., first-generation), immigration status (e.g., undocumented), country of origin (e.g., Mexico), and skin tone, which may have an impact on their experiences in school (Chou & Feagin, 2015; Feliciano, 2009; Feliciano & Lanuza, 2017). For example, recent reports indicate that most of the recent encounters with immigrants at the border came from countries other than Mexico (Gramlich & Scheller, 2021). While most migrants crossing the US-Mexico border have historically been from Mexico, a growing number of migrants have arrived from other countries, such as Ecuador, Brazil, and Nicaragua and the number of unaccompanied children has nearly tripled over the last decade. Based on these recent changes in migration patterns, it is important to examine whether schools are equipped to handle the youth of immigrants coming from other countries dealing with economic, social, and political instability while providing them with opportunities at schools and better future outcomes.

Third, earlier research indicates that the intersectionality between race/ethnicity and gender places certain youth at a greater disadvantage in schools (Kupchik, 2010, 2016; Rios, 2011, 2017). Previous studies have indicated that males, whether Black/African American or Latino/x, are more likely to be subject to harsher punishments than their white counterparts. They tend to be labeled as ‚Äúdeviants‚Äù and therefore, they are treated as if they had committed serious crimes by law enforcement officials even if they have only been arrested for minor drug possession or status offenses (Rios, 2011, 2017). Other studies have also found that females, whether Black/African American or Latina/x, are more likely to be punished for minor violations of school policies such as dress codes, which often result in school suspensions or expulsions due to their behavior perceived as ‚Äúloud‚Äù or ‚Äúdefiant‚Äù (Bettie, 2014; Crenshaw et al., 2015; Morris, 2016). Future studies should examine the intersection between race/ethnicity and gender as male and female students often undergo different experiences in school, which may also intersect with the students‚Äô generation, immigration status, country of origin, and/or skin tone. Because schools play a critical role in students‚Äô development, it is important to identify how schools may reduce the criminalization and punishment of students of color to improve their future outcomes.

Conclusion

Despite these limitations, our findings suggest that the social and political discourse at the border as violent, criminal, and dangerous does not apply to schools and safety. Our findings also show that border school climates are less strict while also having lower levels of juvenile justice referrals, including for the children of immigrants that attend these schools. Narratives of immigration, crime, and safety becoming increasingly heated, and the relationship between immigration, place (i.e., borders), safety, and juvenile justice deserves urgent and continued attention. The rapidly growing immigrant student population warrants providing needed services, as well as a safe school climate. Although research has demonstrated that the children of immigrants are less likely to engage in delinquency and school misbehavior (DiPietro et al., 2015; Kubrin & Desmond, 2017; Peguero & Bondy, 2021), some studies show that the children of immigrants are disproportionately punished in schools (Peguero et al., 2015, 2017). This study confirms and clarifies that those disproportionate rates of punishment and juvenile justice referrals for the children of immigrants are significant in non-border schools. Certainly: ensuring safe and healthy school climates for all students, particularly for the children of immigrants should be a priority in a democratic society such as the US, which was founded by immigrants.","Immigration disparities are associated with strict school climates and juvenile justice. Place also matters concerning school strictness and disproportionate minority contact for minority youth. What remains unknown is the relationship between school strictness, immigration, and punishment along the Texas-Mexico border. Drawing from the Texas Education Agency‚Äôs (TEA) Public Education Information Management System (PEIMS), we address two questions regarding the relationship between school strictness and juvenile justice referrals in border and non-border schools. First, do the relationships between school strictness and juvenile referrals differ between border and non-border schools? Second, does school strictness moderate the children of immigrants‚Äô juvenile justice referrals at border and non-border schools? Findings indicate border and non-border distinctions regarding both strict and lenient school disciplinary practices and the relationships with juvenile justice referrals. This study contributes to juvenile justice research by investigating potential links between school strictness, immigration, juvenile justice referrals, and place.","2",0,"2","Political",2,0

Military Psychology, 35(6), 552‚Äì565. https://doi.org/10.1080/08995605.2022.2139122","The purpose of this study was to test the association between DEI climate factors (i.e., negative workplace experiences, leadership climate, unit climate, and the military climate) and REHD in the U.S. Military. Identifying actionable DEI correlates of REHD is a foundational step toward pinpointing promising targets for efforts to prevent REHD, and ultimately for developing, testing, and deploying effective prevention and response strategies and policies moving forward.

Our findings extend the work by [Bergman et al. (2012)] and suggest that several DEI climate factors are associated with REHD experiences in the U.S. military. The top DEI climate factors associated with REHD included workplace hostility, supervisor attention to REHD, and military attention to REHD, though the relative importance of these factors differed for White members and Racial/Ethnic Minority members. Notably, our results also indicated that DEI climate factors were collectively more important than demographic characteristics in predicting REHD, making DEI factors prime targets for testing and developing interventions and policies to reduce REHD. Key DEI climate factors that emerged included leadership and military attention to REHD as well as workplace hostility.

Practical implications
Findings underscore the role military leaders play in reducing REHD in the U.S. military. Our results indicate that when members perceive that the military overall and their immediate supervisor pay too little attention to REHD, they are at increased odds of having experienced REHD themselves within the past 12 months. Consistent with previous findings ([Bergman et al., 2012; Larsen et al., 2013]), this suggests that the tone from leaders may be one of the most important, though not only, ways to decrease REHD. Ensuring that individual leaders and the military as a whole are firmly committed to eliminating REHD, including communicating this commitment effectively down to the Force in policy and practice may be a key to prevention, especially for Racial/Ethnic Minority members for whom this was the most important predictor. Thus, DoD efforts to increase leadership engagement and ensure leadership commitment to eradicating REHD are supported by this research. As more leaders communicate clear and unequivocal commitment to supporting DEI and reducing REHD, we should see REHD in the U.S. military decrease in the future.

In addition to support from leaders, our study illustrates the importance of combating workplace hostility as a means of reducing REHD. Prior research has found disrespectful treatment to be related to a variety of harmful and violent behaviors in the U.S. military including sexual harassment and sexual assault ([Breslin et al., 2020; Samuelson et al., 2021]). Thus, targeting workplace hostility (and fostering the inverse, civility) may not only prevent REHD, but may also prevent other relational problems observed in the U.S. military. To date, the U.S. military has not engaged in a robust strategy to prevent and address workplace hostility directly. This may change, however, with the introduction of a new integrated primary prevention policy published in 2020, which, for the first time, calls out the importance of addressing this lower-level problematic behavior in military units to prevent more serious behaviors (DoD, 2020d). In line with the policy, the new Defense Organizational Climate Survey (DECOS) 5.0, which serves to provide unit commanders with information on leading indicators of climate problems within their own units (such as REHD), includes a measure of workplace hostility ([Clare et al., 2021]). Commanders should use these results as a signal for risk of more serious problems in their unit and respond accordingly.

Limitations
While this study is one of the first to examine the association between various facets of DEI climate on experiences of REHD in the workplace, it is not without limitations. These results are based on individual models using cross-sectional data with a U.S. military population. Therefore, the findings are not causal and may not extend to other militaries or nonmilitary organizations. Additionally, the limitations of cross-sectional data preclude our ability to identify the directionality of findings. Thus, we are unable to say that DEI climate precedes REHD experiences or if experiencing REHD colors perceptions of DEI climate. As such, these findings should be interpreted as associations. Moreover, we were limited to the variables contained on the 2017 WEOA, though it is highly likely other DEI climate factors are related to REHD as well. Finally, our research should be replicated in other militaries and organizations as well and should leverage other research designs, described below.

Future directions
Future research should use longitudinal methods, such as repeated measures over time, to determine the temporal ordering of the associations among DEI climate and REHD. This will also be important to identify and disambiguate ratings of the DEI climate of an organization from an individual‚Äôs experiences of REHD (see Walsh et al., 2010 for an example), as this type of research can lend more credence to the claim that DEI climate factors within units are related to risk for REHD.

Even if the research described above more definitively establishes a link between DEI climate and REHD, it is critical that interventions intended to improve DEI climate (and/or ultimately prevent REHD) be developed, piloted, and evaluated according to best practices in program evaluation before being rolled out to the entire Force to ensure they work. Given mixed findings on the effectiveness of existing DEI interventions in the workplace ([Bezrukova et al., 2016]), there is significant work to be done to develop, test, and deploy effective approaches for reducing REHD in the U.S. Armed Forces.

Finally, researchers should continue to investigate other factors that contribute to REHD given the amount of variance left unexplained. In particular, several of the DEI climate factors examined were not associated with REHD in the presence of the other variables while certain demographic characteristics emerged as significant. This suggests there are additional factors at play that have yet to be discovered or some that could be explored more fully (e.g., paygrade) to paint a clearer picture of REHD in the U.S. military. Further, there are likely additional DEI indicators (Brown et al., 2020) not assessed on the 2017 WEOA that could be added to the survey in the future to better capture ""inclusive climates.""

Conclusion
This study sought to lay the groundwork for future interventions by identifying specific, actionable DEI factors associated with REHD in the U.S. military. Our findings add to a growing body of evidence that various aspects of DEI climate, such as leadership efforts and workplace hostility, are associated with the experience of REHD and may be promising targets for intervention and policy moving forward.","As one of the most racially/ethnically diverse workplaces in the United States, the Department of Defense (DoD) has been on the forefront in driving diversity initiatives. Yet, racial/ethnic harassment and discrimination (REHD) in the military persist and threaten mission readiness. Despite this, limited research exists identifying factors that influence REHD in the U.S. military that could be leveraged for prevention and intervention. In this study, we sought to identify how diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) factors in the workplace are associated with REHD in order to identify potential targets for prevention and policy efforts to improve racial/ethnic relations in the U.S. military. Using the 2017 Workplace and Equal Opportunity Survey of Active Duty Members, we found military, leadership, and unit DEI climate factors were the top predictors of REHD, though the relative importance of each predictor varied by racial/ethnic minority status. In particular, we found military and leadership attention to REHD to be the top predictors for Racial/Ethnic Minority active duty members whereas workplace hostility was the top predictor for non-Hispanic White active duty members. Implications for programs and policies surrounding REHD in the U.S. military are discussed.

Primary Care Physicians, State Governments, and COVID-19 Responsibility and Response. State Politics & Policy Quarterly, 24(2), 145‚Äì166. doi:10.1017/spq.2023.27","Federalism can create ‚Äúlaboratories of democracy,‚Äù encouraging policy innovation and diffusion (Karch 2007; Shipan and Volden 2006) or it can contribute to democratic backsliding, widening policy gaps across states and extending disparities in health, education, and life expectancy (Grumbach 2018). While this is true across policy areas, perhaps nowhere are the challenges of federalism and disparate policy responses more visibly evident than during the COVID-19 pandemic. An uncoordinated federal response by the Trump Administration left states to largely fend for themselves, and left governors in charge of many aspects of the pandemic response (Bowman and McKenzie 2020). State-level responses to the pandemic were unfortunately often driven more by partisan political considerations rather than the best available data (Birkland et al. 2021; Jacobs 2021; Kettl 2020; Knauer 2020). Outcomes, predictably, varied as well.

In this paper, we asked how physicians evaluated state-level responses, including who they believed should be responsible for managing the pandemic, how much trust they had in the state for handling COVID-19, their evaluations of state-level restrictions on businesses and individuals, and their evaluations of how well the state did in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. In an ideal world, physicians would not respond to partisanship. If there is a single conclusion from these analyses, however, it is this: Physicians are not immune to state politics. Physician partisan affiliation mattered a great deal in terms of whether a physician thought the state should be more (or less) responsible, how much trust they placed in the state for handling the crisis, whether they believed state-level restrictions were ‚Äúnot enough,‚Äù and whether they thought the state was doing a good job responding to the pandemic. In short, Republican physicians were less likely to believe the state was responsible, less trusting of state government and the state‚Äôs governor, more likely to believe there were too many (rather than not enough) restrictions on businesses and individuals, and less likely to believe the state was doing a good job.

Just how partisan are physicians? For purposes of comparison, in an AP-NORC poll general population survey conducted in May 2020, 76% of Democrats in states with a Democratic governor approved of their state government‚Äôs performance during the pandemic compared to 37% of Republicans. In states with a Republican governor, in contrast, 41% of Democrats approved compared to 65% of Republicans. Overall, physicians appear to be polarized in their responses, but do not appear to be as polarized as the general public. Similarly, in the 2020 pre-election ANES 2020 survey, in states with a Democratic governor, 87% approved of their governor‚Äôs performance compared to 33% of Republicans. In states with a Republican governor, 38% of Democrats approved of their governor‚Äôs performance compared to 75% of Republicans.

Partisan politics, however, is not the end of the story. Politics was most evident in physician trust in state government, trust in the state‚Äôs governor, and evaluations of whether the state was doing a good job. In this respect, Democratic physicians were more likely to trust state government, trust the governor, and believe the state was doing a good job when a Democrat was governor. The partisan effects for Republican physicians in states controlled by Republican governors, however, were less clearly partisan. In states with Republican governors, Republican physicians reported less trust in state government and in the governor, and they were less positive in their evaluations of state efforts to combat the pandemic. In addition, the number of COVID-19 cases was an important predictor of how physicians evaluated state-level restrictions on individuals and businesses. In states with higher case counts, physicians were more likely to believe there were not enough restrictions. Overall, politics matters, but so too does the reality of the pandemic. Perhaps more to the point, partisanship influences physicians in their evaluations of state policy, but the strength of the association is contingent on the state political and policy contexts.

We would be remiss if we did not conclude by noting the limitations of our study. Our results were based on a nonprobability sample and a relatively small sample (N=625). While our sample compares favorably to available benchmarks, we cannot conclude with certainty that our results are representative of the population of PCPs. Moreover, in making comparisons to the general population, any differences may reflect sampling differences rather than differences in physicians versus the general public. One question we were unable to address is how physicians balance their professional identity against their partisan affiliation. We suspect that physicians with a stronger sense of professional identity would depart more readily from their prior partisan commitments. Investigating this question will, unfortunately, have to be the subject of future research.","Emerging health crises challenge and overwhelm federal political systems (Greer et al. 2020, Global Public Health 15: 1413‚Äì6). Within the context of COVID-19, states and governors took charge in the absence of a coordinated federal response. The result was uneven policy responses and variance in health-related and economic outcomes. While existing research has explored public evaluations of state COVID-19 policies, we explore primary care physicians‚Äô trust in state government for handling the pandemic, as well as their evaluations of their state government‚Äôs treatment responsibility for the pandemic and their state‚Äôs policy response. We find that general preferences for the role of the federal/state government in addressing the pandemic are shaped by individual-level physician partisanship. Specific evaluations of state policy responsiveness are influenced by whether physicians‚Äô partisan preferences matched their governor. We also find, however, that Republican physicians were critical of Republican governors and physicians were less partisan than the general public. At least within public health, there are limits to the influence of partisan identity on expert (physician) political evaluations.","1",0,"1","Political",4,0

We chose to probe people's attitudes about the sources of individual differences in intelligence because of the centrality of the belief in human improvement in liberal and left-wing thought (Porter, 2013; Rattan et al., 2012). Across both studies, our results provide little evidence that this belief impairs people's recognition that intelligence is, at least in part, heritable. In Study 1, we found no association between religiosity or free-market attitudes, two powerful proxies for conservatism, and people's belief that intelligence is shaped by the environment rather than genetics. In Study 2, the zero-order correlation between conservatism and heritability was positive and significant (implying that liberals were less likely to endorse heritability of intelligence) but when other variables were controlled in the predictive model, this relationship disappeared.

Our results mesh well with a recent survey of sociologists, a discipline that has been cited as being particularly ‚Äúleft-wing‚Äù (Winegard & Winegard, 2017), which found that more than 80% of respondents endorsed a role of genetics in determining people's intellectual potential (Horowitz, Yaworsky, & Kickham, 2014). This clear endorsement of heritability among people seen as predominantly ‚Äúleft-wing‚Äù is not compatible with the suspicion that this particular scientific evidence might be dismissed in favor of ideology among people on the left. The only hint in our data that people on the left might be more inclined to think that intelligence can be shaped by the environment arises from the positive association between nationalism (Study 1) or SDO (Study 2) and heritability. Both nationalism and SDO are less prevalent on the left than the political right, although both only tap a subset of the liberal-conservatism spectrum.

Our findings thus add to the catalogue of unsuccessful attempts to find strong evidence for science denial on the political left in attitudinal surveys. Although there has been some media speculation that people on the left are unreasonably skeptical of genetically-modified (GM) foods (Kloor, 2012; Shermer, 2013) or vaccinations (Mooney, 2011), those speculations have failed to find much empirical support to date. Although in a regional survey liberals appear to be more wary of GM foods by supporting legislation requiring labeling (Hamilton, 2014), they also trust scientists more on questions relating to GM than conservatives (Hamilton, 2015). In a nationally representative survey in the U.S., neither conservatism nor free-market endorsement predicted attitudes towards GM foods (e.g., Lewandowsky et al., 2013). In another recent analysis of U.S. responses to the International Social Survey Program, Rutjens et al. (2018) found a small but significant effect of conservatism (Œ≤= -.08), indicating that conservatives were less skeptical of GM. Across three studies, Rutjens et al. (2018) nonetheless conclude that ‚ÄúGM food skepticism is not driven by political or religious beliefs‚Äù (p. 395).

Concerning vaccinations, Hamilton, Hartter, and Saito (2015) showed that trust in scientists regarding vaccinations was greater among Democrats than Republicans, and Kahan et al. (2010) showed that conservatives' opposition to vaccination was particularly acute in the context of sexually transmitted diseases such as the human-papillomavirus (HPV) responsible for cervical cancer. Similarly, free-market endorsement has repeatedly been shown to be a predictor of rejection of vaccinations (Lewandowsky et al., 2013, Lewandowsky et al., 2020, and the present Study 1). Intriguingly, when conservatism is considered separately from free-market endorsement, it is not associated with attitudes towards vaccinations (Model 2 in Lewandowsky et al., 2013; Lewandowsky et al., 2020, and the present Study 2, although the present measure of conservatism included one free-market item). The available data thus suggest that it is libertarianism, rather than socio-political conservatism, that makes people reluctant to endorse vaccinations, perhaps because the issue is overshadowed by potential government interference (e.g., by making vaccinations mandatory). Either way, the conjecture that vaccinations are primarily rejected by people on the political left finds no support in the data (see also, Hornsey et al., 2018).

5.2. Worldviews and the norms of science
The broad range of results showing conservatives to be more likely to reject scientific findings than liberals motivated our question whether there is anything about the scientific enterprise itself that may challenge people with rightwing or libertarian worldviews. We were particularly concerned with the universalist and communist norms of science (Merton, 1942); namely, that science transcends racial, class, and national barriers and that its findings belong to the community as a whole. Those norms stand in obvious opposition to streams of conservative thought, and in support our first study confirmed that nationalism was a predictor of the rejection of well-established scientific findings relating to climate change and vaccinations.

Our second study extended this using a more direct and broader test of people's attitudes towards the norms of science. Endorsement of the norms of science was a positive predictor of acceptance of climate science and vaccinations, and it was negatively associated with conservatism and SDO.

Taken together, the results of our two studies provide a potential explanation for why conservatives are more likely to reject scientific findings than liberals. Previous accounts have focused on the ideologically asymmetrical challenge posed by current scientifically-based problems (Kahan, 2015; Lewandowsky & Oberauer, 2016). On that account, conservatives reject climate science not because they reject science per se but because climate mitigation requires changes to current economic practice.

Our findings show that this view is, at best, incomplete. In addition to the obvious clash between conservative views and specific scientific results, we have identified a general tension between conservative thought and the norms of science (bearing in mind the exception for skepticism; see Table 5). The pervasive rejection of science by people on the right observed here and in many other studies is thus not just coincidental or dictated by political pragmatics, but also represents a deep conflict between science and conservatism.

5.3. Attitudinal asymmetry and potential cognitive symmetry
The finding that science denial primarily‚Äîor indeed exclusively‚Äîinvolves the political right meshes well with reports of greater gullibility and receptivity to false information among people on the political right. For example, Sterling, Jost, and Pennycook (2016) found that individuals who endorsed a neoliberal, free market ideology were more susceptible to what they called ‚Äúpseudo-profound bullshit;‚Äù that is, vague or meaningless statements composed of intellectual lingo such as ‚Äúconsciousness is the growth of coherence, and of us.‚Äù Similar findings were reported by Pfattheicher and Schindler (2016). This asymmetrical theme is also revealed in recent ‚Äúbig-data‚Äù analyses, which have reported evidence of substantial selective exposure to fake news, with Trump supporters consuming more news from untrustworthy websites than others (Guess, Nyhan, & Reifler, 2020). Similarly, a recent large-scale study of Twitter users has found that sharing of misinformation was disproportionately concentrated among older Republicans (Grinberg, Joseph, Friedland, Swire-Thompson, & Lazer, 2019). Perhaps unsurprisingly, rejection of science, endorsement of pseudo-profound but meaningless statements, and susceptibility to ‚Äúfake news‚Äù may turn out to be diverse sides of the same political coin.

In striking contrast to those reports of asymmetry, laboratory experiments have repeatedly shown that the propensity to engage in cognitive shortcuts‚Äîthat is, responding on the basis of superficial association rather than deep reflection‚Äîis distributed evenly across the political divide. When participants are presented with synthetic data (e.g., hypothetical results of gun control laws) that are amenable to a quick‚Äîbut inaccurate‚Äîinterpretation, as well as to a competing complex‚Äîand accurate‚Äîinterpretation, the quick but inaccurate interpretation is triggered when it is worldview congruent, irrespective of the person's beliefs. Conversely, the more complex and accurate reading of the data is recruited only when the quick interpretation challenges participants' worldview, and this effect also holds irrespective of a person's beliefs (Kahan, Peters, Dawson, & Slovic, 2013; Washburn & Skitka, 2018). These data suggest that when people are asked to engage in cognitive processing to interpret data in the laboratory, as opposed to expressing their pre-existing attitudes in a survey, then conservatives and liberals engage seemingly identical cognitive processes. Similar nearly-symmetrical processing of corrections to misinformation has been reported by Swire-Thompson, Ecker, Lewandowsky, & Berinsky (2020) with Trump voters and Sanders voters.‚Å∂

We are thus presented with a puzzle: if people across the political spectrum can engage the same cognitive processes to interpret numeric data or process corrections in the laboratory, how can they differ so reliably and asymmetrically in their attitudes towards a broad range of scientific findings? The present results suggest that the resolution of the puzzle may lie in the tension between the norms that govern the scientific enterprise and conservative political thought. Conservatives are less likely to endorse the norms of science, and therefore are more inclined to distrust scientific results in general. This general propensity to distrust science is tapped in surveys that ask about a person's pre-existing view about scientific findings on a broad topic such as climate change or vaccinations. Those views, in turn, have likely been formed over time based on information from the media, friends and family, community leaders, and other public sources that a person finds credible. On each of those occasions, there is an opportunity to consider that testimony through the lens of the norms of science. By contrast, in laboratory experiments where people are asked to draw their own conclusions from specific data, it appears that the propensity to distrust science is not activated by the task at hand. This account is necessarily speculative but it gives rise to several interesting empirical questions about the relationship between the two paradigms that can be explored in future research, such as whether explicit reminders about the norms of science would affect subsequent interpretation of the data, or conversely, whether partisan differences in attitudes might become attenuated by prior processing of data.","Some scientific propositions are so well established that they are no longer debated by the relevant scientific community, such as the fact that greenhouse gas emissions are altering the Earth's climate. In many cases, such scientifically settled issues are nonetheless rejected by segments of the public. U.S. surveys have repeatedly shown that the rejection of scientific evidence across a broad range of domains is preferentially associated with rightwing or libertarian worldviews, with little evidence for rejection of scientific evidence by people on the political left. We report two preregistered representative surveys (each N>1000) that (1) sought to explain this apparent political asymmetry and (2) continued the search for the rejection of scientific evidence on the political left. To address the first question, we focused on Merton's classic analysis of the norms of science, such as communism and universalism, which continue to be internalized by the scientific community but which are not readily reconciled with conservative values. Both studies show that people's political worldviews are associated with their attitudes towards those scientific norms, and that those attitudes predict people's acceptance of vaccinations and climate science. The norms of science may thus be in latent conflict with the worldviews of a substantial segment of the public. To address the second question, we examined people's views on the role of inheritance in determining people's intelligence, given that the belief in the power of learning and environmental factors to shape human development is a guiding principle of leftwing thought. We find no association between core measures of political worldviews and people's view of heritability of intelligence, although two subordinate constructs, nationalism and social dominance orientation, were associated with belief in heritability.","1",0,"1","Political",2,0
202,63,"Cislak, A., Formanowicz, M., & Saguy, T. (2018). Bias against research on gender bias. Scientometrics, 115, 189-200. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-018-2667-0","Articles on gender discrimination were funded less often and published in less prestigious journals than papers on racial discrimination. Considering that the percentage of women in the author pool had a virtually null effect on both grant acquisition and the Impact Factor, this effect cannot be explained in terms of the gender of the researchers. So, what are the possible causes of this effect? Although we controlled for the type of methods used in the studies in the analysis, we cannot rule out the possibility that the articles on gender bias were of a different quality than the articles on race bias. This is, however, unlikely for the following reasons. First, as mentioned before, both gender and race bias are investigated within the same fields using similar methods and paradigms. It is rather unlikely that researchers who deal with gender research are less experienced or were trained in worse schools than researchers on race bias. Even less likely is that they used flawed methodology on purpose. Moreover, all the analyzed articles passed peer-review screening, which is considered a quality watchdog within the scientific community. Finally, the Impact Factor index is not a measure of the quality of individual research articles. As indicated in the San Francisco Declaration of Assessment of Research, it shall not be used as such, nor to assess individual scientists‚Äô contributions or in hiring, promotion, or funding decisions. The Impact Factor was introduced to help librarians make decisions about popular journals within the field (Garfield 1996). All of the above suggest that bias against research on gender bias is not merit based but a reflection of a topic‚Äôs lower prestige and appreciation due to a generalized gender bias (as outlined in the introduction). Another potential alternative explanation for the observed differences in grant funding for racial and gender bias research is the relative difference in the availability of participant samples. Recruiting racially diverse samples may be more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, while recruiting gender-diverse samples may be less of a problem, thereby necessitating less funding for recruitment. Future research should probe whether researchers studying gender bias are less eager to apply for funding or the gender bias applications are less likely to be funded, mirroring the effect of a female grant authorship (Ley and Hamilton 2008). It seems less plausible, though, that the availability of participant samples may affect the teams‚Äô decisions regarding the outlet for their work. Admittedly, the current bibliometric analysis does not allow for the determination of whether the research programs on gender bias are submitted to (and, as a consequence, also published by) less prestigious journals or are rejected by more prestigious journals. If the first explanation is correct, it either implies that researchers are aware of the existence of bias against gender bias research among academic community or that they consider their own work less suitable for more prestigious journals, thus perpetuating the existing arrangements. The second mechanism‚Äîthe rejection by more prestigious journals‚Äîwould be in line with previous research on the existence of subtle bias in the perceived quality of studies evidencing gender discrimination (Handley et al. 2015). Given that abstracts on gender bias research were evaluated less positively by male reviewers (Handley, et al. 2015), one possible explanation for the obtained result is that the research on gender bias is more often reviewed by male researchers than research on race bias. With the available dataset, we cannot rule out that possibility. However, considering that the pool of reviewers, due to common editorial strategies, is likely to be similar to the author pool (for gender research, comprising 66% women, and for race research, 56% women) this seems rather unlikely. Nevertheless, future research could examine whether the type of discrimination (gender versus race) is sent to reviewers of different genders and whether this relationship varies by the journal‚Äôs prestige.ImplicationsThe reported bias is a potentially powerful phenomenon because it might be invisible to the scientific community and, as such, overlooked (Blair et al. 2004; Carnes et al. 2012; Devine et al. 2017) and not taken care of (in contrast to the first and second types of bias mentioned in the introduction, for which corrective measures have been applied). By raising the awareness of the existence of bias against research on gender bias among male researchers (Handley et al. 2015) and in general as a topic of scientific inquiry, as in our study, we hope to contribute to the discussion about the fairness of journal policies. This discussion is primarily important in order for gender bias to be properly acknowledged within the scientific community and to pursue further examination of this powerful source of inequality that severely affects many women in the world (UN Women 2015). Gender bias intersects with social standing, resulting in a feminization of poverty (Starrels et al. 1994). In addition, it intersects with race bias in academic communities (Gutie¬¥rrez y Muhs et al. 2012; Hopkins et al. 2013) and elsewhere (Livingston et al. 2012; United Nations Division for the Advancement of Women [DAW], Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights [OHCHR], United Nations Development Fund for Women [UNIFEM] 2000). Finally, addressing this meta-bias within academia will strengthen the scientific community and its ability to expose and overcome bias and to maintain its powerful ability to inform organizational, national-level, and international policies and decision-making processes.","The bias against women in academia is a documented phenomenon that has had detrimental consequences, not only for women, but also for the quality of science. First, gender bias in academia affects female scientists, resulting in their underrepresentation in academic institutions, particularly in higher ranks. The second type of gender bias in science relates to some findings applying only to male participants, which produces biased knowledge. Here, we identify a third potentially powerful source of gender bias in academia: the bias against research on gender bias. In a bibliometric investigation covering a broad range of social sciences, we analyzed published articles on gender bias and race bias and established that articles on gender bias are funded less often and published in journals with a lower Impact Factor than articles on comparable instances of social discrimination. This result suggests the possibility of an underappreciation of the phenomenon of gender bias and related research within the academic community. Addressing this meta-bias is crucial for the further examination of gender inequality, which severely affects many women across the world.","3",0,"3","Political",2,0

Stress and worry in the 2020 coronavirus pandemic: Relationships to trust and compliance with preventive measures across 48 countries in the COVIDiSTRESS global survey. Royal Society Open Science, 8(2), 200589. https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.200589","Employing data from participants in 48 countries, we explored early psychological and behavioural responses to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, and how differences in psychological and behavioural responses influenced reactions to government efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus and associated COVID-19 disease. There are five major findings discussed in turn.First, the results revealed that there were marked differences between countries in the early months of the global COVID-19 crisis. Participants from Western European nations were more concerned over COVID-19, more stressed and had lower levels of trust in the government's efforts, compared with participants from other parts of the world. In their research comparing countries in Europe, Asia and North America, Dryhurst et al. [96] found that levels of risk perception were high among all countries for the period between March and April, with the highest levels being reported in the UK and Spain. In terms of compliance with local behavioural guidelines to slow the spread of coronavirus, there was no clear distinction in the geographical pattern in our data, with the exception of Japanese participants who reported particularly high levels of compliance (figure 4). In line with existing research showing cross-country differences in psychological responses to pandemics (e.g. [52,53,54]), the COVIDiSTRESS global survey finds that this was indeed also the case for early psychological responses to COVID-19. Our findings contribute to the research undertaken by other cross-country surveys highlighting the importance of the psychological underpinnings of public responses to the pandemic (e.g. Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication; [96]).Second, we found that concern over the coronavirus was positively associated with stress. The more concerned people were, the more stress they experienced. While this relationship between concern and stress seems to be a general pattern during pandemics (e.g. [22,24]), there were notable differences between countries, and concerns about the coronavirus itself did not account for all of the variances in experienced stress during the early months of coronavirus restrictions. As such, we found that while concern about the disease itself was a source of mental distress and perceived pressure, other factors including, for example, working conditions and children's education during lockdown must also be taken into consideration to fully understand the psychological impact of COVID-19 [97]. Our findings add to the existing findings from studies that have highlighted the negative economic impact of the pandemic and its association with anxiety or depression [98], as well as the overall negative psychological effects of the pandemic on parents [99].Third, we found that the more stressed people felt, the less compliant they were with behavioural guidelines; but also that more concerned individuals tended to display more behavioural compliance. These associations between compliance with local behavioural guidelines, and the psychological factors of perceived stress and concern, respectively, differed across countries. Again, the early COVID-19 period conformed to previous research showing that perceived stress and concern over a pandemic related to people's compliance (e.g. [17‚Äì19,31‚Äì33]). However, our analyses also contribute further, by providing a detailed cross-country comparison for relationships between early psychological and behavioural responses. While the full breadth of between-country differences is too numerous to discuss, interested readers can study these comparisons in figures 1‚Äì4. Specific country-level information can also be found in the electronic supplementary material and online datasets (https://osf.io/z39us/ and [59]).Fourth, the results showed that the more trust people had in government efforts to slow the spread of coronavirus, the less stress they experienced. Again, cross-country differences could be rooted in a number of factors ranging from differences in local cultures and political history, to variations in behavioural guidelines, government intervention stringency and the impact of COVID-19 at the time. Contrary to the relationship between trust in government efforts and perceived stress, we did not find support for the hypothesis that trust in government efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus would be negatively correlated with concern over the coronavirus. It would have seemed intuitive that trusting that appropriate measures were being taken by authorities would lessen concern. Instead, our results revealed considerable variation in associations between trust in government efforts and concern across different countries. In an effort to examine why this could be the case, we conducted additional exploratory analyses. Here, we found a significant positive interaction effect of the individual-level trust in government with the country-level Oxford Government Response Stringency Index. The emerging patterns indicate that the relationship between trust and concern became positive only in countries where the measures were objectively strict in comparison with other countries. In other words, most people were concerned over the early COVID-19 situation, but this perception was accompanied by trust in governmental measures only if such measures were relatively strict.There could be multiple explanations for this exploratory finding. Strict measures may instil a belief that all possible courses of action are being employed to alleviate the situation. We also know from H2 that stress is negatively associated with compliance‚Äîbut given our findings from H3, namely the negative correlation between perceived stress and trust in government efforts, it could be that better government intervention reduces stress along with the perceived need for compliance, if things seem well in hand. Further, it is plausible that governments will be more likely to implement stronger measures when they perceive a mandate from the populace combined with great concern. Factors like cohesion within society and the ability of each country to withstand downstream economic consequences will probably also play a role in this dynamic. Casualties could thus run in multiple directions, and are likely to interact. Research on the lockdowns implemented in Western Europe in March and April concurrently found an association between lockdowns and greater trust in government, political support for the governing party, and democratic satisfaction [94], suggesting that lockdowns are indeed generally popular among citizens in well-functioning democracies and may feel reassuring to citizens concerned over the progression of the disease; similar effects on trust were also observed in New Zealand [2]. However, countries in which less stringent lockdowns are applied may have experienced a reverse effect, where those most likely to be satisfied by a light government response may also be those who are least concerned with COVID-19 to begin with. Along these lines, a recent cross-country study by Fetzer et al. [100] found that timely and stringent government measures were associated with better mental well-being among citizens, while negative evaluations of the government's response to the pandemic were related to lower mental well-being and a lack of trust in government efforts to tackle the pandemic. Another analysis of mobility in European countries during the early weeks of the pandemic revealed gaps in compliance between populations that had high or low political trust as the stringency of lockdown increased [95], perhaps in part due to varying concern levels, as we also found support for in H2b.Fifth, greater availability of social support moderated the negative association between stress and compliance. Among people with higher levels of social support, stress was associated with less compliance with local preventive measures, while among people with lower levels of social support, stress was associated with more compliance. These outcomes run counter to our initial hypotheses, which might suggest that complying with society-level preventive measures was an especially attractive coping strategy for individuals who did not have the luxury of being looked out for by friends, family and neighbours. It might also be that those placing more stock in near relations for coping underestimated the importance and legitimacy of country-level restrictions. There might be several reasons why the evidence contradicted H5. Chang & Sivam [101] reported that the perceived stress and SARS-related fears were positively associated with preventive behaviours among Singaporians during the SARS outbreak. Similarly, Tang et al.'s [102] study showed that the perceived stress positively predicted the tendency of social distancing in early 2020 among participants in China and Hong Kong, places where the COVID-19 was more severe compared with other countries during the period. These previous studies would suggest that people tend to adopt behavioural measures to prevent the spread of the virus if they experience significant stress at the epicentres of pandemics, but our findings add the nuance that the psychological buffering role of social support may actually counteract the role of stress as a driver of cautious behaviour in the public sphere. Rather than looking at this phenomenon as a function of individual stress levels, this buffering mechanism could come into play when groups oppose government restrictions for political or practical reasons, or when younger adults converge on the need to retain their social life in the face of pandemic curfews.A notable limitation of the present study was the sampling method. While other studies (e.g. [3]) have collected survey data using paid representative respondent pools, the goal of the COVIDiSTRESS collaboration was to collect data as quickly and conveniently as possible, with researchers in each country deciding their own recruitment strategies. As such, although spanning across a large number of countries, our sample is not representative of the various national populations. For instance, the COVIDiSTRESS dataset has more female respondents, and, presumably due to the use of online media for recruitment, a younger demographic. Full dataset details can be found in the electronic supplementary material, and on the Open Science Framework.12.1. Practical implicationsThe present analysis of the COVIDiSTRESS dataset contributes to an understanding of the complexities at play in early psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings lead us to suggest several implications for practitioners such as health communicators, government officials and policy makers. Foremost, we find that although there are general patterns, between-countries differences in reactions to the crisis and compliance with behavioural guidelines show that interventions should be context sensitive. The actions already taken by governments, as well as the stress and stressors pervading a society, can at any given time lead to very different reactions to the same disease, the same restrictions, or the same recommendations from health or government authorities.Lowering stress in the population may be needed to create optimal conditions for compliance with behavioural guidelines. Establishing trust in government efforts by taking decisive and visible action, and addressing stressful issues such as childcare, lockdown predictability or job security during a pandemic, may for instance lead to better compliance by way of lessening the stresses experienced by individuals. However, care must be taken not to lessen concerns over the gravity of the health situation at the same time, as our data suggest that lessened personal concern over the virus, or reliance on close relations rather than collective societal action to handle everyday challenges, can run counter to accepting the need for protective behaviours in society at large. Taken together, this implies that governments should be as transparent and objective as possible in providing guidelines and updates of the most current situation in terms of the number of positive and recovered cases as well as deaths. Initial downplaying or hiding actual numbers of positive cases or deaths can have detrimental effects on public health as well as on institutional trust and levels of compliance as the pandemic surges. In addition, clarity in communicating governmental guidelines to reduce transmission has also the potential to alleviate perceived stress.Interventions to foster compliance with behavioural guidelines can thus be made more effective in their content and targeting, when based on knowledge of the target groups' current and baseline level of perceived stress, concern over COVID-19 and trust in government efforts. These three psychological constructs are antecedents of compliance with behavioural guidelines to slow the spread of COVID-19 and vary considerably between different countries. As shown, however, the relationship between these constructs is quite complex and varies according to numerous local factors, including the stringency of government interventions in each country, and tracking their relationship over time, and in different locales and social groups, could thus be an important tool for continuously adapting social, psychological and communicative strategies when responding to global pandemics. Further, in order to successfully communicate and implement protective behavioural measures, it appears important to base messages and channels on whether individuals in a target audience are oriented towards the measures in society more broadly, or the personal support of social groups, where the latter may reduce stress and compliance both (i.e. [103]).Even though general trends can be detected across the globe, we found notable between-countries variations in all our analyses. With a dataset comparing so many countries, it is infeasible to unpack all of these specific differences in the text properly. Instead, these must be considered individually though scrutiny of the graphs and electronic supplementary material, and possibly explained by future dives into the large open data pool combined with other sources of information. For instance, the timeframe for outbreaks has varied greatly across the planet, as has the capacity of health systems to treat the seriously afflicted, and measures to curtail the spread of the coronavirus. Also, while the behavioural guidelines of some governments and health authorities were presented as mere recommendations, other countries, regions and cities enforced strict closing of businesses, schools and public spaces, as well as curfews enforced by local police and military personnel. Communication and execution of these guidelines have also changed over time, and as many such guidelines may have shifted from being perceived as temporary emergency measures to a longer term ‚Äònew normal' by summer 2020 [103], psychological responses to the same measures may shift in turn. Further, factors like cultural norms, distribution of wealth, living conditions, proximity to neighbours, typical work life and trust in authorities all varied before the pandemic in myriad ways, which must be taken into account when interpreting the difference between any two countries as they emerge in the results from H1a to H1d (figures 1‚Äì4). For this reason, we invite detailed scrutiny and discussion of any interesting between-country differences using the open science online resources made available as code, data, electronic supplementary material and dynamic visualizations [59].12.2. Further researchAfter-effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are to be expected, and just as the emergence of the global pandemic presented new personal and societal challenges, re-opening and getting ‚Äòback to normal' will vary according to how each country opts to face these challenges [103]. As such, follow-up data collection will be important to assess the whole of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as how attitudes and psychological reactions changed from 2020 and into the coming years. Conducting a further and deeper between-countries analysis taking into account the preventive and communicative strategies employed by each government, as well as the seriousness of the various consequences from the medical to the economic spheres is thus necessary to understand the effects of the pandemic more broadly, over time. We have included the stringency of intervention in the post hoc work of the present pre-registered analysis, but many more such variables must be considered in the future.Finally, we believe that it is important to discuss the broad scientific climate of which the COVIDiSTRESS global survey is only a small part. As the global pandemic gained speed, researchers from a plethora of fields felt compelled to send out a barrage of surveys on issues ranging from conspiracy theories about the disease to experiences of parenting and working/learning from home. Indeed, multiple repositories and consortia also cropped up to support collaboration and avoid repetitive research questions in favour of a coordinated global undertaking. While these many research initiatives are bound to vary in quality, and contents will overlap, the period was an amazing example of the scientific community coming together to address a global crisis, and it is likely that the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdowns that ensued will be the most well-studied social event in human history from a perspective of real-time data collection. As such, future reviews and meta-analyses taking measures, sampling and overall study quality into account will lend a much deeper understanding. As a consortium, we believe that especially studies using the open data, pre-registration and publishing in the registered reports format will be decisive in the post-COVID-19 discussion of scientific quality and integrity during global crises. As the surge of new cases during the winter of 2020‚Äì2021 demonstrated, the pandemic had the potential to create lasting consequences beyond the measures implemented in the spring of 2020 and their after-effects. As such, longitudinal studies tracing the impact of protective measures on mental health would be particularly welcome. In a similar vein, it would be equally important to differentiate how infected versus uninfected individuals are influenced by the pandemic and related measures to contain it. Emerging research shows that individuals who recover continue to experience increased levels of anxiety, worry and poorer mental health [104]. Thus, future research must focus on comparative studies that investigate coping and stress-related maladaptive strategies and psychological recovery across infected and uninfected populations.","The COVIDiSTRESS global survey collects data on early human responses to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic from 173 429 respondents in 48 countries. The open science study was co-designed by an international consortium of researchers to investigate how psychological responses differ across countries and cultures, and how this has impacted behaviour, coping and trust in government efforts to slow the spread of the virus. Starting in March 2020, COVIDiSTRESS leveraged the convenience of unpaid online recruitment to generate public data. The objective of the present analysis is to understand relationships between psychological responses in the early months of global coronavirus restrictions and help understand how different government measures succeed or fail in changing public behaviour. There were variations between and within countries. Although Western Europeans registered as more concerned over COVID-19, more stressed, and having slightly more trust in the governments' efforts, there was no clear geographical pattern in compliance with behavioural measures. Detailed plots illustrating between-countries differences are provided. Using both traditional and Bayesian analyses, we found that individuals who worried about getting sick worked harder to protect themselves and others. However, concern about the coronavirus itself did not account for all of the variances in experienced stress during the early months of COVID-19 restrictions. More alarmingly, such stress was associated with less compliance. Further, those most concerned over the coronavirus trusted in government measures primarily where policies were strict. While concern over a disease is a source of mental distress, other factors including strictness of protective measures, social support and personal lockdown conditions must also be taken into consideration to fully appreciate the psychological impact of COVID-19 and to understand why some people fail to follow behavioural guidelines intended to protect themselves and others from infection.

Cross-Cultural Research, 46(2), 91-108. https://doi.org/10.1177/1069397111423898","This study explored the links among cultural values and national-level innovation ratings. Previous research has linked Hofstede‚Äôs cultural values with innovation outcomes‚Äîspecifically trademarks and patents. This study extends the relationship between Hofstede‚Äôs cultural values and innovation by looking at the relationship between Hofstede‚Äôs dimensions and a more comprehensive measure of national innovation‚Äîthe GII. Our research offers mixed support for Shane‚Äôs (1992, 1993) findings.The results of our analysis indicate that the cultural dimension of power distance is strongly and negatively related to innovation in line with Shane‚Äôs (1992, 1993) findings. High power distance nations may find it hard to encourage their citizens to innovate as inequalities among people are not only expected but desired and communication is limited between those of different strata (Hofstede, 2010). In high power distance nations subordinates in a workplace expect to be told what to do, thus, opportunities to think for oneself and to use imagination are limited. By contrast, subordinates in low power distance nations expect to be consulted and having imagination is prized (Hofstede, 2010). In low power distance nations, it is believed that all people should have equal rights and equal opportunities to succeed (Hofstede, 2010). In high power distance nations, it is believed that the powerful should have special privileges and it is expected that not everyone will have an equal opportunity to reach the highest level of advancement (Hofstede, 2010). With limited opportunities for advancement, people in high power distance nations in the lower strata may feel little motivation to be innovative as it is unlikely they will be able to reap the rewards directly or even get their idea noticed by those higher up in the social hierarchy. It appears that the degree to which a culture reduces the barriers between status levels‚Äîthat is, places a high value on egalitarianism‚Äîis, in some manner, connected to levels of innovation. This means that as a person in a country feels able to approach, make suggestions to, and debate with someone in a higher status position, so does that country‚Äôs innovation score increase. Thus, the increased amount of communication between the levels of society and within business could allow for the easier flow and acceptability of innovation ideas. It should also be noted that egalitarian societies emphasize meritocracy which can, in turn, put an emphasis on education (Lipset, 1990). A society in which people rise and fall based on merit is a society in which competitiveness is more likely to occur. In such a society, innovation provides an edge to those who are competitively inclined.Also, in support of Shane‚Äôs (1992, 1993) findings, our analysis indicates that individualism is strongly and positively related to innovation. The positive relationship between individualism and innovation suggests that autonomy, independence, and freedom‚Äîbeliefs associated with individualism‚Äîare needed for a nation to be innovative. In individualist societies, speaking one‚Äôs mind is highly valued whereas in collectivist societies direct confrontation is avoided to maintain harmony (Hofstede, 2010). Innovation thrives on ideas and in collectivist societies the avoidance of confrontation may serve to limit the number of ideas that get expressed and heard. Furthermore, research within the field of psychology suggests that students within individualist society have more creative potential than students within collectivist societies (Jaquish & Ripple, 1984; Jellen & Urban, 1989; Zha et al., 2006). In individualist societies, the purpose of getting an education is to learn how to learn (Hofstede, 2010). According to Amabile (1983), this type of learning environment fosters creativity. By contrast, in collectivist societies, the purpose of education is to learn how to do (Hofstede, 2010). This type of learning environment may stifle creativity as children are not allowed sufficient opportunity to pursue personal interests and initiatives. In a world in which technology is rapidly changing, the emphasis in individualist societies on learning how to learn, may put such nations in a better position as far as innovation with members being better able to adapt to a world in which they will be constantly needing new skills.Our analysis indicates that uncertainty avoidance is unrelated to innovation as measured by the GII. This is not an entirely surprising finding. Shane found mixed results with respect to uncertainty avoidance. In his 1992 study, Shane found no relationship between uncertainty avoidance and patents. However, in his 1993 study, a relationship between uncertainty avoidance and trademarks was identified (low uncertainty avoidance was associated with a higher number of trademarks) and Shane concluded that uncertainty avoiding cultures were slower regarding innovation. Our findings support Shane‚Äôs original findings showing no clear relationship between uncertainty avoidance and innovation. The principal driver behind Hofstede‚Äôs uncertainty avoidance dimension appears to be a desire for control, such that outcomes can be reasonably accurately predicted. A need for control can both help and hinder innovation.Research comparing self-employment levels with a nation‚Äôs Uncertainty Avoidance score found that self-employment was actually higher in  uncertainty avoiding cultures (Hofstede et al., 2010). Researchers found that low subjective well-being was associated with uncertainty avoiding cultures and this in turn was the likely motivator for people to choose self-employment as self-employment provided people with greater perceived control over their lives. According to Schumpeter (1983), entrepreneurs, such as those who start their own business, are a significant source of innovation. In this instance, the need for control may actually be spurring innovation. Similarly, uncertainty avoiding countries may be better at developing innovative ideas into new products and services as implementation requires attention to detail and punctuality. Uncertainty accepting countries, however, may be better at coming up with innovative ideas and with basic innovations. In either case, uncertainty avoiding and accepting, innovation does take place. It is the form of innovation that changes.It is important to note that although cultural characteristics may limit innovation, nations do have the potential to overcome cultural deficits to innovation once they become aware of the situation. Fukuyama (1995), for example, writes of those cultures predisposed to high trust and those predisposed to low trust among their people. High trust societies have a strong sense of communal solidarity which enables the formation of large scale business enterprises. Low trust societies, however, limit their trust to family members or an ethnic group and businesses are kept small, often within a family. The result of different levels of trust has led to different roles of the state. In low trust societies, such as Italy and China, the government has intervened to help create large-scale business. The same can be done for cultural deficits to innovation. The key is in identifying the deficit. Our results indicate that power distance is strongly and negatively related to national measures of innovation whereas individualism is strongly and positively related to measures of innovation. Government and business policies designed to overcome or work around issues of power distance and a collectivist orientation may prove helpful for national-level innovation.Although 66 nations from across the world were utilized in this study, further research is needed as the Middle East and Africa were underrepresented in the sample (Hofstede measures were unavailable). Future research should also look into the role institutional frameworks, such as laws and innovation policies; play in complicating or mitigating cultural values in so far as they influence innovation. As previously mentioned, government policies and initiatives can work to overcome cultural deficits to innovation. Exploring ways in which governments and businesses have successfully ‚Äúworked around‚Äù culture to be innovative would be of great interest academically as well as practically.","Hofstede‚Äôs value dimensions offer a measure of one component of culture (cultural values) and are a means of gaining greater understanding of the role culture plays in national innovation success. Hofstede‚Äôs (1980) cultural measures of individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and power distance, for example, have been shown to be correlated to the number (per capita) of trademarks (Shane, 1993). Via multivariate multiple linear regression, we assess the link between Hofstede‚Äôs measures of cultural values and innovation as measured by the Global Innovation Index (GII). Our analyses show a strong negative relationship between Hofstede‚Äôs dimensions of power distance and GII innovation scores as well as a strong positive relationship between individualism and GII innovation scores. No relationship was found for Hofstede‚Äôs measure of uncertainty avoidance.","6",0,"6","Political",4,0
205,63,"Lacko, D., Dufkov√°, E., & Machackova, H. (2023). Does aggressive commentary by streamers during violent video game affect state aggression in adolescents? New Media & Society, online first. https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448231182620","Videogame streaming presents a new type of media entertainment that has not yet received much research attention for its potential negative influence on a person‚Äôs internal state, especially aggression. The current study followed an established line of research to examine the effect of violent video games on cognitive and affective state aggression, captured as state hostility and normative beliefs about aggression to detect evidence for the role of short-term exposure to a streamer‚Äôs aggressive commentary (i.e. situational factor) in trait aggression and trait empathy (i.e. personal factors), and to understand the role of long-term exposure to violence, violent video games and violent streaming (i.e. environmental factors).
Our results showed that neither the presence of streamers nor their aggressive commentary led to an increase in affective and cognitive state aggression. Furthermore, the commentary did not moderate a single association between personal and environmental factors and state aggression. It appears that short-term exposure to aggressive commentary does not increase aggressive thoughts or have an effect beyond the potential effect of the game itself and, concurrently, exposure to non-aggressive commentary does not decrease aggressive thoughts. Hypotheses 1 and 2 about the role of the streamer were not supported.
We did not replicate the experimental findings that short-term exposure to violent streaming elicits greater aggression than non-violent streaming (Clarke, 2020). However, since his study compared the commentaries of violent streamers during violent video games with non-violent streamers‚Äô commentaries during non-violent games, the discrepancy between the findings can be attributed to the overcharging effect of violent video games. Our findings do correspond to studies that did not find any effect in the context of sports commentary. For example, Frederick et al. (2013) compared justified violence in commentary (i.e. blame mainly on the victim, less blame on the perpetrator) and unjustified violence (i.e. blame only on the perpetrator and concurrent rejection of violence) and found that they do not affect normative beliefs. Lee et al. (2015) compared colour commentary (i.e. favouring the home team, disapproving and referring to the away team as an enemy) and objective commentary (i.e. comments not favouring either team) and found that neither affected hostility.
In the context of live-streaming, it is possible that viewers tend to reframe content that is uncomfortable, emotional or aggressive by reacting to it with humour and comedy (i.e. stream-humour; Johnson, 2022). This could be a plausible explanation for the observed lack of difference between aggressive and non-aggressive commentaries. It is also possible that an increase in aggression is potentially conditioned by the viewers‚Äô types of usage of live-streaming services. As Cabeza-Ram√≠rez et al. (2022) found, problematic use, not the regular watching of live streams, is linked to aggressive behaviour. Since our study focused on mere exposure and not problematic use, the increase in aggression may not have manifested.
Nevertheless, the insignificant differences between aggressive and non-aggressive conditions may have an alternative explanation. Although aggressive commentary highlights violence during the game, non-aggressive commentary also draws attention to violence through the streamer‚Äôs rejection. It is possible that rejecting aggression in violent media content elicits a similar response to emphasising the content. For example, sports commentary research sometimes uses both the enjoyment of aggression towards the opposing team and rejection of aggression towards the home team as an experimental condition (i.e. dramatic commentary; see Sullivan, 1991). This suggests that both commentaries (i.e. aggressive, non-aggressive) are not orthogonal but rather emphasise aggression from different points of view. Without further evidence this explanation is only speculation.
Our remaining two hypotheses about the influence of personal and environmental factors on state aggression were only partially supported. Personal factors appeared to be stronger predictors of state aggression than environmental factors. The strongest personal predictor was trait sympathy, which was moderately associated with lower state hostility and largely associated with lower general normative beliefs. This is in line with previous research that found sympathy is more strongly related to aggression than cognitive and affective empathy (Vossen et al., 2016; Vossen and Fikkers, 2020). It appears that trait sympathy may play a protective role during exposure to violent content. Trait cognitive empathy was not related to state aggression (similar to, for instance, Jiang et al., 2019; Vossen et al., 2015) and trait affective empathy was associated with higher state hostility. The positive association of trait affective empathy and state aggression contrasts previous extensive research on aggression (e.g. Jiang et al., 2019; Vossen et al., 2015, 2016; Vossen and Fikkers, 2020).
This association may seem counterintuitive, but it can be explained if we consider the targeted subject for emotional expression. Sympathy represents feelings of concern and sorrow for another person‚Äôs distress (Clark, 2010). We believe that the enemy ‚Äì the red humanoids that were slaughtered violently (i.e. not the main character, who survived, or a streamer) ‚Äì is the target subject for sympathy. In this case, higher sympathy reduces state aggression and general normative beliefs about aggression and plays a more protective role. However, affective empathy represents experiencing and sharing another‚Äôs psychological state or feelings (Mehrabian and Epstein, 1972). We believe that the target of trait affective empathy is not the enemy but the main character or a streamer whose aim is to survive in a virtual ‚Äòkill or be killed‚Äô situation. In this specific situation, higher affective empathy could lead to higher emotions related to threats and subsequent higher-state aggression. This aligns with earlier studies on live streaming, which found that viewers tend to have an emotional and empathic response when streamers disclose personal mental health issues (e.g. Gandhi et al., 2021; Uttarapong et al., 2022). This indicates that viewers with a high level of affective empathy can be deeply affected by the emotional experiences of streamers. Because our study cannot provide direct support for this explanation, additional research on this topic is required.
Another personal factor that indicated a significant relationship to state aggression was trait aggression. Adolescents who were already more aggressive displayed higher state hostility after exposure to the video. This is in line with previous research (e.g. Anderson and Dill, 2000; Ferguson et al., 2008, 2014; Lin, 2013a; Peng et al., 2008). However, trait aggression was not associated with normative beliefs about aggression.
The last significant personal factor was gender: boys expressed higher retaliation normative beliefs about aggression (but not state hostility) compared to girls. This is also in line with previous studies (e.g. Hilvert-Bruce and Neill, 2019; Huesmann and Guerra, 1997). Age was not associated with state aggression.
Concerning environmental factors, only long-term exposure to violence was associated with higher retaliation normative beliefs (but not state hostility). In line with previous research (e.g. Chaux and Castellanos, 2014; Orue et al., 2011), adolescents who were more frequently exposed to online and offline violence in the preceding 6 months indicated higher state aggression. The frequent self-reported long-term watching of streams in which streamers behaved violently or aggressively did not reveal a relationship to state aggression; this finding supports the results we obtained from short-term experimental exposure to aggressive commentary. Frequent playing of violent video games in the long term also indicated no relationship to higher state aggression. These findings of insignificance correspond to several recent methodologically sound longitudinal studies (e.g. Ferguson and Wang, 2019; K√ºhn et al., 2018; Przybylski and Weinstein, 2019; see also Drummond et al., 2020).
Limitations and future research
This study has some limitations that should be considered. To determine the true role of streamers, we manipulated only their commentaries and set all other live-streaming aspects as constant for all conditions. Such a strict experimental setting does not pursue ecological validity (as is currently done with different methodologies, e.g. Cabeza-Ram√≠rez et al., 2022; Chen and Chang, 2019); rather, it controls for various potential extraneous confounding variables and manipulates the independent variable to provide strong evidence for causality (cf. Stein et al., 2022). The main discrepancies between the artificial recordings that we used in the experiment and genuine live-streaming sessions are in the lack of live chat, the lack of some social aspects, and incomplete interactivity (i.e. they were passively present, but participants were not able to actively participate), and in the very brief exposure to the video (2‚Äâminutes). In a genuine live-streaming session, viewers usually watch streamers for a much longer period, sometimes for several hours, and the chat is a crucial aspect in the social component of this experience. It is reasonable to expect that longer, more intense exposure and the presence of an online chat with the interaction between the viewers and the streamer would elicit different viewer responses because, for instance, the presence of interactivity can increase aggression (e.g. Lin, 2013a, 2013b; Weber et al., 2020). In future research, the methodology can be modified to examine the role of streamers under different experimental settings (e.g. manipulation of user chat, live experimental manipulation to involve real interaction between participants, longer exposure). Even though the experimental manipulation allowed us to examine the causal effects, its transferability to natural situations is limited. Therefore, future research could also focus on the long-term repeated effects via longitudinal and quasi-experimental designs to complement our findings with the impact of longer exposure to live-streaming that corresponds more to the real-world experience.
In an error on our part as researchers, we asked participants to assess the violence in the recording as a whole, without specifically focusing on the streamer‚Äôs commentary. Consequently, we did not obtain sufficient evidence to verify the functionality of the experimental manipulation. Due to ethical constraints that concern younger adolescent participants, our ‚Äòaggressive‚Äô condition was gently aggressive, but streamers‚Äô commentaries (and thus the real effects) in a real-life environment can be more explicit.
The effect of a violent video game itself was only assumed, not verified. It is possible that the streamed game did not elicit any change in state aggression in the adolescents. In this case, the difference between experimental conditions without a streamer and those with a non-aggressive streamer‚Äôs commentary would vanish (because it would be impossible for non-aggressive commentary to reduce the non-existing effect of violent content). Nevertheless, the difference between aggressive commentary and other conditions would remain even in this case because aggressive commentary represents violent content in itself. In future research, verification of our findings in non-violent content would be beneficial.
Finally, some of the scales possessed shortcomings in the pre-registered factor structure. To solve these issues, we introduced several modifications. The main problem appeared in relation to the scale for normative beliefs about aggression, where we were forced to remove the majority of items in both subscales based on the data-driven approach which may have jeopardised content validity. It is possible that the truncated version of the scale did not correctly reflect the proposed theoretical constructs. Furthermore, the measurement we applied was related only to the self-report measurement of the person‚Äôs internal state. Therefore, the measurement of a person‚Äôs (non)-aggressive behaviour, per se, as well as the measurement of the internal state via objective physiological measurement, might provide crucial evidence about the link between the streamer‚Äôs commentary and aggression in the future.
Contributions of the study
The current study has three main contributions. It is innovative in offering the first desirable feedback for the GAM and the ongoing debate on the predictive power of situational factors (cf. Ferguson and Dyck, 2012; Ferguson et al., 2008, 2014). Even though the GAM proposes that even short-term exposure to violent content increases state aggression, it appears that the situational factor represented by an aggressive streamer‚Äôs commentary is not associated with higher levels of state aggression.
In this line of thought, the unexpected theoretical contribution of the study lies in the evidence for the different functioning of trait affective empathy and trait sympathy while watching another person‚Äôs violent gameplay. It seems necessary to distinguish between the target objects of both processes during exposure to violent video games or streams, because it is possible that each process attaches to different objects of exposure (i.e. the main character in the case of trait affective empathy, the harmed subjects in the case of trait sympathy). Hence, associations between various facets of empathy may function even in the opposite direction, which has not yet been reflected in the prior research and theory.
In terms of practical implications we propose that the general concerns related to aggressive narration in streamed games should not be exaggerated. With regulated non-problematic use of live-streaming services (cf. Cabeza-Ram√≠rez et al., 2022; Chen and Chang, 2019; Hasan et al., 2018), aggression in children should not be elevated. By contrast, as previous literature suggests, children could benefit from other aspects of these services, especially socially (Hamilton et al., 2014; Wulf et al., 2020) to help them cope with difficult life situations (De Wit et al., 2020).
However, our data showed that adolescents who are generally more aggressive or sensitive (i.e. affective empathy) might experience increased negative and aggressive emotions after mere exposure to a streamed violent video game. We recommend that the parents of these adolescents should be more cautious with regard to what kind of content their children watch, because they can be more prone to (short-term) negative responses. While this recommendation is usually targeted to the parents of children with higher trait aggression, our findings emphasise that such increased efforts in the mediation of adolescent‚Äôs media use should be relevant among parents of children with higher affective empathy.","In the past 10‚Äâyears, live-streaming services have gained huge popularity. Streamers usually play video games and complement their performance with commentary. We examine the role of this streamer commentary on state aggression in Czech adolescents who were randomly assigned into one of the three experimental groups (i.e. aggressive commentary, non-aggressive commentary, no commentary). The findings suggest that a short-term streamer‚Äôs commentary has no effect on affective and cognitive state aggression. In addition, the experimental conditions did not moderate any effects of personal traits (i.e. aggression, empathy) and long-term environmental factors (i.e. exposure to violence, watching violent streams, playing violent video games) on state aggression. We found that trait aggression, trait affective empathy and long-term exposure to violence were positively associated with state aggression, whereas trait sympathy was negatively associated with state aggression. The findings enrich the research with evidence for the lack of influence of streamer commentary on viewer aggression.","Apolitical",1,"4","Apolitical",4,1

Obesity Reviews: An Official Journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity, 16(9), 783‚Äì794. https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.12287","Summary of evidenceAVGs had a large effect on children/adolescents‚Äô physio-logical and psychological outcomes as compared to sedentary behaviours. In particular, the Ô¨Ånding suggeststhat playing AVGs increases energy expenditure, heart rate,METs, VO2 max and PA from resting, which is in accord-ance with the previous conceptual reviews (34,36,38,52).The results also favoured AVGs over sedentary activitieswith large effect sizes on the rate of perceived exertion andenjoyment. Given that many children/adolescents spend alarge amount of time in sedentary behaviours on a dailybasis (1), the Ô¨Åndings represent an optimistic message forpublic health. They suggest that AVGs can be used toreplace children/adolescents‚Äô sedentary behaviours, such asscreen time while maintaining game enjoyment and attrac-tiveness. Although the Ô¨Åndings are promising, there was amoderate risk of bias in the included studies based upon theassessment of each study. This Ô¨Ånding also needs to betaken with caution in that the challenge facing health pro-fessionals is to encourage children/adolescents to replacesedentary behaviours, but not other PAs or sports (65),with AVGs.Effect sizes of AVGs were not signiÔ¨Åcantly different inincreasing VO2 max and rating of perceived exertion thanlaboratory-based exercise, as found in the previous reviews(35,38). The effect sizes on heart rate, however, favouredAVGs with small to moderate margins. The Ô¨Ånding is not inline with the previous postulation indicating that no differ-ence in heart rate occurred between AVGs and traditionalexercise (41). This inconsistency may be the results of thedistinct unit of analysis, exercise type and sample inclusion.For instance, Peng et al. (41) treated each individual studyas the unit of analysis, whereas the present study codedeach comparison (i.e. DDR vs. treadmill walking/running;Wii Boxing vs. running, Wii Bowling vs. walking) as theunit of analysis within each study. Using individual com-parison as unit of analysis rendered larger sample size ofeffect sizes, which allowed us to further classify laboratory-based exercises into different categories (i.e. walking,jogging, running, cycling). It was found that, in general,AVGs‚Äô margin over laboratory-based exercises reduced asexercise intensity increased from light to moderate inten-sity. Interestingly, AVGs had small effect sizes for energyexpenditure and METs over laboratory-based exercise.Although inferential statistical analyses were not per-formed for these outcomes due to small sample sizes,further investigation is warranted to explore the utility ofAVGs on energy expenditure and METs. In addition, thecomparison on enjoyment demonstrated small effect sizesfavouring AVGs. The Ô¨Åndings are encouraging in thatplaying AVGs produces not only the equivalent magnitudeof effect as light- to moderate-intensity PA but also is funand enjoyable to children/adolescents.The small magnitudes of the effect sizes in Ô¨Åeld-basedstudies indicate that AVGs produced equivalent effects onmoderate PA, and vigorous PA as Ô¨Åeld-based PA. However,this meta-analysis also found that AVGs had a moderate effect size on cardiovascular Ô¨Åtness, whereas Ô¨Åeld-based PAdemonstrated a small effect size on METs and body com-position. While these Ô¨Åndings appear contradictory andinconclusive, more research studies utilizing AVGs in Ô¨Åeld-based settings are warranted and encouraged. Psychologi-cally, AVGs produced a moderate effect size for self-efÔ¨Åcacyand a small effect size for other psychological outcomessuch as enjoyment/liking and attitudes. This result is in linewith many empirical studies (24,32,44,57,66). Takentogether, it is recommended that professionals employ AVGinterventions as a viable option to promote children/adolescents‚Äô PA and health, as AVGs are more attractiveand enjoyable for children/adolescents in comparison withtraditional PA. That is, AVGs can be used as an excellentaddition to, but not a replacement for, traditional intensivePA or sports in children/adolescents‚Äô daily life (24,67).Additionally, the Ô¨Åndings suggest that AVG interventionsfor children/adolescents in Ô¨Åeld-based settings should bedeveloped based upon the characteristics that have thegreatest effects (i.e. intervention length). The moderatoranalysis demonstrated that children/adolescents beneÔ¨Åtmore from AVG interventions when the interventions arelonger (i.e. 8 weeks or more) compared with shorter inter-ventions. This Ô¨Ånding is consistent with the previous PAintervention studies (20,24,32,56,60). Currently, onlyAVGs that mainly involved whole body movements andlower body movements (primarily DDR) have been imple-mented in Ô¨Åeld-based studies. As expected, the data suggestthat these two types of AVGs generated similar healthbeneÔ¨Åts for children/adolescents, partially supporting Penget al.‚Äôs Ô¨Ånding (41). The Ô¨Ånding further conÔ¨Årms that AVGsrequiring large muscle groups‚Äô movement (lower bodyor whole body) are effective in promoting children/adolescents‚Äô PA (52). In addition, this study found thatdifferent types of AVG (e.g. Wii, DDR) had marginallypositive effects over Ô¨Åeld-based PA. Lastly, this meta-analysis found that protocols for assessing PA did not mod-erate the relationship between PA interventions and healthoutcomes. Given the limited sample for assessing PA, futurestudies examining this moderator with larger samples arewarranted.LimitationsAlthough this meta-analysis offers a unique contribution tothe literature in relation to health effects of AVGs, severallimitations should be identiÔ¨Åed. Firstly, the authors werenot able to categorize children/adolescents into subgroups(e.g. young children, children and adolescents) becausesome studies did not provide detailed information on age(5,21,56,58). Future studies should further investigate theeffect sizes by age groups (e.g. younger than 12 years old;12 years old and older) to capture the developmental dif-ferences in playing AVGs. Secondly, this meta-analysis holistically assessed multiple physiological and psychologi-cal effects of AVGs (e.g. PA, enjoyment), but some of theseincluded outcome variables might have been deÔ¨Åned ormeasured differently. The authors attempted to adjust forthe impact of such inconsistency by testing moderators.However, it is difÔ¨Åcult for a meta-analysis not to examinediverse studies on the topic of interest. Thirdly, two differ-ent ways of obtaining effect size were utilized to capturetreatment effects of AVGs (AVG group post-pre standard-ized difference minus control group post-pre standardizeddifference, when a control group was available; AVG grouppost-pre standardized difference, when a single grouprepeated measure design was used). Although the method isdeemed conventional and has been previously utilized inother similar research (48), it might have brought upon biasto the meta-analysis. Thus, the Ô¨Åndings should be con-sumed with caution. Fourthly, given the diversity of AVGresearch, a variety of outcome variables have been exam-ined. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, some outcome variableswere more frequently (physiological measures such as heartrate) examined than others (psychological measures such asself-efÔ¨Åcacy). Indeed, the articles included in the presentmeta-analysis have met stringent inclusion criteria and arein high quality; however, we acknowledge that summativeÔ¨Åndings based upon a small number of empirical studies areby no means conclusive. More similar research studiesexamining these less frequently studied outcome variables,especially psychological outcomes, are warranted. Finally,the present review, like many other meta-analytic studies,only included published studies for analysis, raising theissue of publication bias. It should be acknowledged thatthere are relevant studies on the topic, although not pub-lished and/or accessible through the university librarysearch engines. Despite the limitations, the Ô¨Åndings of thismeta-analysis may help professionals to better implementeffective AVGs among children/adolescents. SpeciÔ¨Åcally,AVG interventions will be more successful when they areoffered over a longer period and involving whole body orlower body movements.Additionally, the Ô¨Åndings have identiÔ¨Åed questions forfuture research. For instance, why did AVGs induce higherheart rate than laboratory-based exercise? Why was notthere a moderator effect of measurement protocols forassessing PA in the effect sizes of AVGs? Why was the meaneffect size of METs negative in Ô¨Åeld-based settings? Thisreview identiÔ¨Åed these phenomena in a systematicapproach. These questions need to be answered throughfurther research inquiries. Moreover, the Ô¨Åndings of thisreview provide guidelines for future research, including,but not limited to, the following: (i) determine whetherchildren/adolescents with access to AVGs can actuallyreplace their screen times with AVGs as opposed to tradi-tional sports or PA; (ii) quantify the role of AVG in con-tributing to children/adolescents‚Äô daily PA levels; (iii) examine the long-term effectiveness of playing AVGs innon-structured (i.e. home) and structured (i.e. school) set-tings; (iv) consider the effects of moderator variables suchas age, gender and socioeconomic status in AVG interven-tions; and (v) conduct process evaluation for AVGs toensure the intervention Ô¨Ådelity.ConclusionsThis review provides an overview and synthesis of healthbeneÔ¨Åts of AVGs among children/adolescents and offersrecommendations for future interventions by comparingthe effects across different settings. The Ô¨Åndings have publichealth implications that can help inform healthcare stake-holders regarding AVG interventions among children/adolescents. For example, health professionals mayintegrate AVGs at schools, communities and homes to helpchildren/adolescents develop a healthy lifestyle. It is recom-mended that professionals replace sedentary behaviour butnot the traditional PA and sports with AVGs. Meanwhile,the fun and/or boredom factors of AVGs should be takeninto considerations during programme implementation. Inparticular, AVGs need to be constantly upgraded orupdated to hold children‚Äôs interest for behavioural sustain-ability. Overall, given the fun component embedded in thegames, AVGs are desirable as a promising addition topromote PA and health by replacing these sedentarybehaviours.","This meta-analysis synthesizes current literature concerning the effects of activevideo games (AVGs) on children/adolescents‚Äô health-related outcomes. A total of512 published studies on AVGs were located, and 35 articles were included basedon the following criteria: (i) data-based research articles published in Englishbetween 1985 and 2015; (ii) studied some types of AVGs and related outcomesamong children/adolescents and (iii) had at least one comparison within eachstudy. Data were extracted to conduct comparisons for outcome measures in threeseparate categories: AVGs and sedentary behaviours, AVGs and laboratory-basedexercise, and AVGs and Ô¨Åeld-based physical activity. Effect size for each entry wascalculated with the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software in 2015. Mean effectsize (Hedge‚Äôs g) and standard deviation were calculated for each comparison.Compared with sedentary behaviours, AVGs had a large effect on health out-comes. The effect sizes for physiological outcomes were marginal when comparingAVGs with laboratory-based exercises. The comparison between AVGs andÔ¨Åeld-based physical activity had null to moderate effect sizes. AVGs could yieldequivalent health beneÔ¨Åts to children/adolescents as laboratory-based exercise orÔ¨Åeld-based physical activity. Therefore, AVGs can be a good alternative for sed-entary behaviour and addition to traditional physical activity and sports inchildren/adolescents.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Political",4,1

Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology, 57(1), 1‚Äì24. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-021-02159-w. The findings also raise the possibility that national health expenditure, which has traditionally focused on the development and provision of mental health services that work with the individual to target symptom reduction [120], may need to include parallel investments into a wider range of services as part of a more systemic, preventative approach if they are to be effective [121, 122]. For example, Marmot [123] has argued for the importance of focusing on ‚Äúearly child development and education, work environments, building healthy communities and supporting active social engagement of older people‚Äù in overcoming the effects of social inequality on health (p. 153). Conversely, we would suggest that the findings strongly call into question the wisdom of implementing mixed tenure policies that aim to create mixed communities, including with respect to income [124].  Relatedly, an argument might also be made for tackling inequality more directly, i.e. as primary causal/upstream factor, as part of government policy. Thus, many academics, including economists [125] and epidemiologists [123], have argued that trends for rising inequality can be reversed through targeted changes in social policy without sacrificing overall economic growth [126]. Proven tools in this regard include progressive taxation and focused expenditure aimed at improving education and reducing hunger and poverty [127, 128]. Relatedly, our finding that LMICs may be particularly susceptible to the negative effects of income inequality, suggests that international development and aid programmes, which have traditionally focused on increasing economic growth, may benefit from a broader remit that includes working to reduce economic inequality [129], a perspective that is reflected in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (Goal 10: ‚ÄòReduce inequality within and among countries‚Äô, p.14) [130].","Based on a systematic review of the literature we consistently found greater support for the IIH over the MNH. This pattern was not dependent on study quality, spatial scale, adjustment for absolute deprivation, nor country income level. However, a high proportion of studies supported neither hypothesis, reporting no significant association between inequality and mental health, or else mixed patterns of associations. To explain such a high level of null findings one might posit two possible explanations. First, that findings supportive of the IIH have arisen purely by chance, but are over-represented in the literature [109, 110]. Second, that the association is real, but statistically small and/or potentially dependent on other moderating variables. Consistent with the latter interpretation, a parallel modest association has also been documented between higher inequality and poorer physical health [27], with overlapping mechanisms having been proposed for mental and physical health [31]. Nonetheless, in reviewing the extant literature we identified a number of limitations, most notably a lack of adequate control for absolute deprivation (at the lower and higher-order levels) and the use of suboptimal (i.e. single-level) analyses.Considering more specific predictions of the IIH, the findings reported are broadly consistent with the notion that the effects of inequality are not limited to poorer members of society [11]. The association between higher inequality and poorer mental health persisted after controlling for absolute deprivation and was evidenced in HICs and LMICs. In addition, where studies investigated an interaction between inequality and absolute deprivation, a roughly equal proportion indicated that the poor or the rich were negatively impacted. Assuming a casual association (more on this below), this is a crucial finding with implications for the potential scale of impact and ways of incentivising change, since it implies that all segments of society stand to be affected by the negative effects of inequality, and by inference, stand to gain by addressing the issue.With respect to geographical scale [55, 96], the reported association persisted across all spatial scales studied, although it was somewhat more pronounced at higher spatial scales. Drawing on the SAH, these findings are consistent with social comparison [111] and social rank [112] theories, which posit that the negative effects of social comparisons operate across multiple reference groups and spatial scales, including the local [113, 114]. Such scaling effects may also be supported by the growing ubiquity of social/digital tools such as social network sites [115], which have arguably transformed the potential scope and scale of such comparative processes [116].Whilst the IIH makes no explicit predictions about the specificity of effects on different mental health conditions, stratification by mental health suggested that the association between inequality and mental health may be particularly pronounced in psychosis (although the sample size of studies was very small). It is unclear why this might be the case; however, one tentative hypothesis is that the lack of social integration and trust that arguably characterises unequal communities (according to the SCH and SAH) may  be particularly conducive to experiences of paranoia, a core symptom of psychosis [117]. These findings, if found to hold with further research, have potential implications for the commissioning and delivery of psychosis services (more on this below).With respect to the limitations of this review, no measure of sampling bias was included. Some studies used convenience sampling, and others purposely over-sampled specific ethnic groups or geographical regions so that conclusions could be drawn about low incidence groups (see Supplementary Information 3). Nonetheless, this may limit the generalizability of findings. Further, whilst the decision was based on firm theoretical grounds [60‚Äì62], the lack of integration of effect sizes across studies means that the real-world significance of the findings are difficult to gauge. Finally, no conclusions can be drawn about the direction of causality or underlying mechanisms. Whilst these were not the foci of the review, in the absence of such information the findings we report are merely consistent with the IIH. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that in a review of the literature into the association between inequality and health (more generally), the authors concluded that there was good support for the main criteria used to test for causality within a causal epidemiological framework, i.e. temporality, biological plausibility, consistency and lack of alternative explanations [118].If we accept the proposed notion of a casual association between inequality and mental health, several important implications emerge from our findings. Most fundamentally, they suggest that rising levels of inequality may drive increases in the incidence of mental health disorders, and arguably as a consequence, that inequality (alongside poverty and other environmental factors) should be placed at the centre of psychiatry and applied psychology [5]. For example, national guidelines for Early Intervention Psychosis services in the UK [119] state that commissioning ‚Äúshould be underpinned by estimated local incidence of psychosis, derived to incorporate a range of demographic features such as ethnicity, age, population density and deprivation‚Äù (p. 6), and to this we would add inequality as a further important factor for consideration.The findings also raise the possibility that national health expenditure, which has traditionally focused on the development and provision of mental health services that work with the individual to target symptom reduction [120], may need to include parallel investments into a wider range of services as part of a more systemic, preventative approach if they are to be effective [121, 122]. For example, Marmot [123] has argued for the importance of focusing on ‚Äúearly child development and education, work nvironments, building healthy communities and supporting active social engagement of older people‚Äù in overcoming the effects of social inequality on health (p. 153). Conversely, we would suggest that the findings strongly call into question the wisdom of implementing mixed tenure policies that aim to create mixed communities, including with respect to income [124].Relatedly, an argument might also be made for tackling inequality more directly, i.e. as primary causal/upstream factor, as part of government policy. Thus, many academics, including economists [125] and epidemiologists [123], have argued that trends for rising inequality can be reversed through targeted changes in social policy without sacrificing overall economic growth [126]. Proven tools in this regard include progressive taxation and focused expenditure aimed at improving education and reducing hunger and poverty [127, 128].

Whilst the review did not attempt to identify the mechanisms or direction of this association, the conclusions drawn reinforce the importance of inequality in potentially contributing to mental health problems in the population. Further research into the causal strength of such environmental predictors on psychological distress is urgently required so we can assess the potential value of implementing interventions to ameliorate the negative effects of inequality. This research effort now needs to gather pace, and is we would argue, underpinned by an ethical imperative. In a recent report entitled ‚ÄòBritain in the 2020s‚Äô the Institute for Public Policy Research [131] predicted that inequality will ‚Äúsurge‚Äù over the course of the decade (p. 12), with the income of the rich forecasted to rise 11 times faster than the incomes of the poor, and an extra 3.6 million predicted to fall into poverty within this time-frame.","Purpose A systematic review was undertaken to determine whether research supports: (i) an association between income inequality and adult mental health when measured at the subnational level, and if so, (ii) in a way that supports the Income Inequality Hypothesis (i.e. between higher inequality and poorer mental health) or the Mixed Neighbourhood Hypothesis (higher inequality and better mental health).Methods Systematic searches of PsycINFO, Medline and Web of Science databases were undertaken from database inception to September 2020. Included studies appeared in English-language, peer-reviewed journals and incorporated measure/s of objective income inequality and adult mental illness. Papers were excluded if they focused on highly specialised population samples. Study quality was assessed using a custom-developed tool and data synthesised using the vote-count method.Results Forty-two studies met criteria for inclusion representing nearly eight million participants and more than 110,000 geographical units. Of these, 54.76% supported the Income Inequality Hypothesis and 11.9% supported the Mixed Neighbourhood Hypothesis. This held for highest quality studies and after controlling for absolute deprivation. The results were consistent across mental health conditions, size of geographical units, and held for low/middle and high income countries.Conclusions A number of limitations in the literature were identified, including a lack of appropriate (multi-level) analyses and modelling of relevant confounders (deprivation) in many studies. Nonetheless, the findings suggest that area-level income inequality is associated with poorer mental health, and provides support for the introduction of social, economic and public health policies that ameliorate the deleterious effects of income inequality.","2",0,"2","Political",2,1

Psychology, Crime & Law: PC & L, 27(1), 61‚Äì75. https://doi.org/10.1080/1068316x.2020.1774589. Given the fact that a relatively high percentage of western children grow up in a single-parent family and that the consequences of crime are detrimental, it is important to investigate into more detail how this relation between single-parent families and crime works to ensure that criminal behavior by adolescents is minimized.","This systematic review provides an overview of 48 empirical studies on single-parentfamilies and crime of adolescents. Two general conclusions can be drawn. First, theresults suggest that growing up in a single-parent family and adolescent involvement incrime are related since a large majority of the studies shows a positive relation betweensingle-parent families and the level of crime. Second, since only one study reports onthe eÔ¨Äects of the diÔ¨Äerent constituting events of single-parent families on crime, it isclear that more research is needed.With respect to the Ô¨Årst research question, the results of the systematic review stronglysuggest the existence of a positive association between growing up in a single-parentfamily and crime by adolescents. This is in accordance with previous literature reviews con-ducted a couple of decades ago (e.g. Wells & Rankin, 1991), or that were more limited or broader in scope (e.g. Price & Kunz, 2003; Savage, 2014). The majority of the studies con-taining multivariate analyses also controlled for parental resources and parental attach-ment, but adding these constructs did not alter the results. This implies that the socialcontrol theory, the social control/parental absence model, and the economic strainmodel cannot (fully) explain the results of this review.The second research question involved the diÔ¨Äerent constituting events of single par-enthood. Juby and Farrington (2001) showed that reports on juvenile convictions suggestthat the adolescents in families disrupted by divorce/separation displayed higher levels ofcrime than adolescents in families disrupted by parental decease. This Ô¨Ånding is in linewith expectations from the family crisis model (although parental resentment was notincluded as a control variable in the analyses, so it cannot be checked whether resentmenttoward the parents after the divorce is a relevant factor increasing crime). However, norelationships were found in this study when delinquency was self-reported. Since thereis only one study on this topic and this study also shows contradictory results, it is impor-tant to investigate this issue in more detail in future research.This systematic review also has revealed some limitations of the included literature.First, almost all adolescent behavioral data were self-reported. These data are likely toinvolve underestimation of true levels of crime because of social desirability. Second, inalmost 30% of the studies, only boys were included as participants, although it is poss-ible that boys and girls respond diÔ¨Äerently to growing up in single-parent families.Third, the same datasets were used a couple of times in diÔ¨Äerent studies. Five datasetswere used twice, one dataset was used three times, and one dataset was used sixtimes. When the duplicate datasets were removed, however, the results stayedapproximately the same.There are several suggestions for future research. First, because the majority of theincluded studies were conducted in the USA, research should also be conducted inother cultural contexts. Second, this review contains many studies that were conducteda couple of decades ago. It is possible that the eÔ¨Äects in more recent time periodsdiÔ¨Äer from those found a couple of decades ago because of new regulations, such asco-parenting regulations after a divorce. However, since the studies conducted after theyear 2000 show only positive relations, it has to be investigated in more detail why therecent studies more often displayed a higher level of crime by adolescents from single-parent families. Third, this review only contains studies looking at the environmentaleÔ¨Äects of the family on the criminal behavior of the adolescents. However, it may alsobe interesting to look at the genetic inÔ¨Çuences.Concluding, this systematic review provides insights into the positive relation betweensingle-parent families and crime by adolescents. However, this systematic review alsoshows that research is lacking regarding the consequences of growing up in diÔ¨Äerenttypes of single-parent families. Therefore, we recommend researchers to expand theseresults and policy makers to wait for those results before making programs thattarget all children in single-parent families, while maybe these increased levels of crimewere only caused by adolescents of one type of single-parent family. Given the fact thata relatively high percentage of western children grow up in a single-parent family andthat the consequences of crime are detrimental, it is important to investigate into moredetail how this relation between single-parent families and crime works to ensure thatcriminal behavior by adolescents is minimized.","Many studies have investigated the relation between growing up insingle-parent families and crime. However, an up-to-date overviewof the literature on this topic is lacking. To Ô¨Åll this gap, this articlereviews the empirical literature regarding the eÔ¨Äects of beingraised in a single-parent family on criminal behavior of adolescentoÔ¨Äspring, and additionally focusses on whether the eÔ¨Äectsdepend on how single-parent families were constituted (byparental divorce or separation, by parental decease, or by beingborn to a single parent). A systematic search in Ô¨Åve electronicdatabases (Web of Science, PsycINFO, Scopus, SocINDEX, andEconLit) is conducted to identify empirical studies on this topic,resulting in 48 studies that conform to a range of substantive andmethodological selection criteria.

PloS One, 15(2), e0226799. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0226799","There is an ongoing quest to create a less polarized and more open-minded political climate in the United States [2, 23‚Äì25]. We believe this to be an important effort for several reasons. Studies show that polarization can bias information processing and decision making in detrimental ways [5‚Äì6, 48]. As a result, it often leads to fear, anger, and animosity towards the opposition [1, 9‚Äì10]. Polarization is also associated with dogmatic intolerance, which in turn increases the propensity to behave antisocially and to deny free speech [49]. Furthermore, polarization erodes central parts of civic society, such as trust in the government and media [50]. However, for a depolarization movement to be effective, we need to advance our theories on political attitude change and better understand the mechanisms underlying depolarization.

To contribute to this effort, we tested the choice blindness paradigm [26] with American voters just before the 2016 American general election. Our aim was to investigate whether participants could become less polarized in their political views. Study 1 was conducted during the week of the first presidential debate; Study 2 was conducted online with a larger and more representative sample. Participants responded to a survey comparing Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on various leadership traits. In both studies, the participants in our sample were clearly polarized when entering the study. Participants that favored either of the candidates had on average only 2 to 3 ‚Äúopen-minded‚Äù responses out of 12, defined by a response in the middle 30% of the visual analog scales. Participants then received false feedback about their responses: we nearly doubled the number of items that participants had in the open-minded category. Only a few of these manipulations were detected and corrected, which resulted in an overall score that made it appear as if the participants were more open-minded in their views towards the candidates. When asked to explain their score, the great majority of the participants accepted and justified their apparent open-mindedness, even though they had reported more polarized views moments earlier.

Supporters of Clinton and Trump are similarly susceptible to false feedback
In Experiment 2, both Clinton and Trump supporters behaved similarly on the experimental measures: they had similar correction rates to the choice blindness manipulations and justified their open-minded score to similar degrees. This is the first study we are aware of that demonstrates that liberals and conservatives are equally susceptible to false feedback about their own attitudes. Given previous findings that acceptance and justification of false survey feedback can lead to lasting changes in political attitudes [30], we see the lack of difference between Trump supporters and Clinton supporters as contributing to the ongoing research on the psychology of ideology. So far, this line of research indicates that liberals and conservatives are different in some aspects, such as personality [33], values [35‚Äì36], and thinking styles [38‚Äì39]. However, they are both similarly susceptible to cognitive biases [42‚Äì43]. Our findings show that choice blindness applies equally to conservatives and liberals. More generally, choice blindness offers a useful tool to test how liberals and conservatives reason‚Äîor rationalize‚Äîwhen presented with false information.

Choice blindness as a method to study depolarization
The current study was not intended as a practical method to influence voters but rather as a novel investigation of experimental depolarization in the political domain. We find that giving people false feedback can be an effective way to, at least momentarily, make them perceive themselves as more open towards competing candidates. This shows that even deeply held beliefs depend on situational factors and can be flexible under certain circumstances. From a theoretical perspective, we believe that participants interpret their own behavior‚Äîin this case their survey responses‚Äîand infer the reasons behind these responses [51‚Äì54]. Choice blindness could therefore be useful to study the depolarization of extreme views. For example, we could measure how susceptibility to choice blindness and confabulation are affected by the direction of the manipulation, such as going from polarized to moderate, or vice versa. This could help us understand whether being moderate or undecided is a distinct pole of its own. If so, we could explore whether these moderate views are more or less susceptible to false information. Here, the framing of moderate views may play an important role. In our studies, participants received positive false feedback about their survey responses. Instead of suggesting to people that they are open-minded, we might have found different results if participants had been told that they were ‚Äúwishy-washy‚Äù, ‚Äúflip-flopping‚Äù, ‚Äúuncertain‚Äù, ‚Äúcentrist‚Äù, or even ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù. Future work could examine how participants behave when they are given false negative or more neutral feedback as well.

The effectiveness of choice blindness in the political domain distinguishes it from many other forms of persuasion, such as perspective-taking [55‚Äì56]. In a recent study, Catapano and colleagues [57] found that such methods are less effective for deep-seated attitudes, such as those relating to politics. In fact, imagining the perspectives of out-group members can even backfire and hinder subsequent attitude change. This could partially be explained by the fact that in those paradigms, participants are fully aware that the perspective they consider is not their own and that the arguments they express are hypothetical. In choice blindness experiments, however, participants often believe that the response they are asked to explain reflects their own true attitude.

Limitations and future studies
In Experiment 1, only 12% of all manipulations were corrected, but in Experiment 2, 41% of them were. The reasons behind this difference are difficult to isolate given the variation in design between the two studies (such as the number of manipulations, the instructions for revisiting their responses, and verbal versus written explanations). One potential explanation is the plausibility of the manipulation. In Experiment 1, the manipulations were performed using a magic trick, which is extremely improbable in the context of a typical political opinion survey. Likely none of the participants had ever filled out a pen-and-paper survey that changed seconds later. Thus, if the participants lack perfect access to their own attitudes (or if political attitudes are not stored for us to access; [58‚Äì59]), then the manipulated survey responses ought to function as a prime source of evidence about their own attitudes [51‚Äì52]. The (presumably non-conscious) inference may look something like: ‚ÄúI wrote these responses, so either they must be my true attitudes, or else I made several large errors‚Äù. So, if people see themselves as competent at answering a simple questionnaire, making a series of large errors would seem less plausible. In contrast, in Experiment 2, even though we attempted to replicate the general procedure of the original trick, participants were faced with a far less magical procedure. People are familiar with malfunctioning computer programs and websites, and thus our participants would have had little difficulty in concluding that there may have simply been a software error when saving their responses that needs correcting.

Another explanation might be the difference between verbally explaining versus silently revising the manipulations. While participants in Experiment 2 were also confronted with the manipulations, they did not have to engage in the mental task of having to recall or generate arguments for them. On the face of it, one might expect this additional reasoning process to generate more corrections, presumably by helping participants think more deeply about the issue and discovering that they do not agree with the manipulated position. However, if deliberation serves not as attitudinal fact-checking but as a way for participants to further commit to and defend their own ostensible attitudes, the reasoning process might lead to fewer corrections [53‚Äì54]. A third explanation could be simply that Experiment 2 was conducted closer to the election compared to Experiment 1, and that a larger proportion of the participants in Experiment 2 had firmly decided who they would vote for. Finally, it could also have been that the cover story in Experiment 2‚Äîtelling participants to check their responses in case they had been affected by presentation order‚Äîmay have primed participants be more attentive and to search for inconsistencies.

Prior to the current study, choice blindness had only been used to study what might be called ‚Äúrepolarization‚Äù‚Äîfor example by shifting people from agreeing to disagreeing with a statement. Here, for the first time, we show that it is possible to use the same methodology to depolarize people, by making them adopt the idea that they are more ‚Äúopen-minded‚Äù.

In future studies, we could also explore more global attitude shifts. In the two experiments presented here, the manipulations did not influence the candidate competency/favorability ratings. Had this been found, it would have been a unique case of attitude generalization where manipulation on some character judgments would bleed over and affect another more general trait. Perhaps political competency is judged somewhat independently of the specific traits in our survey.

Conclusion
Our findings corroborate a recent large-scale analysis of survey data with answers from 140 000 people across over 60 countries [60]. The researchers found that people across the political spectrum were more similar than they were different on several moral and political attitudes. We share their conclusion that similarities between the attitudes of people and groups tend to be overlooked, suggesting that the ‚Äúus versus them‚Äù dichotomy is a prevalent but perhaps exaggerated narrative. We hope our findings can be used to simulate polarizing societal forces and thus contribute to the search for an effective remedy sought by the political depolarization movements [2, 23‚Äì25]. Our study reveals that American voters at either end of the political spectrum are willing to endorse more open views about both candidates with surprisingly little intervention. Here, suggesting to people that they are more open-minded removed their political blinders and nudged them to consider and argue for more moderate views. These results offer hope in a divided political climate: even polarized people can become‚Äîat least momentarily‚Äîopen to opposing views.","American politics is becoming increasingly polarized, which biases decision-making and reduces open-minded debate. In two experiments, we demonstrate that despite this polarization, a simple manipulation can make people express and endorse less polarized views about competing political candidates. In Study 1, we approached 136 participants at the first 2016 presidential debate and on the streets of New York City. Participants completed a survey evaluating Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on various personality traits; 72% gave responses favoring a single candidate. We then covertly manipulated their surveys so that the majority of their responses became moderate instead. Participants only noticed and corrected a few of these manipulations. When asked to explain their responses, 94% accepted the manipulated responses as their own and rationalized this neutral position accordingly, even though they reported more polarized views moments earlier. In Study 2, we replicated the experiment online with a more politically diverse sample of 498 participants. Both Clinton and Trump supporters showed nearly identical rates of acceptance and rationalization of their manipulated-to-neutral positions. These studies demonstrate how false feedback can powerfully shape the expression of political views. More generally, our findings reveal the potential for open-minded discussion even in a fundamentally divided political climate.","Apolitical",1,"4","Political",4,1

Overall, our review showed that racism is associated with multiple poor physiological systems and biological processes in childhood and adolescence, although evidence remains relatively emergent. Nonetheless, these findings have implications for health and wellbeing during childhood and adolescence, as well as for future chronic disease risk, and begin to elucidate how racism becomes embodied and embedded in early life. Grounded in strong explicit conceptual and theoretical understandings of systemic racism and health combined with socio-ecological models of child and youth development, we must continue to articulate and empirically quantify the profound health harms of racism for children and youth from racialised backgrounds and the contribution of racism to the health inequities they experience (Priest et al., in press; Shonkoff et al., 2021; Slopen and Heard-Garris, 2022). This includes countering false narratives and deficit frames that implicitly or explicitly focus on individual behaviours, limitations of parents or children and young people or provider unconscious bias without explicit attention to structural issues (Boyd et al., 2020; Watego et al., 2021; Wray-Lake et al., 2022) and challenging narrow approaches that focus on childhood adversity and either add racial discrimination as simply another form of adversity within cumulative risk scores or ignore it altogether, instead of recognising racism as a fundamental and unique social force that shapes and drives other forms of childhood adversity (Shonkoff et al., 2021). We must find new ways to bring together expertise across disciplines to ensure robust and comprehensive measurement of systemic racism exposure that is age, population and context appropriate, and to harness the best of biomarker and clinical research to ensure outcome measurement and interpretation is biologically and clinically meaningful and ultimately contributes to informing interventions to counter racism and its harmful health effects. Critically, this must be governed by and in authentic partnership with community organisations, children and young people and their families, and researchers from racialised communities (Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, 2020; Wray-Lake et al., 2022).""","Our review organises and synthesises recent evidence on the extent to which racism is associated with health and wellbeing among children and youth, updating the previous systematic review (Priest et al., 2013). We hope this informs future research priorities and motivates strategic action to address systemic racism and its harms for children and youth. The field of racism and child and youth health has substantially grown since the original review, with an almost fourfold increase in the number of studies published. Yet there remains an ongoing need within studies for far more explicit engagement with theoretical frameworks of racism and health, including defining and conceptualising racism and the ways in which racism as a system of oppression impacts child and youth health. While empirical attention to the impacts of systemic, structural and institutional racism on child and youth health has increased in recent years, it still remains relatively small. Overwhelmingly, the field continues to focus on direct interpersonal experiences of racism. Attention to health outcomes beyond mental health and health behaviours, to elucidating the pathways by which racism becomes embodied and biologically expressed during childhood and youth, and to racism's impacts in early and middle childhood also remain outstanding priorities. Physical health and biomarker outcomes have received more attention in recent years though are still less than ten per cent of all studies identified. Our meta-analysis found minimal to moderate positive associations between racism and increased inflammation as measured by CRP and IL-6, higher levels of BMI and obesity, higher levels of systolic blood pressure and salivary cortisol, asthma and somatic symptoms. There were marginal positive associations between racism and increased inflammation measured by TNF-Œ±, higher levels of cortisol, BMI-z score and diastolic blood pressure, with imprecise estimates and wide CIs. We found minimal negative associations of racism with IL-1Œ≤ and IL-8, with imprecise estimates and wide CIs. Together these findings suggest that racism is associated with multiple physiological systems and biological processes in childhood and adolescence. This has implications for health and wellbeing during childhood and adolescence, as well as for future chronic disease risk.Consistent with previous systematic reviews (Benner et al., 2018; Priest et al., 2013), we found that most included studies were conducted in the USA, particularly in urban contexts, suggesting a need for more evidence from other countries and contexts. Critically, only 14% of studies included Indigenous populations, reinforcing calls for far greater attention to the health impacts of racism for Indigenous children and youth as distinct from other racialised groups and as deeply embedded within settler-colonialism (Uink et al., 2022). Although more studies have larger sample sizes (n ‚â• 1000) which can improve statistical power and enable more precise estimates (Fraley and Vazire, 2014), there remains a predominance of convenience sampling, which creates generalisability issues for statistical studies. In this review, more than two-fifths of included studies were longitudinal, double that of the previous review (Priest et al., 2013). This reflects a growing recognition of the need to understand the dynamics of variables over time and the long-term effect of racism on health and wellbeing over the life course.Racism and racial discrimination were formally defined in fewer than two fifths of the studies examined. The explicit use of the term ‚Äòracism‚Äô and the explicit conceptualisations and definitions of racism as systemic and structural, including as the driver of racial discrimination enacted between individuals, is an identified priority for studies of racism and health and for racial ethnic health inequities research despite firm opposition in some scientific contexts (Boyd et al., 2020; Howe et al., 2022; Krieger et al., 2021; Michaels et al., 2023; Wray-Lake et al., 2022; Zambrana and Williams, 2022). Only just over half of the included studies presented the theoretical models, theories, or frameworks underpinning their research. Yet the opportunities to produce more meaningful evidence offered by the improved methodological rigour of the last decade can only go so far without its location in appropriate theory, including those related to racism and health, racialised health inequities and embodiment, and socio-ecological models of child and youth health and development (Javadi et al., 2023; Krieger, 2012; Slopen and Heard-Garris, 2022; Williams and Mohammed, 2013).Our findings that racism is associated with multiple negative physical health and biomarker outcomes are consistent with previous reviews (Cuevas et al., 2020; Lawrence et al., 2022). One narrative review identified associations between discrimination and inflammatory markers including CRP and IL-6, though did not report findings by type of discrimination or inflammatory marker used (Cuevas et al., 2020). A systematic review and meta-analysis of the Everyday Discrimination Scale and biomarker outcomes also found minimal to moderate positive associations between discrimination and elevated CRP though unlike this present review did not find minimal to moderate positive associations between discrimination and IL-6 (Lawrence et al., 2022). This may be related to different exposure measures, age of participants, measurement approaches including plasma or saliva, or other study characteristics. Unlike our meta-analysis findings that found moderate evidence of an association between racism and salivary cortisol, previous reviews have reported a lack of evidence for association between the Everyday Discrimination Scale and cortisol (Lawrence et al., 2022) and between racial discrimination and cortisol (Korous et al., 2017). Consistently across all reviews, including this present one, is the considerable variation in measurement approaches of cortisol and the complexity in measuring discrimination and cortisol. Our findings in relation to systolic blood pressure, weight status, asthma and somatic symptoms are also consistent with evidence among adults that shows the harmful impacts of racism on these outcomes (Paradies et al., 2015) and with evidence regarding the impacts of childhood adversity more generally on these outcomes in childhood and adolescence (Oh et al., 2018; Suglia et al., 2020).While there is variation in the effect sizes and precision across outcome indicators, together the findings across outcomes suggest racism exposure is associated with multiple biological disruptions for children and youth and that these relate to a wide range of physiological processes including immune, endocrine, respiratory and cardiovascular function. This is consistent with conceptual and empirical evidence regarding the highly integrated responses to harmful social and environmental exposures that occur across nervous, endocrine, and immune systems and the short and long term impacts of chronic activation of these systems in childhood (Danese and McEwen, 2012; Shonkoff et al., 2012). For example, increased overweight and obesity risk in response to racism may be related to structural and functional nervous system changes that can lead to behavioural responses such as physical activity levels, eating behaviours, as well as endocrine changes linked to chronic activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis such as increased cortisol and glucocorticoid resistance. Blood pressure increases can be related to dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system. Increased inflammation can also be related to changes in the autonomic nervous system, as well as to weight status, physical activity and dietary quality (Danese and McEwen, 2012; Shonkoff et al., 2012). It is well established that childhood and adolescence are life periods during which these biological systems are especially sensitive to social and environmental influences and that resulting structural changes and physiological disruptions can have lifelong implications (Patton et al., 2016; Shonkoff et al., 2021). Systemic racism fundamentally shapes these social and environmental influences acting as a distinct and substantial threat to the foundations of optimal health and development for children and youth from racialised communities (Shonkoff et al., 2021; Slopen and Heard-Garris, 2022).The variability in the effects of racism across different outcome indicators identified in this review might be attributed to several factors. Methodological differences across studies, including sample size, racism exposure measures, approaches of physical health and biomarker measure and analysis, and analytic approaches including confounder selection and unmeasured covariates, may also account for inconsistencies in the findings. Together with key issues related to racism exposure measurement such as capturing timing, intensity, chronicity, and form of exposure, as well as potential mediating and moderating factors, age at outcome assessment may also explain variability in findings. For example, effects of childhood adversity on inflammation have been shown to differ by age of outcome, with stronger evidence of associations in late childhood compared to mid childhood possibly due to latency periods between exposure and outcome or that current inflammatory biomarkers are not sensitive to chronic inflammation in early life (O'Connor et al., 2020). With only three studies included in the meta-analysis examining moderating or mediating factors between racism and physical health and biomarker outcomes, this is an important area of future work.Outcome measure selection and analytic approach which are also highlighted in previous reviews likely played a role in the variation across findings, particularly for inflammation and cortisol (Cuevas et al., 2020; Korous et al., 2017; Lawrence et al., 2022). Measurement of inflammatory markers in this review spanned saliva and plasma/serum though these may not be comparable with inflammation in saliva and are possibly a poor indicator of systemic (rather than intra-oral) inflammation (Priest et al., 2020). Further, CRP is an acute phase reactant and is considered a less than optimal marker of childhood chronic inflammation (Collier et al., 2019). Cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1Œ≤, and IL-8 also can each be associated with acute and chronic inflammatory responses, both alloimmune (non-self) and auto-immune threats and are associated with different disease states, e.g. IL-6, IL-8 with obesity, TNF-Œ± with depression (Chen et al., 2017). A more promising inflammatory marker for capturing cumulative, chronic inflammation in childhood may be glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA), a nuclear magnetic resonance derived metabolite (Collier et al., 2019) with evidence of associations in childhood with adverse psychosocial exposures (O'Connor et al., 2020). There is also a need to conceptualise and quantify inflammation not as a static phenomenon captured by a single biomarker at one time point, but as a dynamic interaction of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways, and in the context of a persistent immune phenotype (Gamage et al under review; McDade, 2023). The assessment of cortisol varied across saliva, hair and urine samples and included different timing of collection ranging from three or four time points during the day/interview, five times per day for three days, or a single time point. Each of these likely captures different aspects of the physiological stress response (Korous et al., 2017), making meaningful interpretation of these findings difficult.Overall, our review showed that racism is associated with multiple poor physiological systems and biological processes in childhood and adolescence, although evidence remains relatively emergent. Nonetheless, these findings have implications for health and wellbeing during childhood and adolescence, as well as for future chronic disease risk, and begin to elucidate how racism becomes embodied and embedded in early life. Grounded in strong explicit conceptual and theoretical understandings of systemic racism and health combined with socio-ecological models of child and youth development, we must continue to articulate and empirically quantify the profound health harms of racism for children and youth from racialised backgrounds and the contribution of racism to the health inequities they experience (Priest et al., in press; Shonkoff et al., 2021; Slopen and Heard-Garris, 2022). This includes countering false narratives and deficit frames that implicitly or explicitly focus on individual behaviours, limitations of parents or children and young people or provider unconscious bias without explicit attention to structural issues (Boyd et al., 2020; Watego et al., 2021; Wray-Lake et al., 2022) and challenging narrow approaches that focus on childhood adversity and either add racial discrimination as simply another form of adversity within cumulative risk scores or ignore it altogether, instead of recognising racism as a fundamental and unique social force that shapes and drives other forms of childhood adversity (Shonkoff et al., 2021).

Critically, this must be governed by and in authentic partnership with community organisations, children and young people and their families, and researchers from racialised communities (Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, 2020; Wray-Lake et al., 2022).4.1. LimitationsThere were several limitations that should be noted. We only included eligible studies that were published in English from four online databases, which might miss studies published in other languages or the grey literature. We only conducted the meta-analysis for recent studies that focused on physical health or biomarkers. Future research is needed to include other types of health outcomes (e.g., negative mental health, positive mental health, health behaviours) for a better understanding of the full impact of racism on child and youth health. Measurement bias with respect to specific outcome indicators and exposure may also exist in the studies used for the meta-analysis. Due to the small number of studies examining each outcome indicator, different exposure measures were included in each estimation of the pooled correlation coefficients, which may have introduced bias as associations may well vary by exposure measure. In addition, in the process of effect size conversion, formulas used to transform binary effect measures to correlation coefficients were based on approximations. Given that correlation coefficients were used to measure the effect size, results are likely to be subjected to confounding, however the sensitivity analysis with adjusted results indicated that the degree of confounding might be small. The majority of included studies in the meta-analysis used convenience samples which may have introduced selection bias. They were also predominantly conducted in the USA, which may limit the generalisability of our findings to other geographical contexts and populations though it is unlikely with the harmful effects of childhood adversity well established across contexts (Soares et al., 2021). We relied on race and ethnicity reporting by the included study authors and we acknowledge the wide variation in quality of this reporting and the considerable heterogeneity within widely used racial and ethnic categories. Greater attention to collecting and reporting quality race and ethnicity data that is governed and co-produced by, with and for communities remains a global priority.5. ConclusionWe found that racism was associated with a range of negative physical health and biomarker outcomes that relate to multiple physiological systems and biological processes in childhood and adolescence. These findings have implications for health and wellbeing during childhood and adolescence, as well as for future chronic disease risk, and begin to elucidate how systemic racism becomes embodied and embedded in early life. While more work is needed to understand these pathways and mechanisms, this must not be at the expense of, or considered necessary for action to address racism as a fundamental cause of child and youth health. We must move beyond description and enact collective and structural changes through policies, education, advocacy, and partnerships to eliminate racism and create a healthy and equitable future for all children and youth.","BackgroundEvidence of racism's health harms among children and youth is rapidly increasing, though attention to impacts on physical health and biomarker outcomes is more emergent. We performed a systematic review of recent publications to examine the association between racism and health among children and youth, with a meta-analysis of the specific relationships between racism and physical health and biomarkers.MethodsWe conducted a systematic literature search using four databases: Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed, and ERIC. Four inclusion criteria were used to identify eligible studies: (1) exposure was experiences of racism, (2) outcome was health and wellbeing, (3) quantitative methods were used to estimate the association between racism and health outcomes, and (4) the effect size of associations between racism and health and wellbeing was reported for participants aged 0‚Äì24 years. Correlation coefficients were used to report the pooled effect size for each outcome indicator.ResultsThere were 463 eligible studies included in the screening process, with 42 studies focusing on physical health or biomarker outcomes. Random-effects meta-analysis found minimal to moderate positive associations between racism and C-reactive protein, Interleukin 6, body mass index (BMI), obesity, systolic blood pressure, salivary cortisol, asthma, and somatic symptoms. There were marginal positive associations between racism and Tumour Necrosis Factor-Œ±, cortisol collected via saliva, urine and hair, BMI-z score, and diastolic blood pressure, with imprecise estimates and wide confidence intervals.ConclusionsRacism is associated with negative physical health and biomarker outcomes that relate to multiple physiological systems and biological processes in childhood and adolescence. This has implications for health and wellbeing during childhood and adolescence and future chronic disease risk. Collective and structural changes to eliminate racism and create a healthy and equitable future for all children and youth are urgently required.","3",0,"3","Political",2,1
211,65,"Kuziemko, I., Norton, M. I., Saez, E., & Stantcheva, S. (2015). How elastic are preferences for redistribution? Evidence from randomized survey experiments. American Economic Review, 105(4), 1478-1508.","4.2.1 Does government distrust explain limited treatment effects?Discussion. Decreasing respondents‚Äô trust in government appears to have a strong, negative effect on support for direct government transfers. As further support for the trust mechanism, the treatment has no effect on support for the minimum wage, which is an indirect transfer that does not involve the government receiving and redistributing tax dollars. Recall also that the omnibus treatment failed to increase support for direct transfer programs (the EITC and food stamps) but did increase support for the minimum wage. As Table 9 shows that support for the minimum wage appears unaffected by changes in trust, trust emerges as a plausible mediating variable that can explain the pattern of results for the omnibus treatment.4.2.2 Emotional versus factual appealsDiscussion. As readers can verify by taking the surveys themselves, the omnibus treatment and this ‚Äúemotional‚Äù follow-up are very different in spirit. The omnibus treatment focused largely on the top one percent and was more factual in nature, whereas the followup treatment focused on the disadvantaged and sought to create empathy both with our ‚Äúput yourselves in their shoes‚Äù exercise as well as photographs of low-income families. Despite these stark differences, the results are very similar. It is relatively easy for treatments to affect how much individuals are ‚Äúconcerned‚Äù with any issue, but much harder to increase their support for policies that would seem directly related to addressing said issues. Our final follow-up survey attempts to make the connection to policy measures more explicit.4.2.3 Connecting ‚Äúconcerns‚Äù with policy measuresDiscussion. While this treatment indeed moved policy preferences, it is worth noting its highly explicit nature. After completing an exercise where they contemplated the budget constraints of a low-income family, respondents were shown in concrete terms how a government program helps such a household make ends meet. Even then, while support for many poverty-related programs significantly increased, the largest effect remains the minimum wage, an indirect transfer program. Moreover, the treatment does not have a consistent effect in terms of inducing treatment participants to desire higher taxes (even if only on the wealthy) to pay for these programs.Taken together, the results from these three follow-up surveys suggest the difficulty in moving most policy preferences. While concern for an issue is highly elastic to information, translating this concern into a change in policy preference appears very difficult, with the consistent exception of the estate tax.5 ConclusionThe standard median-voter model predicts that support for redistribution should increase with income inequality, yet there has been little evidence of greater demand for redistribution over the past thirty years in the United States‚Äîdespite historic increases in income concentration. A possible explanation is that people are unaware of the increase in inequality, such that greater information would substantially move redistributive preferences. We gather over 10,000 observations using Amazon‚Äôs Mechanical Turk to conduct a series of survey experiments to extensively explore this hypothesis.Our results suggest that, generally, greater information can increase respondents‚Äô sense of concern about an issue, but not necessarily their support for policies that might ameliorate it. Information about income inequality and poverty has only a limited (and typically statistically insignificant) tendency to increase support for higher income taxes on the well-off or transfer programs for the disadvantaged.We present evidence that extreme distrust of government appears to explain part of this null effect. First, trust in government is very low in our sample, as it currently is among Americans more generally. Second, many of our treatments appear to further reduce thisalready low level of trust. Third, and most novel relative to the literature, we show that decreasing trust has a causal effect on diminishing support for redistribution. We develop a prime that reduces trust in government without significantly moving respondents‚Äô concern for inequality and poverty: respondents exposed to this prime significantly reduce their support for programs that involve the government directly redistributing tax dollars, while increasing their support for non-governmental solutions such as private charity.Only when we explicitly show individuals the concrete effects of government poverty policies do we observe consistent, statistically significant increases in support for such policies.41 Even so, such effects are small, and are largest for indirect transfer programs such as the minimum wage that do not involve the government collecting and redistributing tax dollars.Future work might further probe the connection between government trust and policy preferences. Underlying mistrust might help to explain the reluctance to support policies that would seem to be in the majority‚Äôs self-interest. Relatedly, distrust could explain whyminimum wage increases typically enjoy 70-80 percent support in surveys. Many economists assume that respondents simply misunderstand the incidence of the minimum wage. Instead, it might be the case that they view the minimum wage as imperfect, but better than other redistributive policies that involve sending money to Washington.42 In future work, it would be valuable to test whether treatments that increase trust in the government also increase support for redistributive policies.As we extensively document, the estate tax is the exception to the generally small effects of information on policy: even a four-sentence description providing information on its incidence significantly increases support for the policy. At least part of this effect appears due to vast misinformation‚Äîmany respondents both in our survey and past work on the estate tax believe a majority of families are subject to it, whereas the actual share is 0.1 percent.It remains an open question if misinformation fully explains the difference. For example, Americans might view the moral claims to inheritance versus income differently. If the goal of the estate tax is to prevent the self-perpetuation of extreme wealth, then respondents might still support it even if, say, the government merely burns the money it collects. Therefore, low levels of trust in government may not inhibit support for the estate tax as much as for other policies where efficiency is a more salient goal. Independent of the origin of the treatment effect, the large elasticity of support for the estate tax in response to basic informationthat we and past work have documented is highly policy-relevant, given the recent rise in inheritance flows in many developed countries.43Randomized online surveys are a powerful and convenient tool for studying the effects of information treatments on attitudes and behaviors, one we imagine can be used to extend the results we have documented. The tool is powerful because it can reach large samples of U.S. residents (in the thousands) at fairly low cost ($1-$2 per respondent). It is convenient because, using widely available software, online surveys are now very easy to design. Hence, it becomes more feasible to explore mechanisms behind results. For example, we were able to easily design companion experiments to test mechanisms potentially underlying the effectsin our original, omnibus treatment. Therefore, in contrast to field experiments which are very costly to set-up and replicate, online survey experiments lend themselves naturally to conducting series of experiments where results from an initial experiment lead to new experiments to cast light on potential mechanisms.Such flexibility will allow researchers to gain a more nuanced understanding of redistributive preferences. While projections are by nature uncertain, the U.S. government is expected to face a long-run fiscal imbalance, largely due to the aging of the population and rising health care costs.44 European countries face similar challenges. The distributional effects of any future fiscal rebalancing‚Äîraising taxes, cutting spending, or both‚Äîwill depend in large part on voters‚Äô redistributive preferences, how strongly they hold them, and whether and how they act on them. As such, these questions are of first-order importance in public economics. We believe that the methodology we employed in this paper can be used in future research to better understand how individuals‚Äô redistributive preferences are formed and shaped.","We analyze randomized online survey experiments providing interactive, customized information on US income inequality, the link between top income tax rates and economic growth, and the estate tax. The treatment has large effects on views about inequality but only slightly moves tax and transfer policy preferences. An exception is the estate tax‚Äîinforming respondents of the small share of decedents who pay it doubles support for it. The small effects for all other policies can be partially explained by respondents‚Äô low trust in government and a disconnect between concerns about social issues and the public policies meant to address them.

212,65,"Imas, A., Sadoff, S., & Samek, A. (2017). Do people anticipate loss aversion?. Management Science, 63(5), 1271-1284.","Our results demonstrate that, as predicted, individuals do exert higher effort under loss contracts; however, in contrast to the theory, they prefer loss contracts to gain contracts. Further, we find evidence that those who are most sensitive to losses are also the ones who are most likely to select into loss contracts. That is, the most lossaverse individuals both work harder and have the highest WTP for loss contracts. As discussed in Section 2, the greater the upward distortion in effort under loss contracts (relative to gain contracts), the larger the utility costs experienced under loss contracts. Why then would people want to enter a contract that induces them to work ‚Äútoo hard‚Äù by imposing the pain of potential losses?
 We suggest that one possible mechanism driving our results is that individuals select into loss contracts as a commitment device because of a dynamic inconsistency in their preferences. In the workplace, dynamic inconsistency can take the following form: individuals may have an ex ante preference for working hard and maximizing their chance of earning a performance bonus, but when it comes time to exert the actual effort, their preferences reverse‚Äîthey shirk and fail to earn the incentive (Kaur et al. 2010, Cadena et al. 2011).13 If individuals are sophisticated about their dynamic inconsistency, they may anticipate this preference reversal and value commitment devices that impose additional costs on shirking (Laibson 1997, O‚ÄôDonoghue and Rabin 1999).
In particular, a potential mechanism for favoring a loss contract is that individuals with dynamically inconsistent preferences may recognize that they will work harder under the threat of potential losses than they would for potential gains and select into loss contracts in order to commit their future selves to improved performance and higher expected earnings. As such, in line with our empirical results but in contrast to the predictions of the standard behavioral model, individuals who are loss averse should both work harder under loss contracts and be more willing to enter into them.14
Although our results are consistent with people‚Äôs anticipation of loss aversion as a commitment device, we cannot rule out alternative mechanisms. For example, the anticipation of obtaining the reward sooner under the loss contract than the gain contract may cause some to perceive the status quo as owning the shirt. As such, individuals offered the loss contract would be more likely to select the contract to retain the possibility of keeping the reward. De Quidt (2014) also explores potential explanations for the observed preference for loss contracts. He compares loss-framed contracts that offer a high base pay with a potential penalty to gain-framed contracts that offer a low base pay with a potential bonus. Although the expected pay‚Äî i.e., base pay net of the potential bonus or penalty‚Äîis equivalent in both contracts, De Quidt concludes that the higher stated base pay in the loss-framed contracts is more salient to workers than the expected pay, which they must calculate themselves. Thus, in De Quidt‚Äôs setting, higher entry rates into loss-framed contracts compared with gain-framed contracts may be driven by differences in salience across contracts. However, this is less relevant in our context, where we offer a single fixed reward and vary only the timing of when workers will receive it.
Our study informs a growing literature demonstrating that people are willing to take up commitment contracts in contexts where dynamic inconsistencies in preferences exist (Ashraf et al. 2006; Augenblick et al. 2015; Hsiaw 2013, 2015; Sadoff et al. 2015).15 These contracts often include a loss component such as penalties for failing to meet performance targets (Kaur et al. 2015, Royer et al. 2015, Gin√© et al. 2012, Schwartz et al. 2014, John et al. 2011). However, to our knowledge, little research has explicitly examined the role of loss aversion in demand for commitment.16 More work is needed to understand how loss aversion affects preferences between contracts as well as its possible role in the take up of commitment devices.7. Conclusion Understanding the extent to which there are trade-offs between employee productivity and employee preferences is critical for managers and organizations considering the use of loss contracts. Standard behavioral models predict that such a trade-off exists: employees will work harder under loss contracts than they will under equivalent gain contracts, but, anticipating loss aversion, employees will select into gain contracts rather than loss contracts. Despite growing interest in the use of loss contracts, little is known about the extent to which these trade-offs exist in practice. This study is among the first to examine both performance and preferences for gain versus loss contracts. We find that although individuals work harder under a loss contract than they do under a gain contract (as predicted), they prefer the former to the latter (in contrast to the standard prediction). We also find heterogeneity in susceptibility to loss contracts. More loss-averse individuals exert higher effort and have a greater preference for loss contracts. This suggests that firms may not need to pay a premium to persuade potential employees to work under loss contracts and that offering such contracts could be beneficial for all parties. Our results also inform theory. Whether people anticipate loss aversion and how they react to it has important implications for modeling the decision making of individuals with reference-dependent preferences. Our study is among the first to explore the general question of whether people anticipate loss aversion. We find evidence that people do anticipate loss aversion, but rather than deterring them as predicted under standard models of reference dependence, greater loss aversion may make the preference for loss contracts stronger. Related work also finds evidence that people do not anticipate loss aversion as predicted by standard behavioral models with rational expectations. In the context of eliciting willingness to pay and willingness to accept values for a mug, Loewenstein and Adler (1995) and Van Boven et al. (2000) find evidence that prior to being endowed, subjects underestimate their willingness to accept. Examining preferences and selection effects is crucial for applying behavioral insights in management and policy more broadly. For example, several studies find that people are reluctant to realize losses on assets (Barberis 2013). If this is the case, whether and how people anticipate such behavior is critical for understanding their trading decisions. The anticipation of future preferences has been explored in other areas, such as models of rational addiction (Becker and Murphy 1988), projection bias (Loewenstein et al. 2003), and time preferences (Laibson 1997, O‚ÄôDonoghue and Rabin 1999). These models allow us to evaluate the extent to which we can view individuals‚Äô decision making as rational and the extent to which people may be making optimization mistakes. Further studies in the lab and field can help shed light on this important yet underexplored question in the context of referencedependent preferences.","There is growing interest in the use of loss contracts that offer performance incentives as up-front payments that employees can lose. Standard behavioral models predict a trade-off in the use of loss contracts: employees will work harder under loss contracts than under gain contracts, but, anticipating loss aversion, they will prefer gain contracts to loss contracts. In a series of experiments, we test these predictions by measuring performance and preferences for payoff-equivalent gain and loss contracts. We find that people indeed work harder under loss than gain contracts, as the theory predicts. Surprisingly, rather than a preference for the gain contract, we find that people actually prefer loss contracts. In exploring mechanisms for our results, we find suggestive evidence that people do anticipate loss aversion but select into loss contracts as a commitment device to improve performance, using one bias, loss aversion, to address another, dynamic inconsistency.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,0

Management Science, 67(1), 8-21.","One of the unprecedented global economic move-ments among Ô¨Årms in the past 50 years is theirnewfound appreciation for their own social respon-sibility. Indeed, it is difÔ¨Åcult to Ô¨Ånd more than ahandful of leading Ô¨Årms that do not have a CSRprogram, and most have entire departments devotedto CSR. Although this change in landscape is notdebatable, what is noteworthy is the dearth of em-pirical evidence on the consequences of such efforts.We make a contribution in this area using a naturalÔ¨Åeld experiment with over 1,500 workers to explorethe relationship between CSR and employee mis-behavior. Our empirical analyses suggest that CSRcan actually increase worker misbehavior. Workerswho received our CSR message were more likely tocheat and cheated more intensively than those in thebaseline group. The overall data patterns are con-sistent with a model of moral licensing. We Ô¨Ånd thepropensity for misbehavior to be the highest whenwe frame CSR as a prosocial act on behalf of workerscompared with when the CSR is on behalf of Ô¨Årms.That is, when we communicated CSR as a benevolentact from the employer, CSR does not signiÔ¨Åcantlyimpact misbehavior compared with the control group.This result is consistent with the Ô¨Åndings of Kouchakiand Jami (2018), who document a higher level ofmoral licensing when consumers are exposed to aCSR message that praises the consumers comparedwith a message that praises the company for CSR. Although we view our results as one of the Ô¨Årst tests of moral licensing in a natural Ô¨Åeld experiment, an-other factor that distinguishes our work from pre-vious evidence on moral licensing is the sample size.In a meta-analysis of 91 studies in moral licensing,Blanken et al. (2015) Ô¨Ånd the sample size in thesestudies to be relatively small, with an average of only81.3 participants per study. With a sample size ofover 1,500 subjects, our experiment is one of thelargest-scale ones in which moral licensing has beendocumented. Beyond these advances, our Ô¨Åndings have impor-tant implications for managers and practitioners onthe use of CSR as a tool for motivating workers.Previous studies that explored the supply-side effectof CSR have focused on the effect on productivity.Our results suggest that in an environment whereworker misbehavior is costly to the employer, CSRmay have counterproductive effects by increasingmisbehavior though moral licensing. Of course, thedegree to which CSR generates moral licensing alsodepends on how it is communicated to workers. Because moral licensing works by exploiting imageconcerns, we believe that framing CSR in a way thattriggers worker self-image is more likely to increasemisbehavior on the job.Moreover, our Ô¨Åndings provide important insightswith regard to the decision that an employer faces inallocating his or her limited Ô¨Ånancial resources be-tween private incentives (wage) and social incentivesin the form of CSR. Combing the previously docu-mented effect of wage in reducing worker misbe-havior (Ockenfels et al. 2015, Flory et al. 2016) withour Ô¨Ånding that CSR increases misbehavior, one caninfer that an employer who seeks to minimize workermisconduct would be better off by spending his orher Ô¨Ånancial resources in the form of private incen-tives (wage). This is indeed what our complementarytreatments reveal. As we substitute wage with CSR,the share of workers who misbehave and the averageintensity of cheating per worker increase. Appendix Dpresents these Ô¨Åndings in more detail.We believe that our Ô¨Åndings are likely to be gen-eralizable to the dimensions of a worker‚Äôs counter-productive behavior that damages his or her self-image. For CSR to increase misbehavior via morallicensing, engaging in misbehavior should inducesome form of guilt in the worker. In other words, anindividual does not need a license to misbehave if thatbehavior does not provoke a feeling of guilt and doesnot damage his or her self-image. Therefore, we ex-pect counterproductive workplace behaviors that areperceived to be unethical (such as stealing or lying) tobe more likely to increase with CSR.We recognize a number of limitations in the extentto which our Ô¨Åndings are generalizable to other set-tings that we believe future research should seek toaddress. First, to evaluate whether CSR generatespositive supply-side effects, a Ô¨Årm needs to take intoaccount two major determinants: The selection effectand the treatment effect. The selection effect speaksto whether a Ô¨Årm who engages in CSR attracts bet-ter (more productive/ethical) workers, whereas thetreatment effect refers to the impact of adding CSRincentives for an existing pool of workers. Ourtreatments shut down the selection effect by design,and our results reÔ¨Çect the pure treatment effect ofCSR. Therefore, our Ô¨Åndings will be most relevant foran employer with an existing pool of workers who istrying to determine whether to invest in CSR. It thusremains an open question whether, in an environmentwith the possibility of selection, Ô¨Årms that engage inCSR would attract more ethical workers, or theywould attract less honest workers who use the moral-licensing effect of CSR to justify their misconduct.Second, our experiment was conducted as a one-shotinteraction with contingent workers who have limitedconnection to their employer. The temporary nature of the relationship of employers with contingent workerssurely affects the extent to which workers identify withthe organization for which they work and, consequently,with the employer‚Äôs CSR identity. Thus, the extent to whichour Ô¨Åndings generalize in longer-term employment re-lationships remains to be explored in future research.Finally, although our evidence is consistent withmoral licensing, because the difference in cheatingacross the two framings of CSR is not large enough tobe signiÔ¨Åcant at the conventional levels, we can onlytake it as suggestive evidence for moral licensing.Indeed, CSR may induce negative supply-side effectsvia other channels as well. For example, CSR mightinduce negative reciprocity because of the perceivedintention of the employer to use CSR instrumentally.As discussed in Cassar and Meier (2017), the efÔ¨Åcacyof social incentives in inducing positive reciproc-ity might depend on the perceived intention of theemployer, and if perceived as used instrumentallyto maximize proÔ¨Åts, prosocial incentives may back-Ô¨Åre. Alternatively, the CSR message might signal anemployer‚Äôs benevolence. CSR can increase misbe-havior if workers believe that the employer‚Äôs be-nevolence is negatively correlated with possible pun-ishments in case misbehavior is detected. Finally, onecould argue that spending resources on social causesmight simply upset workers (and induce negativereciprocity) because it might imply that fewer re-sources will be allocated for wage payment. We donot believe such a concern plays a major role in oursetting because (1) a Ô¨Årm that invests in CSR can keepwage Ô¨Åxed and have reduced proÔ¨Åts, and (2) ourinstructions mitigated such concerns by clearly stat-ing a worker‚Äôs payoff in the contract. Although we donot believe that such effects play a key role in gen-erating our results, we cannot completely rule outtheir presence in our experiment.","This paper uses a natural field experiment to connect corporate social responsibility (CSR) to an important but often neglected behavior: employee misconduct and shirking. Through employing more than 1,500 workers, we find that our use of CSR increases employee misbehavior‚Äî24% more employees act detrimentally toward our firm by shirking on their primary job duties when we introduce CSR. Observed data patterns across the treatments are consonant with a model of ‚Äúmoral licensing,‚Äù whereby the ‚Äúdoing good‚Äù nature of CSR induces workers to misbehave on another dimension that is harmful to the firm.","6",0,"6","Apolitical",5,0

Journal of Political Economy, 112(S1), S164-S187.","The initial experience with the SMarT plan has been quite successful. Many of the people who were offered the plan elected to use it, and a majority of the people who joined the SMarT plan stuck with it. Consequently, in the first implementation, for which we have data for four annual raises, SMarT participants almost quadrupled their saving rates. Of course, one reason why the SMarT plan works so well is that inertia is so powerful. Once people enroll in the plan, few opt out. The SMarT plan takes precisely the same behavioral tendency that induces people to postpone saving indefinitely (i.e., procrastination and inertia) and puts it to use. As the financial consultant involved in the first implementation has noted, in hindsight it would have been better to offer the SMarT plan to all participants, even those who were willing to make their initial savings increase more than the first step of the SMarT plan. Very few of these eager savers ever got around to changing their savings allocations again, whereas the SMarT plan participants were already saving more than they were after just 16 months (see table 2).

Some economists have criticized practices such as automatic enrollment and the SMarT plan on the grounds that they are paternalistic, a term that is not meant to be complimentary. We agree that these plans are paternalistic, but since no coercion is involved, they constitute what Sunstein and Thaler (2003) call ‚Äúlibertarian paternalism.‚Äù Libertarian paternalism is a philosophy that advocates designing institutions that help people make better decisions but do not impinge on their freedom to choose. Automatic enrollment is a good example of libertarian paternalism. Notice that firms must decide what happens to employees who take no action with respect to joining the savings plan. Traditionally, employees who did nothing were presumed not to want to join the plan.   

Automatic enrollment simply changes that presumption. Neither arrangement infringes on choice (so both are libertarian), but one produces higher savings rates and so might be considered paternalistic. The SMarT plan is even less intrusive than automatic enrollment since participants have to take some action to enroll, and it is even more successful at getting people to save. So, we plead guilty to the charge of trying to be paternalistic, but since we are striving for libertarian paternalism, we do not think that it should be considered objectionable.

Finally, we hope that this study serves as a valid reply to two frequent critiques of behavioral economics: the reliance on laboratory studies using modest stakes and the ex post explanation of anomalous facts, drawing on what is alleged to be a limitless store of potential behavioral explanations. Here, we have used behavioral principles to design a plan to increase savings rates and tested the idea in the real world.","As firms switch from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans, employees bear more responsibility for making decisions about how much to save. The employees who fail to join the plan, or who participate at a very low level, appear to be saving at less than the predicted lifecycle savings rates.  Behavioral explanations for this behavior stress bounded rationality and self-control and suggest that at least some of the low-saving households are making a mistake, and would welcome aid in making decisions about their saving.  In this paper, we propose such a prescriptive savings program, called Save More TomorrowTM (hereafter, the SMarT program). The essence of the program is straightforward: people commit in advance to allocate a portion of their future salary increases toward retirement savings.  We report evidence on the first three implementations of the SMarT program. Our key findings, from the first implementation, which has been in place for four annual raises, are the following:  (1)  a high proportion (78 percent) of those offered the plan joined; (2) the vast majority of those enrolled in the SMarT plan (80 percent) remained in it through the fourth pay raise; and (3) the average saving rates for SMarT program participants increased from 3.5 percent to 13.6 percent over the course of 40 months. The results suggest that behavioral economics can be used to design effective prescriptive programs for important economic decisions.","4",0,"4","Political",3,0

Management Science, 60(10), 2563-2582.","Across three field studies, we find evidence of a fresh start effect whereby people exhibit a higher likelihood of engaging in aspirational behaviors following temporal landmarks such as the initiation of new calendar cycles (e.g., the start of a new week, month, year, or academic semester), holidays, and birthdays. We analyze a broad set of aspirational activities: web searches for the term ‚Äúdiet,‚Äù gym attendance, and the creation of commitment contracts to support a wide range of different goals. The effects we document are large in magnitude, suggesting that the fresh start effect has meaningful implications for individual and societal welfare.The fresh start effect documented in this paper is consistent with two psychological processes we proposed to parsimoniously explain it. First, new mental accounting periods as demarcated by temporal landmarks psychologically distance the current self from past imperfections, propelling people to behave in line with their new, positive self-image. Second, temporal landmarks interrupt attention to day-to-day minutiae, causing people to take a big-picture view of their lives and thus focus more on achieving their goals. This paper relies on field data to demonstrate the existence of the fresh start effect, but it does not offer a direct test of the underlying mechanisms responsible for this effect. Thus, future research documenting the psychological processes that underlie the fresh start effect would be extremely valuable. In the next section, we discuss and provide evidence that helps rule out a number of uninteresting alternative explanations for our findings.6.1. Alternative ExplanationsOne concern with our findings is that people tend to engage in activities prior to (or during) temporal landmarks that harm goal pursuit, and our findings might simply reflect a rational attempt to offset these bad behaviors after temporal landmarks. For example, the fresh start effect could simply be attributed to the desire to counteract excessive caloric intake associated with weekends and holidays. We can rule out this alternative explanation in a number of ways. First, in Study 3, we rule out this alternative explanation by showing that following temporal landmarks, commitment contracts for health-irrelevant goals increase. Second, when we remove holidays that are particular excuses for gluttony (Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas), we still find a significant uptick in aspirational behaviors immediately following holidays and school breaks. Third, this compensatory alternative explanation cannot account for our consistent finding that aspirational behaviors are more intense at the start of the month than at the close of a month since neither the start nor the end of a new month is associated with increased indulgence. Finally, this alternative explanation suggests that engagement in aspirational activities would be significantly lower right before temporal landmarks than on other days. We can directly test whether this is the case by exploring whether people are indeed significantly less likely to engage in aspirational behaviors immediately before temporal landmarks than on other days across our three field data sets.Although we hypothesize that temporal landmarks elevate the frequency of aspirational behaviors and that these effects weaken as people perceive temporal landmarks to be further away, our hypothesis does not predict that engagement in aspirational behaviors will be significantly lower in the short period immediately preceding (or during) a temporal landmark than on any other, typical day. Therefore, we created indicator variables for weekends, the last seven days of each month, the last seven days of each year, the seven days preceding the first workday after each federal holiday (Studies 1 and 3), the seven days preceding the first school day after each school break (Study 2), the seven days preceding each semester‚Äôs start (Study 2), and the seven days immediately before and including a person‚Äôs birthday (Studies 2 and 3). We then added these additional predictor variables to our primary regression models (Models 1 and 6‚Äì10). If our findings were simply attributable to reduced engagement in aspirational behaviors prior to temporal landmarks, we would expect the coefficients on these new predictor variables to be significant and negative. In fact, among 29 new predictor variables across six regression models, only three predictor variables have a significant, negative coefficient at the 5% level, which is not significantly more than the number that would be expected by chance. In addition, the inclusion of these predictor variables does not qualitatively change the coefficients on our primary predictor variables, which remain essentially the same in terms of magnitude and statistical significance. Therefore, it is unlikely that our findings are solely driven by people‚Äôs reduced engagement in aspirational behaviors prior to temporal landmarks.Another alternative explanation for our findings is that people do not have enough time and energy to tackle their goals before temporal landmarks and thus put off aspirational behaviors until after temporal landmarks have passed. Such an alternative account suggests that the period before a temporal landmark is not a good time to initiate goal pursuit and thus should be associated with a significant dip in the frequency of aspirational behaviors, but the analyses described above show that this is not the case. Further, although it is likely that the arrivals of some new mental accounting periods (e.g., following a wedding or a job change) are accompanied by more free time to tackle goals than the windows preceding them, people do not typically have more free time to pursue aspirational activities following most of the types of temporal landmarks studied in this paper (e.g., the beginning of a new week, the beginning of a new month, the first workday after a holiday, or during the first few months following a birthday) than before these temporal landmarks (e.g., on the weekend, at the end of the month, before or during a holiday, or in the few months preceding a birthday). To further address this alternative explanation, however, we recruited 53 participants online from Amazon‚Äôs Mechanical Turk to participate in a survey about daily activities. They were first asked to list three activities that they had the tendency to put off doing until a future date when they thought they would have more time and energy. Next, participants were asked to select the subset of activities from their list that were not aspirational (see Appendix F in the electronic companion for the exact questions). A research assistant removed activities that fit our definition of ‚Äúaspirational‚Äù and then identified the most frequently listed activity that participants tended to put off doing and that was not aspirational in nature: ‚Äúlaundry.‚Äù Following the procedures described in Study 1, we downloaded daily Google search volume for this word from January 1, 2004, to June 30, 2012. We neither predict nor find that searches for ‚Äúlaundry‚Äù systematically increase following the temporal landmarks examined in Model 1 (see Model 4 in Table 1), suggesting that temporal landmarks do not simply increase the interest in all types of activities that require planning, time, and energy.There are several other potential explanations for the documented fresh start effect besides the psychological processes we propose that can be ruled out. First, it could be argued that people generally embrace all types of new activities at the beginning of new cycles. Study 3 helps address this alternative account by showing that the fresh start effect is not confined to the adoption of new habits. For example, temporal landmarks are followed by an increase in the number of commitment contracts created for smoking cessation, an aspirational behavior that disrupts an existing habit (see Table 5). To further address this alternative account, we recruited another 49 participants online from Amazon‚Äôs Mechanical Turk to list three ‚Äúnew‚Äù activities that they had never engaged in before but would consider pursuing in the future. As in the survey we described above, we again asked participants to indicate the subset of activities on their list that were not aspirational (see Appendix F in the electronic companion for the exact questions) and asked a research assistant to remove activities that fit our definition of ‚Äúaspirational.‚Äù ‚ÄúGardening‚Äù was the most frequently listed ‚Äúnew‚Äù activity that was not aspirational in nature. We did not find that Google searches for ‚Äúgardening‚Äù systematically increase following the temporal landmarks examined in Study 1 (see Model 5 in Table 1), suggesting that temporal landmarks do not induce increased engagement in all types of new activities.It is also important to note that some temporal landmarks, particularly personally meaningful life events (e.g., a wedding, a job change) tend to alter one‚Äôs surroundings and daily routines, which in turn trigger certain habitual actions. Past research has shown that altering one‚Äôs surroundings and routines can lead to behavior change (Wood et al. 2005). For example, a move to a new residence may promote a healthy lifestyle because recurring stimuli that cue old, unhealthy habits no longer exist (e.g., a favorite bakery is now far away). Alternatively, a move to a new residence may promote an unhealthy lifestyle because a favorite salad shop is no longer nearby and instead an ice cream parlor is just down the street. There are several reasons why we believe we can rule out this explanation for our findings. First, although many temporal landmarks do disrupt routines, many of those we study (e.g., the start of a new week/month, the celebration of a birthday) do not typically alter routines significantly. In fact, weekly and monthly cycles may actually reinforce routines. Second, this past research on habit disruption does not clearly predict whether contextual shifts that may be induced by certain types of temporal landmarks will lead to increases in aspirational or harmful behaviors. In fact, there is evidence that routine changes can disrupt beneficial habits such as reading the newspaper (Wood et al. 2005). Thus, past research on routines and habit formation does not seem likely to explain the fresh start effect detected in this paper.It could be argued that some temporal landmarks associated with relaxation, such as weekends and holidays, might replenish self-regulatory resources, restoring the self-control that people need to tackle aspirational behaviors (Baumeister et al. 1998). Though repletion could contribute to the elevated motivation to pursue goals that we detect following weekends and holidays and strengthen the impact of the psychological processes highlighted in ¬ß2, this account cannot explain why people choose to engage in aspirational activities at a higher rate following the start of a new month or immediately following a birthday. Also, more nuanced analyses of our field data suggest that the observed fresh start effect is unlikely to be solely driven by changes in self-regulatory resources. Specifically, this alternative account predicts that the frequency of aspirational behaviors should be higher on Saturday and Sunday than Friday because having a day off from work or school is relaxing. However, eight regression models where we replace days since the start of the week with six indicator variables‚Äîone for each day of the week from Tuesday to Sunday (with Monday omitted)‚Äîprovide no consistent evidence that Friday is associated with lower engagement in aspirational behaviors than either Saturday or Sunday (see Models A1, A6‚ÄìA8, and A9‚ÄìA12 in Appendices C, D, and E, respectively, of the electronic companion). In concurrent research exploring the mechanism underlying the fresh start effect through laboratory experiments, Dai et al. (2014) show that people are more motivated to pursue aspirational behaviors following more psychologically meaningful temporal landmarks (e.g., a meaningful birthday or job change) than objectively commensurate but less psychologically meaningful temporal landmarks (e.g., a typical birthday or job change). These findings help rule out relaxation as the sole explanation for the fresh start effect because psychologically meaningful temporal landmarks would not be expected to provide greater opportunities for relaxation than would objectively identical but less meaningful landmarks.6.2. ImplicationsThe fresh start effect has significant practical implications for individual decision makers, managers, and policy makers. First, individuals can not only take advantage of their fresh start feelings at naturally arising temporal landmarks to follow through on good intentions, but they may also be able to construct fresh starts themselves by strategically ‚Äúcreating‚Äù turning points in their personal histories, such as moving to a new residence to start over (a previously named phenomenon called ‚Äúrelocation therapy‚Äù; Kaufman 2013). Second, our findings suggest new ways in which people may be effectively ‚Äúnudged‚Äù (Thaler and Sunstein 2008) to begin pursuing their aspirations. For example, messages designed to promote aspirational behaviors may be most impactful at fresh start moments (e.g., the beginning of a new month, right after holidays) when message recipients will be more interested in striving to achieve their long-term goals, as shown in this paper. Further, marketers of products designed to help people attain desirable objectives (e.g., retirement counseling services, gym memberships, online education programs) may best appeal to consumers‚Äô desires for self-improvement by advertising at fresh start moments.Another implication of this research is that framing certain days as opportunities for a fresh start (e.g., birthdays, the start of a new week/month/year, etc.) may help people make choices that maximize their odds of achieving their aspirations. For example, employers could potentially reframe transition points in the workplace (e.g., a desk move or a return from vacation) to increase the adoption of aspirational activities (e.g., attending training workshops or onsite biometric screenings).An important question related to the practical implications of fresh start effects is how long fresh start feelings persist following the incidence of a temporal landmark. Plots (see Appendix G in the electronic companion) suggest that the elevated motivation we document in this paper spikes on the first workday after a federal holiday and declines rapidly thereafter, whereas motivation wears off much more gradually over the course of each week, month, year, and semester. However, it is worth noting that even fleeting fresh start feelings following temporal landmarks can potentially be valuable for at least two reasons. First, the abundance of fresh start opportunities throughout the year offers repeated chances for people to attempt positive self-change, so even if they initially fail, they may subsequently succeed (Polivy and Herman 2002). Second, transient increases in motivation may be sufficient to help people fulfill important one-shot goals such as receiving a medical test or signing up for a 401(k) account with monthly payroll deductions. In this paper, we primarily study aspirational behaviors where the end goal requires engaging in a series of goal-directed actions (e.g., dieting, exercising, committing to a personal goal). It would be valuable for future research to examine the extent to which temporal landmarks can spur aspirational behaviors that only require a single action (e.g., getting a vaccine, donating to a charity).6.3. Limitations and Future DirectionsThe empirical evidence presented in this paper primarily focuses on temporal landmarks associated with socially constructed timetables (including the yearly calendar, work calendar, and academic calendar). Birthdays are the one exception and example of personally relevant temporal landmarks studied here. Further, we focus on the Gregorian calendar given its relevance to the settings studied. Future research exploring and comparing a broader set of temporal landmarks, including temporal landmarks on different calendars (e.g., the Chinese New Year, the Jewish New Year) as well as additional personal landmarks (e.g., religious conversions, relocations, job changes, etc.) would be valuable. We expect that the fresh start effect likely extends to all temporal landmarks, not only those examined in this paper, though certain types of temporal landmarks may produce stronger effects than others (Dai et al. 2014).In addition, the temporal landmarks highlighted here are all associated with either neutral or positive experiences. Temporal landmarks of negative valence (e.g., a divorce, the death of a family member) may not immediately increase motivation to pursue aspirations if people need to first cope with stressful experiences (Cohen and Hoberman 1983). It would be valuable for future research to explore whether the fresh start effect extends to temporal landmarks stained by negative emotions such as grief, anger, and stress.Our findings raise a number of other questions worthy of exploration. One such question is how the anticipation of a temporal landmark affects behavior. Some recent work suggests that people might feel less compelled to begin pursuing their goals when upcoming landmark events are highlighted because the future self (who will benefit from goal pursuit) feels more disconnected from the current self (Bartels and Rips 2010, Bartels and Urminsky 2011, Tu and Soman 2014). On the other hand, Peetz and Wilson (2013) contend that when an intervening landmark event and a future desirable state are both made salient, the discrepancy between the current self and the future, desired self is highlighted, which motivates beneficial behaviors. Another possibility is that people may use upcoming temporal landmarks as self-imposed deadlines and attempt to bring ongoing goals to closure by these deadlines (e.g., finish reading a book, complete an assignment). Our research suggests two other possible effects of anticipating an upcoming temporal landmark. First, anticipated temporal landmarks might liberate people to make goal-incongruent choices if they anticipate wiping the slate clean after an upcoming temporal landmark (Zhang et al. 2007). Second, if a decision maker foresees that a better opportunity to pursue her aspirations will arise following an impending temporal landmark (e.g., after her next birthday), she may strategically delay launching her plans until after the landmark. Future research exploring these possibilities would be valuable.Further, future research could explore if and how social influence reinforces the fresh start effect. For example, a spike in goal pursuit on January 1 may partly reflect a social bandwagon effect. Though other fresh start moments highlighted in the current research (e.g., the beginning of the week or month) attract less attention, the fresh start effects we observe across three studies could be magnified in part by a social contagion process whereby others‚Äô engagement in aspirational activities stimulates increases in our own goal motivation. Exploring this hypothesis in future research would be valuable.","The popularity of New Year's resolutions suggests that people are more likely to tackle their goals immediately following salient temporal landmarks. If true, this little-researched phenomenon has the potential to help people overcome important willpower problems that often limit goal attainment. Across three archival field studies, we provide evidence of a ‚Äúfresh start effect.‚Äù We show that Google searches for the term ‚Äúdiet‚Äù (Study 1), gym visits (Study 2), and commitments to pursue goals (Study 3) all increase following temporal landmarks (e.g., the outset of a new week, month, year, or semester; a birthday; a holiday). We propose that these landmarks demarcate the passage of time, creating many new mental accounting periods each year, which relegate past imperfections to a previous period, induce people to take a big-picture view of their lives, and thus motivate aspirational behaviors.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,1

Journal of Public Economics, 95(9-10), 1082-1095.","This paper evaluates the effects of the OPOWER Home Energy Reports, which give households feedback on past energy consumption, compare them to their neighbors, and provide energy conservation tips. The program is a remarkable departure from traditional energy efficiency programs in that it is a non-price intervention designed with direct insight from behavioral science that is evaluated using randomized controlled trials. The perceived success or failure of these pilot programs will directly affect millions of dollars of future investment under new energy conservation regulations and climate policies and could more generally influence how future energy efficiency programs will be designed and evaluated.

I find that the Average Treatment Effects of OPOWER's programs range from 1.4 to 3.3% of baseline usage, with an unweighted mean ATE of 2.0%. I also show that treatment effects increase markedly as a function of pre-treatment usage, although not even the lowest-consumption households increase usage in response to the treatment. Thus, while the descriptive norm information by itself might have induced these households to increase usage, some other aspect of the treatment eliminated this potential ‚Äúboomerang effect.‚Äù A regression discontinuity analysis, however, shows that being assigned to a different injunctive norm category does not significantly change the treatment effect for households near the category cutoffs. Instead, the potential descriptive norm boomerang effect must be mitigated by energy conservation tips or by aspects of the injunctive norms that affect households in the different categories by similar amounts.

This analysis adds to growing appreciation of how non-price interventions can affect consumer behavior. Economists in general, and energy sector policymakers in particular, have historically focused on how prices and subsidies affect demand. This experiment shows that simply sending letters ‚Äì a treatment that has no effect on relative prices and may have limited effects on information sets ‚Äì can persistently affect usage by as much as a 11 to 20% short run price increase or a 5% long run increase. While the welfare effects are indeterminate and merit additional thought, OPOWER's programs are relatively cost-effective from the program administrator's perspective. As climate change policies are implemented and utility regulation increasingly encourages energy conservation, such non-price treatments may receive greater attention, and insights from behavioral science may be increasingly taken to scale.","This paper evaluates a series of programs run by a company called OPOWER to send Home Energy Report letters to residential utility customers comparing their electricity use to that of their neighbors. Using data from randomized natural field experiments at 600,000 treatment and control households across the United States, I estimate that the average program reduces energy consumption by 2.0%. The program provides additional evidence that non-price interventions can substantially and cost effectively change consumer behavior: the effect is equivalent to that of a short-run electricity price increase of 11 to 20%, and the cost effectiveness compares favorably to that of traditional energy conservation programs. Perhaps because the treatment included descriptive social norms, effects are heterogeneous: households in the highest decile of pre-treatment consumption decrease usage by 6.3%, while consumption by the lowest decile decreases by only 0.3%. A regression discontinuity design shows that different categories of ‚Äúinjunctive norms‚Äù played an insignificant role in encouraging relatively low users not to increase usage.","3",0,"3","Political",3,0
217,65,"Pichert, D., & Katsikopoulos, K. V. (2008). Green defaults: Information presentation and pro-environmental behaviour. Journal of Environmental Psychology, 28(1), 63-73.","Can defaults promote pro-environmental behaviour?
We reported four studies that demonstrate a strong effect of information presentation format, specifically of the default used, on the choice of electricity utility. In electricity markets as currently organised, this effect leads to generation and consumption of energy from unsustainable sources. Changing the grey default‚Äîby establishing a green default or by just implementing a neutral choice situation‚Äîresults in a significantly higher percentage of customers buying green electricity.
Although we suggested some explanations for why defaults in electricity marketing work and provided some exploratory analyses, we did not pursue this further here. We focused on showing that they work. More theoretical research is required, for example, on understanding better the recommendations that people perceive to be implicit in defaults (McKenzie et al., 2006). Another promising direction could investigate the finding that people consider themselves far more responsible for their actions than for their omissions (Spranca, Minsk, & Baron, 1991).
At any rate, there may be opportunity for applications, especially at a local level. Imagine a community whose government plans to launch a new green electricity programme to decrease the share of conventional power production from older plants. If this was a legally and politically feasible option, the community might enrol their citizens automatically in the programme, thus establishing a default. Of course citizens would be free to opt out of the programme any time they wish. Another example might be a block of flats that is supplied with green electricity when people move in. Finally, apart from making the more environmentally benign option the default, it may be worth trying the least intrusive option of abandoning defaults altogether.
We finish by urging for caution because the manipulation of defaults has its limits. There are technical issues, limitations of default effects, and moral issues. First, it may be that, from an engineering standpoint, the implementation of a green default is not possible. For example, it has been argued that the national energy supply of a country could not simply be replaced by renewable energy production from one day to the next even if all the consumers wanted to buy green power now. In the Netherlands, for example, suppliers had to stop advertising green power because it was sold out after 13% of the customers decided to buy green electricity (Bird et al., 2002). Perhaps, however, some imagination can be used to develop creative solutions (e.g. voluntary premiums), since the central issue is changing investment flows.
Second, note that even though the influence of defaults is strong, if price differences become too large, customers might react. For example, customers will not remain with a tariff when it costs $1000 more each month regardless of whether it is the default or not. Also, when customers suspect that the vendor or the policy maker wants to force an option upon them, they might react (Brown & Krishna, 2004).
Third and finally, policy makers intentionally changing defaults may be accused of paternalistic manipulation (Berg & Gigerenzer, 2007; Klein, 2004; Sunstein & Thaler, 2003; Thaler & Sunstein, 2003). Of course, to some extent, institutions always provide starting points and defaults. And, from the environmental perspective, the existing default is not the most desirable. However, frequent opting out or switching might cause citizens to experience stress or unpleasantness. It is not so trivial to impose a default condition that conflicts with the fundamental values held by an individual as this might force a person to react. But when these ethical issues are taken into account, the manipulation of default rules actually might cause less excitement than expected.
Dealing with the ‚Äúhuman factor‚Äù in sustainable development and pro-environmental behaviour can yield theoretical and practical challenges (Gardner & Stern, 2002; Nickerson, 2003; Stern (2000a), Stern (2000b)). Our specific findings demonstrate that in many cases, what we prefer depends on the context of choice and how the choice is presented (Bettman, Luce, & Payne, 1998; Payne et al., 1992); this has already been demonstrated for human behaviour in areas such as health, finance, law, and marketing. When it comes to environmental issues, it is our conviction that a stronger consideration of insights from decision-making research will contribute to a better understanding and encouragement of pro-environmental behaviour.","There is inconsistency in many people's choice of electricity. When asked, they say they prefer a ‚Äògreen‚Äô (i.e., environmentally friendly) source for this energy. Yet, although green electricity is available in many markets, people do not generally buy it. Why not? Motivated by behavioural decision research, we argue that the format of information presentation drastically affects the choice of electricity. Specifically, we hypothesise that people use the kind of electricity that is offered to them as the default. We present two natural studies and two experiments in the laboratory that support this hypothesis. In the two real-world situations, there was a green default, and most people used it. In the first laboratory experiment, more participants chose the green utility when it was the default than when ‚Äògrey‚Äô electricity was the default. In the second laboratory experiment, participants asked for more money to give up green electricity than they were willing to pay for it. We argue that changing defaults can be used to promote pro-environmental behaviour. Potential policy-making applications of this work are discussed.","2",0,"2","Political",3,0

Experimental Economics, 24(4), 1131-1155.","Information campaigns are one of the favorite tools of governments to bring about behavioral change in the population. Compared to taxation or hard-law regulation, information campaigns have greater social acceptability, as they leave citizens with the same decision space. The success of such campaigns does, however, rely on the assumption that people are willing to become informed about topics in which the government is interested. Information resistance postulates on the contrary that some individuals might reject the information they receive when accepting it would force them to change their behaviors.
This paper addresses the consequences of information resistance for public authorities. To provide policy-makers with an ex-ante evaluation of the potential impact of information campaigns, we propose a question chart that sorts beliefs into seven categories. In Appendix A in Electronic Supplemntary Material, we show that economic theory can easily rationalize these types of beliefs, and we propose an easily-implementable experimental method that allows estimating information resistance. We also construct an Information Campaign Efectiveness Index, which corresponds to the share of incorrect beliefs that individuals are willing to revise.
We apply our method to three topics: (animal-based) diets, alcohol consumption and immigration. Our experiments show a level of information resistance of 12.4 percent for animal-based diets. Regarding the ex-ante efectiveness of information campaigns, we found a high potential for the topic of immigration. Smaller and similar potential efects are found for alcohol consumption and animal-based diets. We simulated three information campaigns to test our predictions, and we verifed a signifcantly stronger campaign efect for immigration than for animal-based diets and alcohol.
The main methodological development of this paper is to propose to policy-makers, NGOs and even private companies an efcient way to develop and assess the efectiveness of information campaigns. At very low monetary and time costs, these institutions can easily predict the efectiveness of specifc pre-defned arguments. Given the contribution to the ICEI score, they will be able to select the most arguments with the largest impact. Considering information resistance, they will also be able to detect the potential polarization in the population that a campaign may generate. For instance, policy-makers or environmental NGOs could seek to fnd the best set of arguments to convince citizens to decrease meat consumption, i.e., those that ofer the highest ICEI score and the weakest information resistance. Decomposing the data by type of argument allows to identify the furthest-reaching information campaign. As far as our sample is concerned, environmental arguments are good topics to communicate on as they have a large ICEI score with a low level of information resistance (see Table 8 below). On the contrary, health arguments will have a more limited impact as the population is more knowledgeable on the topic and is relatively more resistant to information.
Our work is a frst step in economics that seeks to quantify cognitive dissonance. However, future works could build on it to explore several directions. First, we interpret the treatment variations as the result of cognitive dissonance: when it becomes costly to lie, participants reveal the information they have or start to get informed on the topic. While we have excluded the most salient alternative explanations (demand effect, undetected online searches, cognitive efort), future works could test whether alternative forces could drive the results. Second, we consider here ‚ÄùInformation Passive Accepted Ignorance‚Äù as sincerely ignorant individuals whose opportunity costs of getting informed is too large to actively look for information on the topic. However, the opportunity cost of accessing the information could be strategically used by willful ignorant participants for not getting informed on the topic (Ehrich and Irwin 2005; Grossman and Van Der  Weele 2017). In this regard, our results are likely to capture a lower bound estimation of the Information Resistance. Future works could seek to disentangle this issue. Third, we did not consider here the role of the type of sources provided to the participants. It might be that participants might attribute a lower or greater credibility to governmental, NGO or journalistic sources. Policy makers could use our method to select the best set of sources, i.e., those that maximize the ICEI score.","We develop a method to assess population knowledge about any given topic. We define, and rationalize, types of beliefs that form the ‚Äòknowledge spectrum‚Äô. Using a sample of over 7000 UK residents, we estimate these beliefs with respect to three topics: an animal-based diet, alcohol consumption and immigration. We construct an information-campaign effectiveness index (ICEI) that predicts the success of an information campaign. Information resistance is greatest for animal-based diets, and the ICEI is highest for immigration. We test the predictive power of our ICEI by simulating information campaigns, which produces supportive evidence. Our method can be used by any government or company that wants to explore the success of an information campaign.","1",0,"1","Political",4,0

Energy Economics, 86, 104616.","Our empirical results provide a number of important insights for policy makers who consider using choice defaults as a means of achieving their policy goals. Most importantly, our findings show that using defaults to trigger more environmentally-friendly choices can effectively act as a hidden tax on the poor. Poorer households are more prone to stick to the default option, and they are also more likely to prefer cheaper and greyer products. In consequence, a green default may make them end up with greener products than they prefer, which means paying more than they want. Our study in the residential electricity market documents that such undesired effects occur. In fact, if anything our survey-based approach could understate this problem as the households who decided to respond to our survey probably tended to be more interested in the topic of electricity contracts. This makes them more likely to have made a conscious decision for their current electricity contract and thus less likely to suffer a mismatch than those who did not respond.
Having a default in the choice set is often unavoidable and may indeed be welfare-enhancing in many contexts. Especially for consumers who face high decision costs when making an active choice, relying on a default option can be beneficial (see, e.g., Chesterley, 2017, Sallee, 2014). Our results illustrate, however, that using choice defaults as an instrument for green policy making, for instance by setting the default on a particularly green and expensive option, is likely to entail negative distributional consequences. Thus, it is important that policy makers in energy markets, and other choice architects who decide about the concrete design of a choice default, are aware of these effects and keep them under close scrutiny.Our back-of-the-envelope cost-benefit analysis illustrates the challenges of using choice defaults as a policy tool for fostering green choices. The green default in our study is successful in reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions from electricity consumption. However, the cost for this emission abatement seems to be at the higher end regarding recent estimates of the social cost of carbon. Therefore, the default seems to be only a second-best instrument for curbing emissions. Taxing the marginal social damage of electricity consumption is likely to be more efficient. Taxes, however, are often politically more difficult to implement‚Äîin part because their costs and distributional consequences are quite salient‚Äîthan behavioral interventions such as green choice defaults‚Äîfor which distributional consequences are ex-ante much more unclear. Hence, a silver bullet for achieving social equity and environmental targets may not exist.Future research should address the implications of different designs of a choice default. In our study we observe the effects of one particular default and it is likely that the extent of mismatches and the individual and societal costs and benefits change with the exact design of the default (e.g., the position of the default within the choice set). Chesterley (2017) calls this the ‚Äòcomposition effect‚Äô of a choice default: Losses for consumers who are not opting out of the default and emissions avoided or caused by staying in the default may vary considerably according to which option is set as the standard. Systematically investigating these composition effects in the field is difficult. Yet, more tightly controlled experimental research in the laboratory would be valuable and add sensitivity to the results of our elicitation study. Such sensitivity analyses could generate important insights for choice architects in residential electricity markets and beyond.","Choice defaults are an increasingly popular public policy tool. Yet there is little knowledge of the distributional consequences of such nudges for different groups in society. We report results from an elicitation study in the residential electricity market in Switzerland in which we contrast consumers' actual contract choices under an existing default regime with the same consumers' active choices in a survey presenting the same choice-set without any default. We find that the default is successful at curbing greenhouse gas emissions, but it leads poorer households to pay more for their electricity consumption than they would want to, while leaving a significant willingness to pay for green electricity by richer households untapped.","4",0,"4","Political",4,0

The Journal of Higher Education, 92(7), 1164‚Äì1185. https://doi.org/10.1080/00221546.2021.1914495","The whiteness-at-work in college algebra yielded a certain entitlement by whitestudents to classroom resources. Certainly, if we‚Äôre talking about a white student and their calculator or their computer that they own, there is a clear and unyielding claim. As Leigh Patel (2015) describes, ‚ÄúWhen a people are reared to believe that the privileges they enjoy are due to their inherent superiority and/ or hard work and that the inverse is true for those who have a lower social status, this logic appears through entitlement and disdain‚Äù (p. 661). The entitlement and disdain that Patel invokes refers to the whiteness-at-work that allows, or rather encourages, white students to believe that they are right and that they are smart and that is normal. It also refers to the whiteness that allows for the racism (including ignoring and assuming BIPOC aren‚Äôt smart) that equate to disdain for Students of Color. As shown, both the white entitlement and disdain also come into play when it comes to resources.Beyond the physical forms of property and resources that constituted whiteness as property, there were other ways that whiteness worked as property. For instance, the white students‚Äô sense of belonging along with their assumed rightness or smartness also served as whiteness as property. Leonardo and Broderick (2011) describe how in the same way that we understand whiteness as property, so too does smartness operate as property, when we understand how smartness, like whiteness, is a social construction. In this portrait, we saw that belonging and smartness also operated as white property.Saito (2015) and Patel (2015) show how whiteness, as inherent in the construction of property, converges with Whiteness as Property (Harris, 1993) in higher education. Whites with an ideology of whiteness within a settler colonial structure understand (perhaps unconsciously) that they are the only ones who can truly own property, including land, possessions, smartness, intellectual property, and resources. This is whiteness-at-work (Yoon, 2012).This manifested in the algebra class, not only in the white students‚Äô treatment of their own resources as theirs, the treatment of BIPOC resources as also available for their use, but also the seizure of classroom resources for their own benefit. Whilst Quentin felt he would be over-burdening Peter to ask for a calculator for his test, each white student who did not have their own calculator had already grabbed one off the front table and was using it to practice for the test.Saito (2015) concept, where property is not acknowledged without whiteness applies to resource entitlement and allocation in a college STEM classroom. From seeing white students take charge to seeing them use any resource they wish without question, even when the resource in question was ‚Äúowned‚Äù by a BIPOC student, the rules of ownership were steadfast only when the owner was white. The rules of ownership were flexible and even disregarded when a resource was ‚Äúowned‚Äù by a Student of Color.ImplicationsThis study offers implications not only for future research on race and the college STEM classroom, but also for how we, as college educators, can facilitate the allocation of resources to promote racial equity in access and use of those resources. It shows the stark relationship between whiteness and property in terms of norms and whiteness-at-work in a STEM classroom and invites us to not only see it but reimagine andragogical responses and resistance to such racism.We are a long way off from white students in algebra dismantling or even checking their own white entitlement to ensure equitable distribution of resources in the classroom. Thus, we need to have sufficient resources, particularly in the white institutional space of the STEM classroom so that all students are able to use the resources required to succeed in learning. When I tallied the costs of the resources needed to fully participate in college algebra, it came to approximately 300 USD (on the low end), and these are out of pocket costs. 300 USD to fully participate. 300 USD to not feel shamed asking for help. 300 USD to keep your STEM dream alive.I recommend that these resources be literally placed in the hands of all students. We mustn‚Äôt put the onus on Students of Color to ask for the resources they need, because they don‚Äôt possess the entitlement of their white classmates. Many BIPOC students bring trauma from racist white teachers and classmates in K-12, such that they are reticent to ask for help as we saw with Quentin and Mariah.We need financial aid policies and funding that allow for all students, but particularly BIPOC students from low socioeconomic backgrounds to access the resources they need to succeed in the classroom. We know that out-of-pocket costs disproportionately affect BIPOC students, creating a barrier for them (DiazStrong et al., 2011). Reform is necessary to ensure that all students have things like calculators, MyMathLab access, lab equipment, laptops or tablets, textbooks, etc.Beyond this, it is imperative that we begin teaching concepts of race, racism, and whiteness to all college students. When BIPOC students have the vocabulary to describe what they are experiencing, they are further empowered to resist racism in the classroom. Simultaneously, when white students‚Äô whiteness norms are disrupted, they too can begin dismantling their own and others‚Äô racism within the classroom. I call for required courses on race and racism for college freshmen, not to mention for faculty in their faculty development requirements. These courses must go well beyond the current ‚Äúimplicit bias‚Äù and ‚Äúrespect diversity‚Äù style education that reek of race-evasion (Annamma et al., 2017). Instead, these courses must be grounded in a critical demonstration of race as a social construction and a critical interrogation of racism and whiteness. Additionally, this education should focus on how white supremacism works with other systems like heteropatriarchy, ability, and classism.Yet, to place the onus for the whiteness-at-work in higher education on student education is inappropriate. It is STEM faculty who need to understand and engage in deep critical race education and andragogy so that they might recognize how whiteness and racism are working in their classrooms. Additionally, we need processes in place where scholars with critical race understanding review courses and work with faculty to incorporate course facilitation plans that can assess how whiteness is working in their classrooms and remedy this.This work offers a glimpse into white hoarding in college algebra, but more research is needed, not only to validate critical race perspectives in college STEM, but also to reveal ways that we can resist and combat such hoarding. Being able to see and identify white entitlement and white hoarding is only the first step.College algebra is a gatekeeper course for students seeking a degree in a STEM field and is a major barrier for many BIPOC students. For the Students of Color who do test out of or pass college algebra and move along, other gatekeeper courses or ‚Äúweeder‚Äù courses await them, such as Organic Chemistry or Calculus. Research has shown that the further Students of Color progress in STEM education, the more whiteness and racism they tend to face in their classes (Harper, 2010; McGee, 2020; McGee & Martin, 2011). I call for more research to look at whiteness in the STEM college classroom, and particularly STEM gatekeeper courses and labs, and for continued investigation of white hoarding and related phenomena in these environments.In closing, when we see how whiteness is working through a lens of CRT, Settler Colonialism, and CWS, we see that the old adage, sharing is caring, is not the reality. In most instances, it is white hoarding.","This study uses Critical Race Theory, Settler Colonialism, and Critical Whiteness Studies to frame how property is recognized only under the auspices of whiteness. In the college algebra classroom, this is born out through white entitlement, racialized senses of sharing, and resource allocation. This study uses portraiture to depict how white hoarding, as the co-option of resources by white students, marginalizes and disenfranchises Students of Color.","1",0,"1","Political",1,1

Educational Psychology Review, 35(1), 8. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10648-023-09728-2","Martin et al. (2022) put forth a call for research that advocates for counter theories or critical theories, uses asset-based theories, and decries defcit-based theoretical stances (J. P. Martin et al., 2022). In this work, we have presented evidence that contradicts the defcitbased theoretical stance that women possess poor spatial skills which hinder their participation in STEM. We present a counter-theory: that the construct of spatial ability has been co-constructed with gender. Spatial ability has not been framed in a gender-neutral manner. Instead, the tasks considered to require spatial ability and the instruments used to measure spatial ability, both of which essentially comprise our understanding of what ‚Äúspatial ability‚Äù is, have been conceived of in a gender-linked way. Spatial ability has been emphasized in masculinized disciplines, while the role that spatial ability plays in feminized disciplines like garment construction, sewing, ceramics, interior design, domestic jobs, nursing, sonography, etc. has been largely ignored. Rather than solely serving a useful educational purpose, our fndings suggest that spatial testing has also served to ‚Äúengineer the engineer,‚Äù justify the homogeneity of many STEM programs and professions, and distract attention away from other factors that cause certain groups to be minoritized in engineering and STEM.In spite of a widely held belief that sex-related biological traits lead to gender diferences in performance on spatial ability test, we did not fnd evidence in the literature that this is true. Evolutionary explanations also fall short due to their failure to consider the geometric projection drawing style used on the instruments and its lack of connection to the way objects naturally appear in nature. This lack of ‚Äúnatural‚Äù diferences makes sense in light of the fact that spatial assessment instruments and scoring systems were tailored to favor males, and spatial ability itself was then defned by these instruments and methods.Though hundreds of spatial assessments have been created during the past century, researchers considered the tests that maximized the performance of men to have the most ‚Äúspatial‚Äù content. When evidence showed that gender diferences were not the result of the spatial content of the instrument, this was ignored. Instead, one of the most widely used spatial tests, the MRT, rose to a position of prominence not because of its great ability to assess mental rotation, but because in part because researchers wanted to demonstrate large gender diferences. Instruments that have been selectively bred to produce gender diferences in performance, as appears to be the case with the MRT, cannot also be used to measure gender diferences. In any case, multiple researchers have shown that gender diferences in performance on the MRT are not actually related to mental rotation ability (Bors & Vigneau, 2011; Caissie et al., 2009; Toth & Campbell, 2019). This is further supported by the fact that many studies which recreated the MRT with 3D stimuli instead of 2D drawings did not fnd gender differences (Fisher et al., 2018; Larson et al., 1999; McWilliams et al., 1997; Neubauer et al., 2010). We hope that spatial researchers can use the fndings of this paper to revise and improve their research methods. We provide recommendations for researchers in the following section.Recommendations for Future ResearchersWe conclude with recommendations for future researchers interested in studying spatial ability.General Recommendations for Spatial ResearchWe do not recommend researchers continue to use the MRT to measure the construct of mental rotation, since factors other than mental rotation affect performance on the instrument. We also do not recommend citing studies or meta-analyses that rely on the MRT to support the idea that men have better mental rotation skills than women. We are not the frst to point this out, but the rotation of rigid objects represents just one small slice of the many diferent types of abilities that could be considered ‚Äúspatial abilities.‚Äù We recommend against framing spatial ability as more important in masculinized disciplines than in feminized disciplines, and taking a more holistic view about what roles in society require one to think in three dimensions, including roles that are not traditionally considered to be part of STEM. Spatial researchers should explore the spatial construct more broadly, keeping in mind these other roles.Validating Spatial Assessment InstrumentsWe recommend a much more stringent approach to validating psychometric instruments that are intended to measure spatial ability. It goes without saying that gender diferences are not appropriate evidence of instrument validity. One acceptable method of assessing the construct validity of a spatial instrument would be to compare performance on an item with the degree of mental manipulation required to solve the item. Shepard and Metzler used this method in their original experiments when they demonstrated a linear relationship between the time taken to solve an item and the degree of rotation needed‚Äîitems with a higher degree of rotation took longer to solve (Shepard & Metzler, 1971). Similar approaches have also been used by some spatial researchers to validate stimulus sets (for example: Atit et al., 2013; Ganis & Kievit, 2015). Researchers should also pay close attention to the role that domain-specifc background knowledge plays in the spatial assessment (Atit et al., 2020; Stief et al., 2018). This is true even in psychometric tests thought to assess ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù spatial skills, as familiarity with the conventions of engineering graphics likely plays a role in performance many such assessments (Bartlett & Camba, 2021), so performance on such tests cannot be considered to be purely a result of ‚Äúspatial‚Äù thinking.In spite of the convenience factor provided by paper-based tests, researchers should carefully consider how delivering spatial content in this medium necessarily removes the ‚Äúspace‚Äù from the assessments and introduces other factors. This is particularly true of tests that require a 3D interpretation of a 2D drawing. One method to investigate whether graphics interpretation is introducing construct-irrelevant variance into the instrument would be to compare performance on physical and paper-based measures. Paper-based tests that do require interpretation of complex drawings should at minimum be validated in small pilot studies against more ‚Äúrealworld‚Äù stimuli to see if the paper-based test produces the same results.Researching ‚ÄúSex Diferences‚Äù or ‚ÄúGender Diferences‚ÄùThe fact that inquiry into gender diferences in spatial ability has a long history is not adequate justifcation for researchers to uncritically continue down the same path. Researchers should be very clear about what they mean by the terms ‚Äúsex‚Äù or ‚Äúgender‚Äù in their research and should justify why they are using those constructs. The search for ‚Äúsex diferences‚Äù or ‚Äúgender diferences‚Äù in cognitive abilities has many inherent weaknesses, including the fact that sex and gender are not treatment variables. Gender research can only ever be correlational, yet gender research in spatial ability tends to use gender inappropriately as a ‚Äúcausal variable‚Äù or ‚Äútreatment variable‚Äù (Caplan et al., 1997; Holland, 2008; Lips & Colwill, 1978; Major & Godwin, 2019). Treatment variables or causal variables are appropriately used when participants can be randomly assigned into diferent groups: a treatment group and a control group. People cannot be randomly assigned into diferent gender groups, so fndings about gender are correlational in nature, not causational. Rather than causing diferences, gender serves as a marker for diferent patterns of socialization. Parents generally treat children diferently according to gender, increasing the likelihood that they will have diferent developmental trajectories (Brown & Tam, 2019). The root cause here is not gender, but diferential treatment and socialization.Instead of gender, it makes sense for spatial researchers to group people based on other criteria such as past background experience, since this is a factor that is likely to directly contribute to diferences in spatial ability. For example, researchers may decide to group novices versus experts, people who have not taken a geometry class versus people who have, etc. This research method can more precisely help us understand what experiences might contribute to certain spatial skills.","Spatial ability has long been regarded as important in STEM, and mental rotation, a subcategory of spatial ability, is widely accepted as the cognitive ability with the largest gender difference in favor of men. Multiple meta-analyses of various tests of spatial ability have found large gender differences in outcomes of the mental rotation test (MRT). In this paper, we argue that more recent literature suggests that the MRT is not a valid measure of mental rotation ability. More importantly, we argue that the construct of ‚Äúspatial ability‚Äù itself has been co-constructed with gender, and thus has not been devised in a neutral way, but in a manner that is influenced by gender beliefs. We discuss that though spatial thinking is also required in feminized fields, past research has cast spatial ability as only necessary in masculinized STEM fields. Due to a prevailing belief that spatial ability was an inherently male ability, researchers ‚Äúselectively bred‚Äù some spatial assessment instruments to maximize gender differences, rather than to precisely measure a spatial construct. We argue that such instruments, of which the MRT is one, cannot validly assess between-group differences, and ideas about biological or evolutionary causes of sex differences in spatial ability lack empirical evidence. Instead, the co-construction of gender and spatial ability better explains observed patterns. We also provide recommendations for spatial researchers moving forward.","2",0,"2","Political",2,1
222,66,"Harrison, T., Shipstead, Z., & Engle, R. (2015). Why is Working Memory Capacity Related to Matrix Reasoning Tasks? Memory & Cognition, 43(3), 389‚Äì396.","Not only are the results of our study inconsistent with the interference/distraction account, they contradict it. One of the reasons that WMC is correlated with Raven‚Äôs problems is that WMC allows individuals to maintain in memory how they solved previous problems (i.e., the learning efficiency account). This is particularly helpful when the next problem that an individual has to solve requires the same rule combination as the previous problem. Even though WMC and Gf are highly related constructs, this study shows a dissociation between the two. Only the WMC relationship to Raven‚Äôs problems is higher for the repeated-rule-combinations problems. The relationship to other Gf tasks stays the same, regardless of whether the Raven‚Äôs problem requires a novel or a repeated rule combination. The particular advantage of our study is that we used a combination of an experimental and a differential approach to research (e.g., Chuderski, 2013; Shipstead & Engle, 2013). Although this type of design requires more subjects in order to counterbalance the order of presentation, it allows for a critical test of the interference/distraction account. We were therefore able to eliminate potential confounds and test whether novelrule or repeated-rule problems relate more strongly to WMC. We think that this approach will be a very useful one for future individual-differences research. Researchers can use it to essentially treat correlations as a dependent variable and manipulate factors to determine whether those factors change the correlation. The higher correlations between repeated-rule Raven‚Äôs problems and WMC in our study are interesting for several reasons. Although attention control plays a large role in the correlation between WMC and Gf (Engle & Kane, 2004), there are many potential reasons for the correlation between WMC and Gf. Researchers have shown that secondary memory is as strongly correlated with Gf as is attentional control (Shipstead et al., 2014; Unsworth & Spillers, 2010). Likewise, one of the reasons that WMC is correlated with Raven‚Äôs problems is possibly that subjects with high WMC are able to retrieve solutions from previous Raven‚Äôs problems to solve the current problem. Some researchers have argued that subjects‚Äô ability to retrieve information from short-term memory can completely account for WMC‚Äôs relationship to Gf (Colom et al., 2006; Mart√≠nez et al., 2011). Although our results support the learning efficiency hypothesis, we believe that the correlation between Raven‚Äôs problems and WMC cannot be accounted for by just one mechanism (e.g., dealing with inference or short-term memory). Just as multiple cognitive abilities (i.e., primary memory, secondary memory, and attention control) can account for complex span tasks‚Äô intercorrelations, there are multiple reasons why performance on Raven‚Äôs could be correlated with WMC.Additionally, the dissociation between WMC and Gf is particularly interesting. Recently, we have theorized that the critical distinction between WMC and Gf is that WMC reflects the ability to maintain easy accessibility of relevant information in memory, and that Gf is related to the ability to disengage from irrelevant information in memory (Shipstead, Harrison, & Engle, 2014). Our findings in the present study support this theory. Only the relationship to WMC is increased for the repeated-rule problems, the ones that would be easier to solve if subjects had the solution of the previous problem still activated in memory.","One of the reasons why working memory capacity is so widely researched is its substantial relationship with fluid intelligence. Although this relationship has been found in numerous studies, researchers have been unable to provide a conclusive answer as to why the two constructs are related. In a recent study, researchers examined which attributes of Raven‚Äôs Progressive Matrices were most strongly linked with working memory capacity (Wiley, Jarosz, Cushen, & Colflesh, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 37, 256‚Äì263, 2011). In that study, Raven‚Äôs problems that required a novel combination of rules to solve were more strongly correlated with working memory capacity than were problems that did not. In the present study, we wanted to conceptually replicate the Wiley et al. results while controlling for a few potential confounds. Thus, we experimentally manipulated whether a problem required a novel combination of rules and found that repeated-rulecombination problems were more strongly related to working memory capacity than were novel-rule-combination problems. The relationship to other measures of fluid intelligence did not change based on whether the problem required a novel rule combination.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,1
223,66,"Wai, J., Lubinski, D., & Benbow, C. (2009). Spatial ability for STEM domains: Aligning over 50 years of cumulative psychological knowledge solidifies its importance. Journal of Educational Psychology, 101(4), 817‚Äì835. https://doi.org/10.1037/a0016127","DiscussionLongitudinal findings uncovered in this study combined with results of earlier investigations (Super & Bachrach, 1957) and recent longitudinal findings on intellectually precocious youths (Shea et al., 2001; Webb et al., 2007) suggest at least three generalizations: First, spatial ability is a salient psychological characteristic among adolescents who subsequently go on to achieve advanced educational and occupational credentials in STEM. Second, spatial ability plays a critical role in structuring educational and occupational outcomes in the general population as well as among intellectually talented individuals. Third, contemporary talent searches miss many intellectually talented students by restricting selection criteria to mathematical and verbal ability measures.Given the body of evidence now available and the fresh empirical findings presented here on thousands of high school students tracked 11 years following their high school graduation, sufficient support has accrued to demonstrate that the importance of spatial ability in STEM domains has been operating for several decades. Just as F. L. Schmidt and Hunter (1998) concluded in their 85-year review of the role that general intelligence plays in the world of work (‚Äúmore research is not needed‚Äù), we conclude that enough empirical evidence has accrued to register another rare example of a solid empirical generalization within the human psychological sciences. This does not mean, however, that other research is not needed. The kind of research that is needed now is in how to utilize spatial ability for student selection, instruction, and curriculum design and in how to refine educational interventions and procedures on the basis of individual differences in spatial ability (Corno et al., 2002; Lubinski, 2004, pp. 105‚Äì106).In addition, measures of spatial ability should be incorporated into models of educational and occupational development to ascertain the role spatial ability plays relative to other abilities and relevant nonintellectual determinants (Lubinski & Benbow, 2000, 2006). Given the evidence presented here, psychological modeling of STEM outcomes must incorporate spatial ability to avoid being incomplete or underdetermined (Lubinski, 2000; Lubinski & Humphreys, 1997). This is particularly true among those who go on to develop especially high levels of STEM expertise (cf. Figures 2, 5, 7, and Appendix B).Furthermore, expanding admissions criteria for talent searches currently focused on identifying intellectually talented youths solely on the basis of scores on mathematical and verbal measures should be considered, as Snow (1999) suggested. For example, in Project TALENT, over half of participants in the top 1% on the Spatial Composite were below the top 3% cut on both the Mathematical and Verbal Composites, and, thus, they would not be invited to participate in modern talent searches. Moreover, there is reason to believe that the educational needs of spatially talented youths are more unmet than those of mathematically or verbally talented youths, because the typical middle and high school curriculum has many more opportunities for developing mathematical and verbal ability than spatial ability (Colangelo et al., 2004; Lohman, 2005).Ackerman (1996; Ackerman & Heggestad, 1997) has shown that all three of the specific abilities examined here (mathematical, spatial, and verbal) have distinctive external correlational profiles with respect to conventional measures of interests, personality, and values. For example, verbal ability tends to covary positively with interests in the humanities and helping people and to covary negatively with interests in engineering and technical pursuits. The opposite is true for spatial ability. An examination of the intercorrelations of Project TALENT‚Äôs ability and interest measures reveals that these trait clusters, too, have been observed for decades in normative samples (Shaycoft, 1967) and, thus, must be seen as relatively stable. Moreover, these patterns of covariation have been replicated with intellectually talented youths (D. B. Schmidt, Lubinski, & Benbow, 1998) and have emerged as salient weights in discriminant function analyses in the prediction of STEM criteria (Achter, Lubinski, Benbow, & Eftekhari-Sanjani, 1999; Wai, Lubinski, & Benbow, 2005; Webb et al., 2007). Therefore, the motivational proclivities for students selected on the basis of mathematical versus spatial versus verbal ability should be expected to differ. That is, intellectually talented students selected by extreme cutting scores on measures of mathematical versus spatial versus verbal ability should be expected to have different interest patterns as well as differential preferences for linguistic, quantitative, and nonverbal ideation or contrasting modes of learning and thought (Corno et al., 2002).Just as mathematically and verbally talented students have profited for decades by talent searches that identify students especially able at verbal and mathematical reasoning and the provision of tailored, developmentally appropriate curriculum aligned to their precocious rates of learning (or reasoning with linguistic and numerical symbols, respectively), students talented in spatial ability are likely to profit from identification procedures utilizing measures of spatial ability followed by opportunities for developmentally appropriate curriculum involving their preferred mode of thought (reasoning with forms or shapes). Experimentation with accelerative and rigorous learning opportunities in architecture, engineering, robotics, and the physical sciences appear to be particularly warranted in order to nurture their form of talent.Finally, sex differences in relative levels of interests are important to take into consideration. Although the covariance structure of specific abilities and interests is comparable for males and for females, the sexes display mean differences in a number of interests; for instance, spatially talented females tend to be more interested in artistic pursuits than are spatially talented males and the inverse is true for engineering and mechanical activities (Lubinski & Benbow, 2006; D. B. Schmidt et al., 1998). These mean sex differences in interests correspond to findings, shown in Figure 8, that spatially talented females were more likely than similarly talented males to pursue artistic domains. These proclivities can and do change over time, but relative levels of interests (and competing interests) are always important to take into account (Geary, 1998, 2005; Gottfredson, 2003, 2005).Cumulative Psychological Knowledge Collectively, the findings reported here, when combined with Super and Bachrach‚Äôs (1957) NSF report and linked to modern research on talent search participants (Shea et al., 2001; Webb et al., 2007), tell a cohesive story about the longitudinal stability of spatial ability and its psychological import (see Figures 2, 5, 7, and Appendix B). For decades, spatial ability has emerged as a salient psychological characteristic among young adolescents who go on to develop expertise in STEM domains (see Figure 7).This fact is important for more general considerations, because in psychology the lack of cumulative knowledge upon which to build theory and practice is often bemoaned. Cronbach (1975) has discussed the short ‚Äúhalf-life‚Äù of empirical generalizations in the social sciences (i.e., how quickly they decay) and wrote, ‚ÄúThe trouble, as I see it, is that we cannot store up generalizations and constructs for ultimate assembly into a network‚Äù (p. 123). Similarly, Meehl (1978) has observed that the ‚Äúsoft areas of psychology lack the cumulative character of scientific knowledge‚Äù (p. 806). Leaders in industrial (Dunnette, 1966) and clinical psychology (Dawes, 1994) have echoed these remarks. The current study offers an example of how the human psychological sciences can generate cumulative knowledge. Teaming constructive replication with longitudinal inquiry appears to be a compelling way to achieve cumulative psychological knowledge by revealing consistent function forms both across and within cohorts over protracted intervals.ConclusionAs I. M. Smith (1964) stated so well 45 years ago, The qualities which make for greatness in scientists and engineers are of a different kind; ability to think abstractly and analytically together with skill in visualizing spatial relations in two or three dimensions, . . . All these qualities, which are vitally important in almost all branches of science and engineering, are measured by appropriate tests of spatial ability. (p. 300)Spatial ability‚Äôs robust influence on STEM domains has been supported in this article through the presentation of findings that link decades of longitudinal research. Collectively, the studies presented here constitute a series of constructive replications revealing similarities in function form and pattern across time (Meehl, 1978, 1990; Steen, 1988); therefore, an empirical generalization may be ventured on the importance of spatial ability in scientific and technical domains. In addition, individuals who are high in spatial ability but not as exceptional in mathematical or verbal abilities constitute an untapped pool of talent for STEM domains. Currently, more research is needed on how to effectively structure educational opportunities to serve students talented in spatial ability. Such efforts, if successful, will contribute to the urgent social need of effectively identifying and developing scientific and technical talent for the information age.","The importance of spatial ability in educational pursuits and the world of work was examined, with particular attention devoted to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) domains. Participants were drawn from a stratified random sample of U.S. high schools (Grades 9‚Äì12, N = 400,000) and were tracked for 11+ years; their longitudinal findings were aligned with pre-1957 findings and with contemporary data from the Graduate Record Examination and the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth. For decades, spatial ability assessed during adolescence has surfaced as a salient psychological attribute among those adolescents who subsequently go on to achieve advanced educational credentials and occupations in STEM. Results solidify the generalization that spatial ability plays a critical role in developing expertise in STEM and suggest, among other things, that including spatial ability in modern talent searches would identify many adolescents with potential for STEM who are currently being missed.

Why minimal guidance during instruction does not work: An analysis of the failure of constructivist, discovery, problem-based, experiential, and inquiry-based teaching. Educational Psychologist, 41(2), 75‚Äì86.","After a half-century of advocacy associated with instruction using minimal guidance, it appears that there is no body of research supporting the technique. In so far as there is any evidence from controlled studies, it almost uniformly supports direct, strong instructional guidance rather than constructivist-based minimal guidance during the instruction of novice to intermediate learners. Even for students MINIMAL GUIDANCE 83 with considerable prior knowledge, strong guidance while learning is most often found to be equally effective as unguided approaches. Not only is unguided instruction normally less effective; there is also evidence that it may have negative results when students acquire misconceptions or incomplete or disorganized knowledge. Although the reasons for the ongoing popularity of a failed approach are unclear, the origins of the support for instruction with minimal guidance in science education and medical education might be found in the post-Sputnik science curriculum reforms such as Biological Sciences Curriculum Study, Chemical Education Material Study, and Physical Science Study Committee. At that time, educators shifted away from teaching a discipline as a body of knowledge toward the assumption that knowledge can best or only be learned through experience that is based only on the procedures of the discipline. This point of view appears to have led to unguided practical or project work and the rejection of instruction based on the facts, laws, principles, and theories that make up a discipline‚Äôs content. The emphasis on the practical application of what is being learned seems very positive. However, it may be an error to assume that the pedagogic content of the learning experience is identical to the methods and processes (i.e., the epistemology) of the discipline being studied and a mistake to assume that instruction should exclusively focus on application. It is regrettable that current constructivist views have become ideological and often epistemologically opposed to the presentation and explanation of knowledge. As a result, it is easy to share the puzzlement of Handelsman et al. (2004), who, when discussing science education, asked: ‚ÄúWhy do outstanding scientists who demand rigorous proof for scientific assertions in their research continue to use and, indeed defend on the bias of intuition alone, teaching methods that are not the most effective?‚Äù (p. 521). It is also easy to agree with Mayer‚Äôs (2004) recommendation that we ‚Äúmove educational reform efforts from the fuzzy and unproductive world of ideology‚Äîwhich sometimes hides under the various banners of constructivism‚Äîto the sharp and productive world of theory-based research on how people learn‚Äù (p. 18)","Evidence for the superiority of guided instruction is explained in the context of our knowledge of human cognitive architecture, expert‚Äìnovice differences, and cognitive load. Although unguided or minimally guided instructional approaches are very popular and intuitively appealing, the point is made that these approaches ignore both the structures that constitute human cognitive architecture and evidence from empirical studies over the past half-century that consistently indicate that minimally guided instruction is less effective and less efficient than instructional approaches that place a strong emphasis on guidance of the student learning process. The advantage of guidance begins to recede only when learners have sufficiently high prior knowledge to provide ‚Äúinternal‚Äù guidance. Recent developments in instructional research and instructional design models that support guidance during instruction are briefly described.","5",0,"5","Political",6,1
225,68,"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-39558-8","Our results show that the transition to a simple multicellular life cycle can happen rapidly in response to an ecologically relevant selective pressure. By increasing in size beyond the ‚Äúpredation threshold‚Äù13 of a filter-feeding predator, multicellular C. reinhardtii that evolved from an ancestrally unicellular lineage are protected from predation for at least part of their life cycle. Under selection for increased size, formation of multicellular structures may be an easier route than increasing cell size because of trade-offs imposed by scaling relationships (chiefly the reduction in surface-area-to-volume ratio)18, because more mutational paths are available, and/or because available mutations have fewer or less severe pleiotropic effects.

Observations in other species suggest that the relative ease of transitioning from a unicellular to a multicellular life cycle is at least somewhat general. Similar transitions reportedly occurred within 100 generations in the green alga Chlorella vulgaris6 and within 300 generations in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae8. Although there have surely been many microbial evolution experiments in which multicellularity did not evolve, we can at least be confident that this phenomenon is not unique to Chlamydomonas. Grosberg and Strathmann4 may have been right to call the evolution of multicellularity a ‚Äúminor major transition‚Äù.

However, the available evidence also suggests a substantial stochastic component to the evolution of multicellularity. In previous experiments using settling selection as opposed to predation selection, multicellular structures evolved in one of ten selected populations in C. reinhardtii9 and in ‚Äúabout 70%‚Äù of ‚Äúmany‚Äù selected populations in C. vulgaris6. In the experiment reported here, a variety of multicellular forms evolved in two of five selected populations. Only in S. cerevisiae has the evolution of such forms proven consistent across replicate populations8.

The multicellular forms that evolved in our experiments bear some resemblance to palmelloids, transient multicellular structures that appear under some conditions in C. reinhardtii and related algae. The propensity to form palmelloids varies among species and strains19,20. In wild-type C. reinhardtii, it is a phenotypically plastic response to the presence of certain organic acids21, Ca2+ deficiency, chelating agents, high phosphate concentrations22, and certain zooplankton predators23,24. Predators have also been observed to induce the formation of multicellular structures in the green algae Chlorella25,26 and Scenedesmus27,28, as well as in bacteria29,30.

The term ‚Äúpalmelloid‚Äù encompasses two distinct phenomena: a failure of daughter cells to escape the mother cell wall, resulting in ‚Äòcolonies‚Äô of four to sixteen cells, and the production of a gelatinous material that is secreted extracellularly, resulting in adhesion among cells and/or colonies20. Cell walls are easily distinguished from ECM under magnification, since cell walls block transmitted light much more strongly (i.e. appear much darker) than ECM. We observe both phenomena in evolved multicellular isolates.

The ability of wild-type C. reinhardtii to form palmelloids suggests that the founding population in our experiment already possessed a toolkit for producing multicellular structures. However, while the palmelloid condition is expressed facultatively in wild-type C. reinhardtii, the strains that evolved in our experiment are obligately multicellular. Like palmelloids, our evolved multicellular isolates lack motility, suggesting that the ability to express both unicellular and multicellular phenotypes may be optimal when predation pressure varies over time31.

Our life cycle observations, carried out in as near as possible identical conditions, constitute a common-garden experiment, demonstrating that the evolved phenotypes have a genetic basis. It may be, though, that this basis involves the co-option of a previously existing plastic response. If so, the shift from a primarily unicellular (but facultatively multicellular) to an obligately multicellular life cycle may have required only a change from facultative to obligate expression of the genes involved in palmelloid formation.

Our results support the view that predation may have played a role in at least some origins of multicellularity. Consistent with prior results6,7, predation can drive the evolution of simple multicellular structures, and these structures provide protection from predators6,32. The ‚Äòchicken-and-egg‚Äô problem brought up by some authors ‚Äì that multicellular predators are required to drive the evolution of multicellularity2,12 ‚Äì does not exist: unicellular filter-feeding protists exist, including, for example, Paramecium, and there is no reason to think that such predators only arose after animals. Furthermore, some origins of multicellularity, including those of brown and volvocine algae, postdate that of animals, and could therefore have been driven by animal predation.","The transition from unicellular to multicellular life was one of a few major events in the history of life that created new opportunities for more complex biological systems to evolve. Predation is hypothesized as one selective pressure that may have driven the evolution of multicellularity. Here we show that de novo origins of simple multicellularity can evolve in response to predation. We subjected outcrossed populations of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to selection by the filter-feeding predator Paramecium tetraurelia. Two of five experimental populations evolved multicellular structures not observed in unselected control populations within ~750 asexual generations. Considerable variation exists in the evolved multicellular life cycles, with both cell number and propagule size varying among isolates. Survival assays show that evolved multicellular traits provide effective protection against predation. These results support the hypothesis that selection imposed by predators may have played a role in some origins of multicellularity.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",4,0
226,68,"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-020-0858-1","Analysing nearly 100‚Äâmillion traffic stops across the country, we have worked to quantify the often complex relationship between race and policing in the United States. Our analysis provides evidence that decisions about whom to stop and, subsequently, whom to search are biased against black and Hispanic drivers. Our results, however, also point to the power of policy interventions‚Äîspecifically, legalization of recreational marijuana‚Äîto reduce these racial disparities.These findings lend insight into patterns of policing, but they only partially capture the wider impacts of law enforcement on communities of colour. If, for example, officers disproportionately patrol black and Hispanic neighbourhoods, the downstream effects can be injurious even if individual stop decisions are not directly affected by the colour of one‚Äôs skin. Similarly, enforcement of minor traffic violations, like broken tail lights‚Äîeven if conducted uniformly and without animus‚Äîcan place heavy burdens on black and Hispanic drivers without improving public safety17. We hope the data we have collected and released are useful for measuring, and in turn addressing, these broader effects.In the course of carrying out this study, we encountered many challenges working with large-scale policing data. We conclude by offering several recommendations for future data collection, release and analysis. As a minimum, we encourage jurisdictions to collect individual-level stop data that include the date and time of the stop; the location of the stop; the race, gender and age of the driver; the stop reason; whether a search was conducted; the search type (for example, ‚Äòprobable cause‚Äô or ‚Äòconsent‚Äô); whether contraband was found during a search; the stop outcome (for example, a citation or an arrest); and the specific violation with which the driver was charged. Most jurisdictions collect only a subset of this information. There are also variables that are currently rarely collected but would be useful for analysis, such as indicia of criminal behaviour, an officer‚Äôs rationale for conducting a search and short narratives written by officers describing the incident. New York City‚Äôs UF-250 form for pedestrian stops is an example of how such information can be efficiently collected31,32.Equally important to data collection is ensuring the integrity of the recorded information. We frequently encountered missing values and errors in the data (for example, implausible values for a driver‚Äôs age and invalid racial categorizations). Automated procedures can be put in place to help detect and correct such problems. For example, the recorded race of the driver is often based on the officer‚Äôs perception rather than a driver‚Äôs self-categorization. While there are perhaps sound reasons for this practice, it increases the likelihood of errors. To quantify and correct for this issue, police departments might regularly audit their data, possibly by comparing an officer‚Äôs perception of race to a third party‚Äôs judgement based on driver‚Äôs licence photos for a random sample of stopped drivers.Despite the existence of public records laws, several jurisdictions failed to respond to our repeated requests for information. We hope that law enforcement agencies consider taking steps to make data more accessible to both external researchers and the public. Connecticut and North Carolina are at the forefront of opening up their data, providing online portals for anyone to download and analyse this information.We also hope that police departments start to analyse their data regularly and report the results of their findings. Such analyses might include estimates of stop, search and hit rates stratified by race, age, gender and location; distribution of stop reasons by race; and trends over time. More ambitiously, departments could use their data to design statistically informed guidelines that encourage more consistent, efficient and equitable decisions31,33,34,35. Many of these analyses can be automated and rerun regularly with little marginal effort. In conjunction with releasing the data underlying these analyses, we recommend that the analysis code also be released to ensure reproducibility.Finally, it bears emphasis that the type of large-scale data analysis we have carried out in this paper is but one of many complementary ways to gauge and rectify bias in police interactions with the public. Just as critical, for example, are conversations with both officers and community members, who can often provide more nuance than is possible with our aggregate statistical approach. Collecting, releasing and analysing police data are important steps for increasing the effectiveness and equity of law enforcement practices, and for improving relations with the public through transparency. Ultimately, though, data collection and analysis are not enough. We must act on the results of such efforts if we are to reduce the persistent, discriminatory impacts of policing on communities of colour.","We assessed racial disparities in policing in the United States by compiling and analysing a dataset detailing nearly 100‚Äâmillion traffic stops conducted across the country. We found that black drivers were less likely to be stopped after sunset, when a ‚Äòveil of darkness‚Äô masks one‚Äôs race, suggesting bias in stop decisions. Furthermore, by examining the rate at which stopped drivers were searched and the likelihood that searches turned up contraband, we found evidence that the bar for searching black and Hispanic drivers was lower than that for searching white drivers. Finally, we found that legalization of recreational marijuana reduced the number of searches of white, black and Hispanic drivers‚Äîbut the bar for searching black and Hispanic drivers was still lower than that for white drivers post-legalization. Our results indicate that police stops and search decisions suffer from persistent racial bias and point to the value of policy interventions to mitigate these disparities.","2",0,"2","Political",2,0

Unlike earlier studies, we are able to completely explain the pay gap with three main factors related to driver preferences/constraints and learning: returns to experience, a pay premium for faster driving, and differences in driving locations. Indeed, the contribution of the returns to experience to gender earnings gaps has received little attention in the empirical literature, as it is often quite difficult to measure in traditional work settings. We find that even tracking the number of weeks worked‚Äîa common proxy for experience in the literature‚Äîdoes not accurately quantify experience, as men work more hours per week than women and thus accumulate experience more quickly. Measuring the returns to experience is especially important when quantifying the job-flexibility penalty, as omitting experience from the regression overstates the job-flexibility penalty.

Importantly, we do not find women to be disadvantaged by three factors that one might expect to contribute to a gender wage gap: returns to work intensity, preferences or constraints affecting specific hours worked, or customer discrimination. Overall, our results suggest that on-the-job learning may contribute to the gender earnings gap more broadly in the economy than previously thought. In this spirit, policies that target changes in the time-use choices of men and women may narrow the gender pay gap by helping women move up the learning curve at the same pace as men.

We have shown that, even in the gender-blind, transactional, flexible environment of the gig economy, gender-based preferences/constraints (especially the value of time not spent at paid work and, for drivers, preferences for driving speed) can open gender earnings gaps. Preference/constraint differences that contribute to pay differences in professional markets for lawyers and MBA‚Äôs also lead to earnings gaps for Uber drivers, suggesting that they are pervasive across the skill distribution, whether in the traditional or gig workplace.","The growth of the ‚Äúgig‚Äù economy generates worker flexibility that, some have speculated, will favour women. We explore this by examining labour supply choices and earnings among more than a million rideshare drivers on Uber in the U.S. We document a roughly 7% gender earnings gap amongst drivers. We show that this gap can be entirely attributed to three factors: experience on the platform (learning-by-doing), preferences and constraints over where to work (driven largely by where drivers live and, to a lesser extent, safety), and preferences for driving speed. We do not find that men and women are differentially affected by a taste for specific hours, a return to within-week work intensity, or customer discrimination. Our results suggest that, in a ‚Äúgig‚Äù economy setting with no gender discrimination and highly flexible labour markets, women‚Äôs relatively high opportunity cost of non-paid-work time and gender-based differences in preferences and constraints can sustain a gender pay gap.","6",1,"6","Political",5,1
228,68,"https://doi.org/10.1037/pspi0000166","Five studies found preliminary evidence that White liberals present less competence to a Black (versus White) interaction partner. The competence downshift emerged among self-identified Democrats in Study 1, self-reported liberals in Studies 2 and 3, values-based liberals (i.e., low-RWA Whites) in Study 3, and hierarchy-based liberals (i.e., low-SDO Whites) in Study 5. These liberal Whites presented significantly less competence to a Black interaction partner than they did to a White interaction partner. Specifically, these White liberals presented less competence (Studies 2 and 3) and used fewer competence-related words (Studies 1 and 5) when responding with a Black interaction partner than with a White one. While liberals also tended to describe themselves as less competent in Study 4, though this effect did not reach significance (ps > .115). Across all studies, shifts in White conservatives‚Äô self-presentation of competence did not reach significance (see Study S1 for an exception, wherein conservatives engaged in a competence upshift). Ultimately, White liberals were more likely than White conservatives to present less competence to a Black (versus White) interaction partner. Main effects of partner race emerged in Studies 1 and 2‚Äî overall, politicians (Study 1) and students (Study 2) presented significantly less competence to mostly minority audiences than to mostly-White ones (Study 1) and to a Black interaction partner than to a White one (Study 2). This main effect, although unexpected, is compelling and does not provide evidence against the hypothesis‚Äîin these studies the competence downshift reached significance among White liberals but not White conservatives. Main effects may have emerged in these studies because they constituted conservative tests of the hypothesis. Study 1 tested self-presentation in a political context, wherein all speakers (Democrats and Republicans alike) likely wish to affiliate with minority audiences. As such, even Republicans may be more likely to engage in competence downshift. Study 2 tested self-presentation among students in a largely liberal northeastern university, wherein all respondents are likely to be more liberal than the broader population. As such even relatively conservative respondents may be more likely to engage in a competence downshift. Researchers seeking to replicate and extend this work should carefully consider the contexts and sample populations that could reduce variability in affiliative interaction goals (e.g., persuasive contexts) and speaker conservatism (e.g., student samples).The competence downshift is a subtle but persistent effect that is unique to White liberals. The authors tend to subscribe to the notion that, although no single study can provide a conclusive answer to the ‚Äúrealness‚Äù of a phenomenon, a series of replications can do so more successfully. In all studies but one (Study 4), at least one indicator of conservatism revealed a significant competence downshift among liberal respondents (an exception is found in Study S1, see the Supplemental Materials for details). An internal meta-analysis revealed that, across studies, the competence downshift was significant among self-reported liberals and hierarchy based liberals. Separate examination of the effects found within each study (see Table 6) reveals that, importantly, the pattern of results is consistent across studies for each indicator of conservatism. However, no one indicator of conservatism significantly predicted a competence downshift for each study. The competence downshift reached significance among self-reported liberals in 3 out of 6 studies, among values-based liberals in one of three studies, and among hierarchy-based liberals in one of four studies.The current studies examine shifts in verbal self-presentation that may be especially subtle and difficult to detect. This phenomenon merits replication and extension, as even effect sizes of small-to-moderate magnitude can have societal significance. Replication efforts should include attempts to increase power. Potential strategies include: (a) increasing the systematic variance with more extreme manipulations (e.g., expose participants to more dynamic visual stimuli such as photographs, video, or face-to-face interactions with Black or White confederates), (b) reducing random error with a repeated measures design (i.e., expose participants to both a White and a Black interaction partner, test withinsubject differences), or (c) reducing random error with increased sample sizes. As an exploratory step, we conducted power analyses to determine the sample size required to detect the effects found for each conservatism measure based on the results of the internal meta-analysis. A priori sample size calculation (G Power [Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007], point biserial model,_x0008_  .05, 90% power) revealed the following total sample requirements to detect the effects found among White liberals for each conservatism measure: 805 participants (self-reported liberals), 1146 participants (hierarchy-based liberals), and 2271 participants (values-based liberals). The authors hope that other researchers make efforts to replicate and extend this work, and caution them to strongly consider the time and resources required to recruit the participants necessary to reliably detect the competence downshift as found across these studies.The demographics of MTurk samples are significantly more population-representative than those of other convenience samples, such as college students (Berinsky et al., 2012; Buhrmester et al., 2011; Casler et al., 2013; Mason & Suri, 2012; Paolacci et al., 2010)). Nonetheless, one could question the generalizability of the competence downshift, tested experimentally with social scenarios that featured hypothetical Black or White interaction partners (Studies 2‚Äì 4) and an ostensibly real but still online interaction partner (Study 5). However, Study 1 provided initial evidence of the competence downshift in real-word speech, addressing the generalizability of the competence downshift by examining political campaign speeches from White Democratic or Republican presidential candidates that were addressed to mostly-White versus mostly-minority audiences. Although Democratic candidates tended to speak to minority audiences more often than did Republicans (at least according to this search for such speeches), Democratic candidates more so than Republicans presented less competence to mainly-minority audiences than to mostly-White audiences. Indeed, liberal White politicians have presented less competence to minority audiences than to White audiences over the course of decades.White liberals did not show significant changes in warmth based on the race of an interaction partner, suggesting that the competence-based stereotypes applied to Blacks may drive these changes in liberals‚Äô self-presentation. Collectively, these studies suggest that, for those Whites who are more affiliative toward minorities‚Äîthat is, liberals‚Äîstereotypes may play a role in the impression management strategies utilized in affiliation attempts, relating to a well-intentioned, but ultimately patronizing competence downshift.Liberals did not engage in this competence downshift explicitly. Across studies, White liberals did not admit to a desire to appear less competent (or more warm) with a Black partner than with a White one. A notable exception includes Study 5, wherein liberals across conservatism measures reported having the goal to appear less competent to a Black interaction partner than to a White one. This finding highlights the covert nature of the competence downshift strategy.Finally, Study 5 revealed a discrepancy between verbal selfpresentation of competence and perceived affiliation goals. As noted, hierarchy-based liberals displayed a difference in the competence presented to a Black (versus White) interaction partner: presenting less competence to Black partners than they did to White partners. Their conservative counterparts showed no such difference in their own verbal self-presentation. However, judges blind to presenter conservatism and partner race perceived such liberals to be the egalitarian ones‚Äîthat is, wishing to affiliate equally with a Black or a White partner‚Äîand conservatives to be the discriminatory ones‚Äîthat is, wishing to affiliate with a Black partner less than with a White one. Not only do White liberals engage in a competence downshift (Studies 1‚Äì3, 5) and report wishing to be seen as less competent by a Black partner than by a White one (Study 5), but they also are viewed as more egalitarian than their conservative counterparts by third-party observers.Future DirectionsPrior research has rarely examined self-presentation across racial lines, and this research constitutes the first investigation of the moderating role that individual differences in sociopolitical preferences and beliefs may play in impression management in intergroup settings. These studies provide a first step by illuminating impression management strategies used in interracial contexts by Whites who vary in self-reported conservatism and the two most well-researched measures of sociopolitical conservatism (i.e., SDO and RWA). However, because this research constitutes a preliminary examination of a novel phenomenon, future research is needed to refine and expand up on the current findings.First, future research is needed to determine when different types of liberals will engage in the competence downshift. The current work provides initial evidence that self-identified Democrats (in Study 1), self-reported liberals (in Studies 2 and 3), values-based liberals (in Study 3), and hierarchy-based liberals (in Study 5) do engage in a competence downshift toward racial minorities. However, although the effect was in the predicted direction across all indicators of conservatism in Studies 1‚Äì5, no one measure of sociopolitical conservatism significantly predicted the competence downshift in each study. That being said, metaanalysis revealed that, across studies, self-identified liberalism‚Äîconservatism most reliably predicted liberals‚Äô competence downshift. Furthermore, Study 1 reveals that, when the stakes are high enough (as they are in a presidential campaign), membership in the liberal political party is enough to predict the use of this selfpresentational response. However, the conditions under which a certain type of conservatism will predict this phenomenon remain unclear.Second, further work needs to delve deeper into the proposed mechanisms that drive the competence downshift as expressed by White liberals. Overall, liberals‚Äô (specifically, self-reported liberals‚Äô and hierarchy-based liberals‚Äô) self-presentation of competence, rather than warmth, significantly differed based on partner race. This is likely attributable to stereotypes differentiating Blacks from Whites, which fall in the dimension of competence. Previous research indicates that Whites are aware that Blacks and Latinos are characterized as less intelligent than higher status groups (Devine & Elliot, 1995; Fiske et al., 2002; Krueger, 1996; Weaver, 2007). Furthermore, members of high-status groups tend to believe that they are considered racist by minorities (Vorauer et al., 1998), which may give them the goal of appearing warm during intergroup interactions (Bergsieker et al., 2010). Although the current explanation for the competence downshift holds theoretical and empirical merit, further research is needed to detangle these two proposed mechanisms: the desire to affiliate, and the use of stereotypes to do so.Examining awareness of the competence downshift as an impression management response may provide insight on the causal mechanisms that explain this response. While hierarchy-based conservatives anticipated being seen as more competent by a Black partner than by a White one, hierarchy-based liberals anticipated being seen as (nonsignificantly) less competent by a Black partner than by a White one (Study 5). These liberals may recognize their chosen self-presentational response‚Äîand believe that it will make them appear less stereotypically high in status to a Black partner. This could provide initial evidence of the strategic nature of the liberals‚Äô competence downshift. However, open questions remain. To what extent does each factor‚Äîthe desire to affiliate with minorities and the use of stereotypical knowledge to do so‚Äîexplain the use of a competence downshift strategy? What additional factors may be involved in this likely well-meaning but ultimately patronizing behavior? These constitute intriguing questions for future research.Furthermore, future research might further examine boundary conditions of the competence downshift phenomenon. Familiarity with a minority partner may constitute one such boundary condition, attenuating the competence downshift for liberal Whites, as they rely less on stereotypes. Given that liberals are more open to relationships with Blacks (Eastwick, Richeson, Son, & Finkel, 2009; Yancey, 2007), familiarity with a Black partner may reduce the patronizing behavior shown in these studies by decreasing liberal Whites‚Äô reliance on stereotypes as a method of affiliation.Whites‚Äô self-presentation toward other ethnic outgroup members may reveal an additional boundary condition. Do liberals present less competence to outgroups that are not stereotyped as less competent than Whites (e.g., Asian Americans)? Following up on this possibility, researchers may find that White liberals may present less warmth to this particular outgroup, as Asians are often stereotyped as being colder (though no less intelligent) than Whites (Fiske et al., 2002; Lin, Kwan, Cheung, & Fiske, 2005). Such a finding would provide further support for a stereotyping explanation of the effects found in the current work. If, however, White liberals do engage in a competence downshift toward Asian American interaction partners, that would suggest a compensation effect (Holoien & Fiske, 2013) may be at play‚Äîin efforts to affiliate (i.e., appear warmer) to any outgroup member, White liberals use the general impression management strategy of downplaying their competence.Finally, future work would do well to examine the second reliable pattern effect found in the current work: across studies, White liberals tended to present more competence to a White interaction partner than did White conservatives. This second simple effect was not predicted. A stereotyping explanation may also apply here. In this case, White liberals may label other Whites as more competent than do White conservatives, prompting them to upshift their competence in the presence of other Whites relative to their more conservative counterparts. Future research is needed to replicate and further examine this possibility.LimitationsThese studies are not without limitations. Though the current paper frames the shift in competence as an outgroup-focused competence downshift, this could also be viewed as an ingroupfocused competence upshift. Future tests of the competence downshift should include a baseline condition, wherein no name or avatar is given for the partner at all. These baseline selfpresentation results can then be compared with those in the racial ingroup or outgroup partner conditions, shedding more light on how an ingroup or outgroup interaction partner can affect selfpresentation of warmth or competence. Whites, however, tend to most commonly interact with other Whites (McPherson, SmithLovin, & Cook, 2001; Rugh & Massey, 2010), so quite likely such a baseline target would be assumed to be White. For this reason, the current research approaches these findings as an outgroupfocused competence downshift. Furthermore, race is often confounded with status; as such, the use of stereotypically White or stereotypically Black names may bolster this confound. Study 5 began to address this issue by using White or Black avatars in addition to less obviously stereotypical names. Additionally, Study 1 provided evidence of the competence downshift in a real-world setting, without the use of stereotypically Black names. However, future studies attempting to replicate the competence downshift may consider using visual images exclusively to reduce the potential confound of status.ConclusionIn many ways, America is becoming a more egalitarian nation. Whites show increased support for minority political candidates (Garcia & Tate, 2013; Tesler & Sears, 2010), indicate more positive sentiments toward social policies that benefit minorities (Bobo, 2001), and express less explicit prejudice against outgroups (Bergsieker et al., 2012; Devine & Elliot, 1995; Dovidio & Gaertner, 1986; Fiske, 2002). However, recent research has scarcely examined the more interpersonal level of self-presentation across racial lines. Despite the progress toward egalitarian goals, indirect indicators of bias remain, along with negative stereotypes that characterize minorities as less intelligent than Whites. Although the nation as a whole has shown a degree of progress in recent decades, individual variability in holding egalitarian sociopolitical attitudes remains. Ironically, those who are less explicitly antagonistic toward minorities may be more likely to display such indirect forms of bias, drawing on negative stereotypes to affiliate with Blacks.","Most Whites, particularly sociopolitical liberals, now endorse racial equality. Archival and experimental research reveals a subtle but persistent ironic consequence: White liberals self-present less competence to minorities than to other Whites‚Äîthat is, they patronize minorities stereotyped as lower status and less competent. In an initial archival demonstration of the competence downshift, Study 1 examined the content of White Republican and Democratic presidential candidates‚Äô campaign speeches. Although Republican candidates did not significantly shift language based on audience racial composition, Democratic candidates used less competence-related language to minority audiences than to White audiences. Across 5 experiments (total N = 2,157), White participants responded to a Black or White hypothetical (Studies 2, 3, 4, S1) or ostensibly real (Study 5) interaction partner. Three indicators of self-presentation converged: competence-signaling of vocabulary selected for an assignment, competence-related traits selected for an introduction, and competence-related content of brief, open-ended introductions. Conservatism indicators included self-reported political affiliation (liberal-conservative), Right-Wing Authoritarianism (values-based conservatism), and Social Dominance Orientation (hierarchy-based conservatism). Internal meta-analyses revealed that liberals‚Äîbut not conservatives‚Äîpresented less competence to Black interaction partners than to White ones. The simple effect was small but significant across studies, and most reliable for the self-reported measure of conservatism. This possibly unintentional but ultimately patronizing competence-downshift suggests that well-intentioned liberal Whites may draw on low-status/competence stereotypes to affiliate with minorities.

229,68,"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721418817755","The four psychological features discussed here suggest that political extremism is fueled by feelings of distress and is reflected in cognitive simplicity, overconfidence, and intolerance. These insights are important to understanding how political polarization increases political instability and the likelihood of conflict between groups in society. Excessive confidence in the moral superiority of one‚Äôs own ideological beliefs impedes meaningful interaction and cooperation with different ideological groups and structures political decision making as a zero-sum game with winners and losers. Strong moral convictions consistently decrease people‚Äôs ability to compromise and even increase a willingness to use violence to reach ideological goals (Skitka, 2010). These processes are exacerbated by people‚Äôs tendency to selectively expose themselves to people and ideas that validate their own convictions. For instance, both information and misinformation selectively spread in online echo chambers of like-minded people (Del Vicario et al., 2016).This article extends current insights in at least three ways. First, the features proposed here help to explain why throughout the past century not only extreme-right but also extreme-left movements (e.g., socialism, communism) have thrived in times of crisis (Midlarsky, 2011). Second, understanding the mind-set of extremists in all corners of the political spectrum is important in times of polarization and populist rhetoric. The current propositions provide insights into why traditionally moderate parties in the EU have suffered substantial electoral losses. In particular, the support for well-established parties on the moderate left (e.g., social democrats) and moderate right (e.g., Christian democrats) has dropped in recent years, whereas the support for left- and right-wing populist parties has increased (Krouwel, 2012). Third, the present arguments are based on evidence from multiple countries with different political systems (van Prooijen & Krouwel, 2017), which suggests that they apply to both two-party systems (e.g., the United States) and multiparty systems (e.g., many European countries).Of importance, the features presented here can have both negative and positive societal implications. Many movements that were once considered radical have been responsible for important social change (e.g., human-rights movements). For instance, in the study by Tetlock and colleagues (1994), not only extreme slavery advocates but also extreme abolitionists showed decreased integrative complexity compared with people considered moderate at the time; however, few people nowadays would dispute that the abolitionists were morally right (it indeed requires little cognitive complexity to conclude that slavery is wrong). People can endorse both harmful oversimplifications and simple moral truths with high confidence; moreover, intolerance of hate-driven ideological movements (e.g., White supremacism) can be compatible with moral progress.To conclude, although there are important psychological differences between people with left-wing and people with right-wing ideologies, there are also substantial similarities between left- and right-wing extremists that differentiate them from political moderates. The features presented here provide a psychological perspective on political extremism and contribute to a more complete understanding of how political ideology predicts human cognition, emotion, and behavior.","In this article, we examine psychological features of extreme political ideologies. In what ways are political left- and right-wing extremists similar to one another and different from moderates? We propose and review four interrelated propositions that explain adherence to extreme political ideologies from a psychological perspective. We argue that (a) psychological distress stimulates adopting an extreme ideological outlook; (b) extreme ideologies are characterized by a relatively simplistic, black-and-white perception of the social world; (c) because of such mental simplicity, political extremists are overconfident in their judgments; and (d) political extremists are less tolerant of different groups and opinions than political moderates. In closing, we discuss how these psychological features of political extremists increase the likelihood of conflict among groups in society.","4",0,"4","Political",4,0

Journal of Financial Economics, 113(2), 215‚Äì234. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2014.04.004","ConclusionFor a long list of investment ‚Äúbiases,‚Äù including lack of diversification, excessive trading, and the disposition effect, we find that genetic differences explain up to 45% of the remaining variation across individual investors, after controlling for observable individual characteristics. Our results provide the first direct evidence from real-world, non-experimental data that persistent investment behaviors are to a significant extent determined by genetic endowments.The importance of genetic relative to environmental factors is found to vary across different investors. Most importantly, among investors with finance-related work experience, we find a significant reduction of the relative amount of genetic variation, which is consistent with practical experience in finance moderating genetic predispositions. Interestingly, general education does not seem to have a similar moderating effect.These results have implications for the design of public policy in the domain of financial literacy (e.g., Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007; Van Rooij, Lusardi, and Alessie, 2011). Specifically, the evidence suggests that policy should be designed accounting for the existence of genetic predispositions to investment biases and considering the challenges in reducing such biases. Some contemporaneous research has reached similar conclusions. For example, Bhattacharya, Hackethal, Kaesler, Loos, and Meyer (2012) show in a large field study that investors who are offered unbiased investment advice often are not interested in the advice and even those who are interested generally do not follow the advice.So what explains the genetic effects we find? As argued in Table 1 of our paper, recent research in behavioral genetics has related specific genes to several of the psychological mechanisms that may manifest themselves as investment biases. That is, some individuals are endowed with genes related to familiarity (e.g., Chew, Ebstein, and Zhong, 2011), overconfidence (e.g., Cesarini, Johannesson, Lichtenstein, and Wallace, 2009b), or sensation-seeking (e.g., Derringer, Krueger, Dick, Saccone, Grucza, Agrawal, Lin, Almasy, Edenberg, Foroud, Nurnberger, Hesselbrock, Kramer, Kuperman, Porjesz, Schuckit, and Bierut, 2010), and these genes may manifest themselves in the individual◊≥s investment behavior, as well as in the individual◊≥s behavior in other, non-investment domains. An additional explanation for some of our results, which is consistent with recent work in finance (e.g., Grinblatt et al., 2011, Grinblatt et al., 2012), is that variation in IQ is genetic, which results in genetic variation in investment biases.Future researchWe see several directions for future research related to the genetics of investment biases. First, while recent studies in molecular genetics, using DNA-level data, have confirmed the importance of genetic differences (for height and IQ) first documented using twin studies (Jian et al., 2010, Davies et al., 2011), the relative variation that can be explained by individual candidate genes has so far remained low, rarely exceeding 10%. With the increasing availability of large genetic data sets, we expect that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that consider a very large number of genes can be applied to complex, economic behaviors, including investment biases. Such studies might reveal that a large number of genes is required to successfully predict differences between individual investors.22Second, we have examined the genetic correlations among the investment biases (not tabulated). The magnitudes of these correlations are generally rather low. Perhaps the most interesting result from this exercise, given that we are not aware of any candidate genes mapped to representativeness so far (see Table 1), is a positive genetic correlation of 0.23 between Performance chasing and Skewness preference. This suggests that the same set of genes that contribute to performance chasing may also help to explain the preference for skewness, but further interdisciplinary research is required to fully understand these relationships.Finally, while we focus on genetics in this paper, it is important to emphasize that the environment also affects investment biases, either directly or as a moderator of genetic predispositions. Indeed, more than 50% of the variation in investment biases across investors is attributable to individual-specific experiences and events. Interestingly, our results show that first-order individual characteristics leave most of the variation in investment biases unexplained. This suggests that the environmental factors and mechanisms representing these individual-specific experiences and events could also be complex, possibly consisting of many particular experiences, and their interactions. Future research should further examine which specific experiences (e.g., early in an individual◊≥s life or career) are most important when it comes to determining investment behaviors.","For a long list of investment ‚Äúbiases,‚Äù including lack of diversification, excessive trading, and the disposition effect, we find that genetic differences explain up to 45% of the remaining variation across individual investors, after controlling for observable individual characteristics. The evidence is consistent with a view that investment biases are manifestations of innate and evolutionary ancient features of human behavior. We find that work experience with finance reduces genetic predispositions to investment biases. Finally, we find that even genetically identical investors, who grew up in the same family environment, often differ substantially in their investment behaviors due to individual-specific experiences or events.","Apolitical",0,"Apolitical","Apolitical",5,1

Feminist Economics, 1‚Äì32. https://doi.org/10.1080/13545701.2024.2413914","In recent years, the Chinese government has been vigorously promoting ‚Äúflexible employment‚Äù to mitigate employment pressure. However, we have not found decisive evidence that such policies have achieved the ideal of ‚Äúflexicurity.‚Äù According to our calculation of the flexibility and security indices using data from CLDS 2018, we find that the rising flexibility related to the expansion of precarious work will trap women workers into an increasingly insecure situation which tends to enlarge, rather than reduce, the gender wage gap.

To comprehensively understand the disparities between intended and actual policy outcomes, we draw from Marxist-feminist theories of social reproduction to scrutinize the development of China‚Äôs social reproduction regimes. Specifically, we analyzed the rise and nature of China‚Äôs current developmentalist social reproduction regime that mobilizes as much labor as possible to maintain economic growth. Under this regime, an expansion of precarious work will lead to a shift of social reproduction cost from capital to labor, and women precarious workers will disproportionately bear the brunt of the rising social reproduction cost. Trapped in a predicament where security is compromised for meager flexibility in a deteriorating situation, we argue that Chinese women workers will experience a widening gender wage gap in precarious work.

Based on our further theorization of the ‚Äúreserve army effect‚Äù and the ‚Äúdomestic labor effect,‚Äù we examined the relationship between precarious work and the gender wage gap in China using individual-level data from CLDS 2018 and the regression techniques of Heckman Two-Step regressions and the Oaxaca‚ÄìBlinder method of decomposition. A positive, significant, and robust correlation is found between precarious work and the gender wage gap, which supports our theorization.

We also provide several politically and economically feasible policy suggestions that aim to transferring social reproduction costs back to capital. We contend that the expansion of the employment in the state-owned economy, implementation of a universal basic income project, and the formalization of precarious work will effectively mitigate the adverse impacts of the developmentalist social reproduction regime.","Rapid expansion of precarious employment carries risks of exacerbating the gender wage gap in China. This article finds an inverse relationship between flexibility and security in the labor market, disproportionately affecting women workers. Drawing from the Marxist-feminist theory of social reproduction, the study conceptualizes China‚Äôs social reproduction regime as developmentalist, characterized by ongoing tension between economic development and social reproduction. Promoting precarious work, which reflects the operational logic of the developmentalist social reproduction regime, is essentially transferring social reproduction cost from capital to labor. This cost is predominantly shouldered by precarious workers, particularly women, resulting in a widened gender wage gap. Using the China Labor-force Dynamic Survey, the study finds empirical support for the theorization that the gender wage gap among precarious workers is significantly larger than among non-precarious workers. The article proposes policies addressing the gap by shifting the cost of social reproduction from labor back to capital. HIGHLIGHTS Gender wage gap is wider among precarious workers in China. Marxist-feminist theories help us to better understand GWG in precarious work. Women in precarious work face income loss risks and heavier domestic responsibilities. Developmentalist social reproduction regime seeks to balance growth and reproduction. The cost of social reproduction should be shifted back to capital.","1",0,"1","Political",1,0

Videos are a scalable way to communicate the importance of economic freedom to human fourishing. That we did not afect all participants with videos is unsurprising since those who, at baseline, support economic freedom at high levels are near a ceiling independent of the treatment efect. Rather, it was California residents and those receiving high amounts of government aid who had low baseline support for economic freedom and whose support was increased by the videos.A key fnding is that there was no one ""best"" video to communicate about economic freedom since two diferent videos infuenced two diferent groups. The aspects of each video that were most compelling were found by inspecting the Immersion time-series. Immersion peaks revealed the parts of each video that were most valued neurologically and thus are most likely to be remembered (Zak, 2022). For V1 (Arthur Brooks), the most important points made were, in order of highest Immersion (paraphrasing for context): (i) earned success is truly the key to happiness [35 s-40 s], (ii) earned success brings happiness [26 s-32 s], and (iii) pay attention to faith, family, community, and work [13 s-22 s]. Brooks is speaking on a stage so there is no variation in the visual content. The peak Immersion moments of V2 (developing country market liberalization) were (i) billions of people have been lifted out of abject poverty due to free markets, [21 s-27 s], ii) In India in the 1990s, inequality rose after market reforms yet the poor were better of [47 s-53 s], and iii) critics of free markets contend that the poor are treated better under socialism [1 s-6 s]. This video used animated graphics illustrating the spoken audio. In summary: the most important points in V1 have to do with happiness while V2 focused on the improving the plight of the poor. Future studies may want to focus communication about economic freedom using these two themes.Although we showed that a single video exposure increased support for economic freedom, it is unlikely that a single communication will have lasting efects (Skurka & Keating, 2024; Tucker, 2015). The rhetoric about socialism is emotionally compelling suggesting that it has substantial infuence on opinions (Moussa et al., 2020); Zhang & Kang, 2024). A program to increase support for economic freedom must be compelling and continuous. This means fnding or creating a larger library of videos, testing them for high Immersion, and selectively sharing these videos on the distribution channels frequented by targeted groups. Indeed, the library of videos we built and tested for neurologic Immersion was likely too small. The modest results we report are due, in part, to the lack of emotionally compelling content (Zak, 2022). That is, the videos we selected for Study 1 all had moderate to low levels of average Immersion indicating weak emotional resonance. Moreover, the PANAS data showed the selected videos did not signifcantly change self-reported afect. Related studies using videos that were measured for neurologic Immersion have found that emotional responses mediate their efects on behavior (Barraza & Zak, 2009; Lin et al., 2022; Morris et  al., 2019). While we were aware of the need for emotionally-engaging content explaining the importance of economic freedom, we were unable to locate these for testing. Future research should extend our results by fnding, or creating, higher Immersion videos. It is also worth noting that we established baseline support for economic freedom absent the use of a neutral video as has been done in other studies (Barraza et al., 2015; Morris et al., 2019). The efect on baseline values due to a neutral video was expected to be negligible, though this could be tested in future research.Even given these shortcomings, a single video treatment increased support for economic freedom between 5 and 10%. This is a meaningful increase for a single exposure study (Alcott & Rogers, 2014; O‚ÄôKeefe & Hoeken (2021). Nevertheless, we were unable to infuence support for economic freedom among several groups that had low baseline values, including those with low incomes, members of the Democrat political party, women, and younger adults. Of course, there is signifcant overlap in these groups, but focused communication to narrowly-defned groups is more efective than broad-based information (An et al., 2021; Matz et al., 2017). For example, increases in economic freedom generally have outsized efects for those on the lowest end of the income spectrum both internationally and across the US states (Belasen & Hafer, 2012; Ghering, 2013; Imtiaz & Bashir, 2017), though this may not always hold (Migheli & Saccone, 2023). Poverty reduction due to increased economic freedom should be of interest to lower income individuals, the young, and people without college degrees and may therefore increase their understanding of, and support for, economic liberalization. More generally, economic freedom increases happiness and well-being broadly understood (Graafand & Compen, 2015; Nikolaev, 2014; Pitlik & Rode, 2016) and this, too, should be communicated to low support groups whose stated focus is on others‚Äô welfare including Democrats and women (Krimmel & Rader, 2021; Shorrocks and Grasso, (2020).Our analysis of feature importance generally supported the mean diference fndings that identifed demographic groups with low support for economic freedom. It is unsurprising that those receiving government aid are unsupportive of economic freedom, but the size efect was unexpectedly large. As a result, our data suggest this is the key demographic that needs efective messaging about the importance of economic freedom. The approach described herein is easily adapted to editing newly created content for high Immersion so that it efectively communicates the importance of economic freedom while producing a strong emotional response that helps to sustain its efect.The quantitatively second most important factor was age and since developed and middle-income countries are now rapidly aging (Dogra, et  al., 2022), support for economic freedom may endogenously increase. Estimates indicate that by 2050, 20% of the world‚Äôs population will be over the age of 65 (Dogra, et al., 2022). This may have a two-fold efect on accelerating support for economic freedom via aging and because incomes typically rise with age and high income was the sixth most important factor afecting support for economic freedom.The feature importance analysis also shows Democrats and Republicans are on the expected diferent sides of support for economic liberalization consistent with previous fndings (Fuller & Geide-Stevenson, 2007). In medium and lower income countries, democracies tend to promote economic freedom more than dictatorial regimes, although right-leaning autocrats sometimes support freer economic policies (Castro & Martins, 2021). The rapid growth of democracies after the fall of the Soviet Union certainly encouraged economic liberalization but the recent rise of left- and right-leaning populist regimes makes it difcult to assess if political regimes will promote or inhibit economic freedom (Bergh & K√§rn√§, 2024).Much work needs to be done to communicate the importance of economic freedom that will have the impact of the well-structured and produced Keynes vs. Hayek rap videos. We have shown that videos not produced to explicitly infuence support for economic freedom or to stimulate a discussion about this topic, still infuence those in two groups that had low support for economic freedom. Future work that seeks to increase support for economic freedom should invest in developing human-scale storylines with strong emotional appeals and high production values in order to efectively communicate the importance of this topic (Zak, 2022). Indeed, recent advances in wearable technologies that continuously measure thriving neurologically (Merritt et al., 2022; Merritt & Zak, 2024) could be used to objectively compare those living in regions with high vs. low economic freedom. Such a rich data set would provide objective neurophysiologic evidence showing that economic freedom improves fourishing for individuals and societies.","The relationship between economic freedom and improvements in social and economic outcomes is well-documented. Yet, increasing support for government control of voluntary exchange has arisen in the US and many other countries. The present study analyzed whether videos describing human fourishing would infuence support for economic freedom. In Study 1, a ‚Äò‚Äòbrain as predictor‚Äô‚Äô approach measured the neurologic responses of participants (N=64) to a library of videos in order identify the videos most likely to infuence people‚Äôs attitudes. Study 2 then sent two videos to a representative sample of US adults (N=1212) and assessed support for economic freedom compared to a no-video control group. The analysis frst identifed demographic categories that had statistically low support for economic freedom (Californians, those with low incomes, Democrats, young adults, individuals without a college education, people receiving substantial government support, and women) as targets for infuence. Two diferent videos increased support for economic freedom between 5 and 10% among Californians and among those receiving government aid. A feature importance analysis was used to rank the demographic factors afecting support for economic freedom, identifying those receiving government aid as the group for whom future messaging would have the largest impact.","7",0,"7","Political",6,0

One of the main critiques of the SRI industry is that it doesn't manage enough funds to affect stock prices and thus change firm behavior. However, this critique ignores the much larger pool of investment capital controlled by Democratic investors (whose underweighting of PSI or tilting toward high-KLD stocks is about 50% of that of SRI funds). Survey data show that Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents make up approximately 50% of the U.S. adult population.9 So while institutional asset managers are more likely to be Republican, the split in our sample suggests that there is still a sizeable fraction of Democrats, and hence the portfolio decisions of Democrats are still likely to have an important effect on stock prices.
Moreover, note that since politically sensitive industries are such a small share (less than 4%) of the total stock market, the economic implications for capital allocation are likely to be relatively minor when measured on this dimension. However, we also find that Democrats invest more money in companies that are better corporate citizens (have higher KLD scores) including overweighting firms that implement ‚Äúpositive‚Äù policies (KLD strengths) rather than just screening out those that face scandals or problems (KLD concerns). The fact that such a large group of investors (Democrats) potentially care about corporate social responsibility and invest accordingly could affect the cost of capital of firms in all industries and motivate improvements in community programs, employee relations, environmental records, and other forms of corporate social responsibility.
5. Conclusion
In this paper, we ask whether political values influence investment decisions. We use data on the political contributions and stockholdings of U.S. mutual fund managers and find a surprising answer: managers who donate to Democrats underweight (relative to non-donors or Republican donors) stocks that are deemed socially irresponsible (e.g., tobacco, guns and defense, natural resources, and firms with low KLD scores). This effect is approximately one-half of the underweighting observed for socially responsible (SRI) mutual funds. This finding is robust, and our findings are similar when we focus on the holdings of hedge fund managers. The finding is surprising because our sample is composed of large professional money managers who are important marginal price setters in markets. Hence, it suggests that as the SRI movement grows, its impact on asset prices could be substantial. Considering that many professional managers are already practicing ‚Äúcloset SRI,‚Äù it is unlikely that they will provide the contrarian positions needed to stabilize prices in markets.
There is much promising work still to be done on the role of values in investing. Better and more comprehensive data can be collected on not only single-managed funds but also team-managed funds. Similarly, there is much that we do not know about how values influence investing for pension funds. Furthermore, our analysis of the performance associated with political values is only cursory. A deeper analysis into the influence of values on performance should also be conducted.","Using data on the political contributions and stock holdings of U.S. investment managers, we find that mutual fund managers who make campaign donations to Democrats hold less of their portfolios (relative to non-donors or Republican donors) in companies that are deemed socially irresponsible (e.g., tobacco, guns, or defense firms or companies with bad employee relations or diversity records). Although explicit socially responsible investing (SRI) funds are more likely to be managed by Democratic managers, this result holds for non-SRI funds and after controlling for other fund and manager characteristics. The effect is more than one-half of the underweighting observed for SRI funds.","4",0,"4","Political",3,0

This raises the question of how SRI screening affects the financial performance of these portfolios. In this paper, we analyze whether investors can increase their performance by following a simple trading strategy based on SRI ratings: Buy stocks with high SRI ratings and sell stocks with low SRI ratings.

We implement this trading strategy for stocks included in the S&P 500 and the DS 400 for the period 1992‚Äì2004. The stocks are screened based on a variety of criteria and screening policies, and the performance is measured using the Carhart (1997) model. We get the following main results:
(i) Investors can earn remarkably high abnormal returns by following the simple long-short strategy described above.
(ii) They can do so by implementing the positive screening approach or the best-in-class screening approach, but not the negative screening approach.
(iii) The best-in-class approach typically leads to the highest alphas (up to about 8.7% per year).
(iv) The best-in-class screening approach works best when investors use a combination of several SRI screens at the same time and restrict themselves to stocks with extreme SRI ratings.
(v) The alphas stay significant even after taking into account reasonable transaction costs.

Overall, our results suggest that past SRI ratings are valuable information for investors. A simple trading strategy based on this publicly available information leads to high abnormal returns. This immediately raises the question of where this extra profit stems from. Does it result from a temporary mispricing in the market, or does it compensate for an additional risk factor? Answering this question seems to be a promising avenue for future research.","More and more investors apply socially responsible screens when building their stock portfolios. This raises the question whether these investors can increase their performance by incorporating such screens into their investment process. To answer this question we implement a simple trading strategy based on socially responsible ratings from the KLD Research & Analytics: Buy stocks with high socially responsible ratings and sell stocks with low socially responsible ratings. We find that this strategy leads to high abnormal returns of up to 8.7% per year. The maximum abnormal returns are reached when investors employ the bestin-class screening approach, use a combination of several socially responsible screens at the same time, and restrict themselves to stocks with extreme socially responsible ratings. The abnormal returns remain significant even after taking into account reasonable transaction costs.","2",0,"2","Political",3,0

We analyzed the 1992-2007 returns of stocks rated on social responsibility characteris-tics by KLD and found that this tilt gave socially responsible portfolios an advantage over conven-tional portfolios. This finding is consistent with the ""doing good while doing well"" hypothesis, whereby the expected returns of stocks of socially responsible companies are higher than those of conventional companies.Typical socially responsible portfolios, how-ever, also shun stocks of companies associated with tobacco, alcohol, gambling, firearms, and military or nuclear operations. We found that such shun-ning results in a disadvantage for socially respon-sible portfolios relative to conventional portfolios. This finding is consistent with the ""doing good but not well"" hypothesis, whereby the expected returns of socially responsible stocks are lower than those of conventional stocks.For socially responsible portfolios, the advan-tage from the tilt toward stocks of companies with high social responsibility scores is largely offset by the disadvantage from excluding stocks of shunned companies. The net effect is consistent with the ""no effect"" hypothesis, whereby the expected returns of socially responsible stocks are approximately equal to the expected returns of conventional stocks. This finding is consistent with a world in which the social responsibility feature of stocks has no effect on returns. But it is also consistent with the world we found, in which the advantages of some social responsibility criteria are offset by the disadvan-tages of other social criteria.Socially responsible investors can do both well and good by adopting the best-in-class method for the construction of their portfolios. That method calls for tilts toward stocks of compa-nies with high social responsibility scores on such characteristics as community, employee relations, and the environment, but it also calls for refraining from shunning the stocks of any company. Not all socially responsible investors, however, are likely to agree that this best-in-class method qualifies as doing good. The fact that best-in-class portfolios are also tilted toward companies with high ratings on such characteristics as employee relations is unlikely to comfort investors who abhor tobacco companies. Such investors might choose to do well by including the stocks of the best of the tobacco companies in their best-in-class portfolios, but they would probably be unable to ignore their choice to trade doing good for doing well.","Typical socially responsible investors tilt their portfolios toward stocks of companies with high scores on social responsibility characteristics and shun stocks of companies associated with tobacco, alcohol, gambling, firearms, and military or nuclear operations.

The Leadership Quarterly, 25(5), 855‚Äì864. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.2014.07.002","The results show clearly that the ratings of gender-linked traits from CEOs' faces, specifically, higher powerfulness in male CEOs and higher supportiveness, compassion and warmth in female CEOs, predicted better company rank and/or profits. Moreover, higher ratings in a composite of communal traits (compassion, supportiveness, warmth) also predicted better rank and profits for female CEOs, and higher ratings in a composite of agentic traits predicted rank at a marginally significant level. This association of higher ratings for both communal and agentic traits with company rank and profits in women CEOs is consistent with the view that conceptions of leadership are becoming more androgynous (e.g., Koenig et al., 2011). That is, although we found no evidence of an association between communal characteristics and corporate profits or rank for men CEOs, women who are perceived as having higher communal traits are CEOs of companies with better ranks and profits. Ratings of femininity for female CEOs, however, were negatively correlated with company profits, making an intriguing contrast with communal characteristics. Femininity was unrelated to the communal composite, suggesting that further research is needed to examine how raters interpreted the meaning of femininity.Although powerfulness predicted corporate ranking and profits for male CEOs, the agentic composite did not. This is surprising inasmuch as the overlap in stereotypical masculine traits attributed to men and to leaders (Koenig et al., 2011) supports the expectation that male CEOs perceived as having these masculine traits would be the heads of more highly ranked and profitable companies than CEOs without these traits. Indeed, Rule and Ambady (2008) reported a significant correlation between ratings of agentic characteristics and company profits in male CEOs. In the present study, although the agentic composite and company profits were not significantly correlated at the .05 level, the magnitude of the correlation coefficient was similar to that reported for male CEOs by Rule and Ambady (2008). The three traits in Rule and Ambady's agentic composite were represented among the five agentic traits in the present study. Clearly, statistical power in the present study was constrained by the small number of female CEOs in the Fortune 1000. Because we matched company rank for male and female CEOs, the small number of female CEOs limited the number of male CEOs as well.Attractiveness, gender-linked traits and corporate performanceAttractiveness differed for male and female CEOs in its relation to other traits and in its role in predicting rank and profits. For male CEOs, attractiveness was positively correlated with every trait except femininity and facial maturity, suggesting a ‚Äúhalo‚Äù effect wherein attractiveness positively affects judgments about other characteristics of a person (e.g., Dion et al., 1972). In contrast, for female CEOs attractiveness was correlated only with femininity. Although previous meta-analyses report that the positive link between attractive appearance and positive interpersonal and individual traits applies to both men and women (Langlois et al., 2000), it is likely that these studies had considerably more variation in appearance, especially at the extreme end of attractiveness, than in the present study which was limited to CEOs of major companies. Indeed, attractiveness ratings were significantly higher for female than male CEOs and although the variability was similar across gender, the higher attractiveness ratings for female CEOs may have limited the covariance of attractiveness with other traits. An important issue for future research is how the level of attractiveness in a sample moderates the relation of attractiveness to other positive traits.The correlation of attractiveness with profits only became significant for male CEOs after controlling for age, probably because of the negative correlation between age and attractiveness, combined with the small positive relationship between age and company profits. Adding either the agentic or communal composites to a model already containing age and attractiveness did not add significant explanatory power, likely due to the substantial covariation between attractiveness and the traits included in the agentic and communal composites. For women, attractiveness was unrelated to the agentic and communal composites. Attractiveness did become a marginally significant predictor of rank in the regression model containing both age and the agentic composite (see Appendix), but the positive coefficient indicates that higher attractiveness ratings are associated with more poorly ranked companies. Importantly, attractiveness was not a significant predictor of either rank or profits in the models that contained the communal composite. The addition of the communal composite was the only step that significantly improved the explanatory ability of the models.CEO gender, gender-linked traits and corporate performanceThe traits attributed to top corporate leaders based on facial appearance vary according to the gender of the CEO. Male CEOs were rated higher on dominance, leadership and powerfulness and female CEOs were rated higher on compassion, warmth and supportiveness. The two sets of traits correspond to stereotypically masculine and stereotypical feminine traits, respectively (e.g., Bem, 1974, Spence and Buckner, 2000). Indeed, such gender effects would be expected for non-CEOs' faces as well, inasmuch as the ratings in general represent projection of the rater's gender stereotypes (Eagly & Karau, 2002). Although gender stereotypes undoubtedly play a role in ratings of male and female faces on gender-linked traits, this cannot be the only factor driving the ratings because some ratings predicted company rank and profits for men and women CEOs. This finding of significant predictive ability is compatible with previous research demonstrating that ratings based on facial appearance predict objective measures of success (e.g., Berggren et al., 2010, Frieze et al., 1991, Rule and Ambady, 2011, Todorov et al., 2005).Our findings may appear to be inconsistent with Rule and Ambady (2009)'s findings of no CEO gender difference in their ‚Äúcommunal‚Äù traits of likeability and trustworthiness, and no association between ‚Äúcommunal‚Äù traits and company performance. However, there is no evidence that likeability and trustworthiness are gender-linked characteristics. Indeed Bem included them (or a synonym) as traits that are neutral with respect to gender (Bem, 1974, Spence and Buckner, 2000). In the present study the selection of gender-linked traits was evidence based, and thus the relation of communal traits to rank and profits for women CEOs is not inconsistent with Rule and Ambady's null effect for ‚Äúcommunal‚Äù traits.Leadership was the one trait where participant gender interacted with CEO gender: Female and male participants both assigned higher leadership ratings to male CEOs; however this difference was significantly larger for male than female participants. This effect is consistent with previous findings showing that men are more affected than women by gender stereotypes in their conceptions of leadership (e.g., Koenig et al., 2011, Prime et al., 2009). The basic memory representations constituting schemas, such as those that represent stereotypes of leadership, have been shown to affect our perception and memory of experiences (e.g., Wiley, 2005) and this makes schemas difficult to change, even in the face of disconfirming evidence (e.g., Epitropaki & Martin, 2004). Within this framework and consistent with role congruity theory, the classic leadership schema with its overlap with stereotypically masculine traits is incongruous with the perception of women as effective leaders. Such incongruity between women and the leadership stereotype has been implicated in the negative evaluation of women's performance and in creating barriers to women's advancement (Eagly and Karau, 2002, Heilman, 2001, Heilman and Okimoto, 2007).Koenig et al. (2011), however, concluded from a meta-analysis that although stereotypes of leaders remain masculine, the masculine dominance has decreased in recent years because of the inclusion of feminine communal qualities. Indeed, the authors advise women leaders ‚Äúto retain elements of a masculine leadership style to avoid a mismatch with leader roles, even . . . [with] greater flexibility to incorporate elements of a feminine leadership style‚Äù (p. 635). The present study offers no evidence that the perception of communal and agentic traits in women CEOs is causally related to the performance of their companies, or to their selection as CEO. One issue for future research, however, is whether the stereotypically masculine schema for leadership will be altered by the presence of communal-appearing women in top leadership positions.A fundamental issue for future investigation that cannot be addressed in a correlational study is the nature of the mechanism responsible for the relationship between traits inferred from facial appearance and corporate rank and profits. For example, personality traits expressed in facial appearance may reflect behavior such that powerful behavior in men and communal and agentic behavior in women contributed to their selection as a CEO or their companies becoming highly ranked and profitable. Alternatively, their facial appearance may communicate these traits but they may be unassociated with actual behavior; the appearance alone of these traits may nonetheless confer an advantage that contributes to the performance of their companies, or to their selection as CEO. Indeed, Livingston and Pearce (2009) argued that the greater success of baby-faced Black CEOs compared to Black CEOs with more mature faces may have been a result of their warm appearance mitigating racial stereotypes and thus reducing barriers to success. Similarly, female CEOs whose faces appear supportive, compassionate, and warm may mitigate stereotypes about powerful, agentic women as being cold or hostile (Heilman & Okimoto, 2007). We have, however, no evidence for such causal mechanisms in a correlational study. Future investigations must also consider the possibility that companies with better rank and profits may somehow affect the appearance of their executives, or that the relationship between appearance and company performance can be accounted for by third variables.In sum, our findings demonstrate an important relation between subjective ratings of gender-related traits in CEOs' facial appearance and the rank and profits of their company. Regardless of the nature of causality, the positive relationship between ratings of communal traits in women CEOs and corporate financial performance may support a change toward a more androgynous concept of leadership via the association between communal appearance and higher ranked companies. Further research is needed to investigate how and why the appearance of gender-linked traits in CEOs is predictive of the performance of their companies.","This study examined relationships among CEOs' facial appearance, gender-linked traits, and the financial performance of their company as indicated by Fortune 1000 rank and company profits. Na√Øve college students rated traits based solely on the facial appearance of male and female CEOs whose companies were matched by Fortune 1000 rank. Female CEOs were rated higher than male CEOs on communal traits (supportiveness, compassion, warmth), whereas male CEOs were rated higher than female CEOs on agentic traits (dominance, leadership, powerfulness), consistent with social role theory. Correlations with company rank and/or profits were found for powerfulness for male CEOs, and for supportiveness, warmth and compassion for female CEOs. For female CEOs, a communal composite predicted company rank and profits, and an agentic composite marginally predicted company rank. The findings do not indicate why these variables are related, but implications for the association of gender-linked traits with top corporate leaders are discussed.","4",0,"4","Political",4,1

From a risk perspective we argued that exclusions lead to under-diversification and an exposure to unrewarded, diversifiable risk, or tracking error. A high tracking error brings along the risk of significant underperformance compared to peers. We also show how tracking error can be translated into an equivalent loss in expected return, which is negligible at low tracking error levels, but not at higher levels. The tracking error resulting from exclusions may be reduced by selectively overweighting stocks that exhibit return behavior most similar to the excluded stocks. This will typically be easier if the exclusion policy does not rule out entire industries, but leaves room for buying the best-in-class stocks within each industry.

Taking an asset pricing perspective we found that exclusions typically go against established asset pricing factors such as value, profitability, investment, and low risk, leading to lower expected returns. However, if the amount of exclusions is not too drastic it may be possible to offset such undesired factor tilts by increasing the weight of stocks that offer similar factor characteristics. We next discussed whether sin itself could be a priced factor which standard asset pricing models fail to recognize. Although it can be theoretically argued that sin stocks should command a higher average return, there is no strong empirical evidence for the existence of such a sin premium ‚Äì nor for a sin discount for that matter. An important caveat here is that past data may no longer be representative if exclusion policies become successful at raising the cost of capital of sin stocks, which could create a sin premium in the future. In order to offset an additional loss in expected return due to a sin premium, investors could seek additional exposure towards the other priced factors.

Altogether we estimate that naively excluding large numbers of sin stocks can lower the expected equity return by 0.25‚Äì0.50%. Although this might seem small, a pension fund which underperforms its peers by such an amount may end up providing about 5% lower pensions in the long run.Footnote17 The good news, however, is that this performance loss may be prevented, or at least mitigated to a large extent, with more sophisticated portfolio management.","We examine the impact of excluding sin stocks on expected portfolio risk and return.

We show how this tracking error can be translated into an equivalent loss in expected return, which is negligible at low tracking error levels, but not at higher levels.

Taking an asset pricing perspective we find that popular exclusions typically go against rewarded factors such as value, profitability, and low risk, which is harmful for expected portfolio returns. Theoretically sin itself may also be a priced factor, but this is not yet supported by the empirical evidence. Tracking error may be minimized and expected portfolio return restored by filling the gap left by excluding sin stocks with non-sin stocks that offer the best hedging properties and similar or better factor exposures.","4",0,"4","Political",4,0

Specifically, a firm‚Äôs policies related to stakeholders other than the firm‚Äôs shareholders, collectively referred to as corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices, are systematically related to whether or not a firm‚Äôs top executive is the parent of a daughter. Our empirical evidence is consistent with a simple theoretical framework involving a utility-maximizing CEO with social preferences: Women may have stronger other-regarding preferences, CEOs internalize their daughters‚Äô preferences, and this has real implications for decision-making also at the top echelons of Corporate America.In a controversial op-ed piece in the New York Times, Friedman (1970) concluded that ‚ÄúThe Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits.‚Äù One interpretation of our evidence is that CEOs with daughters are less likely to subscribe to this objective function for the firm. In particular, CEOs parenting a daughter may exhibit an increased propensity to pay what we may refer to as a ‚Äústakeholder dividend.‚Äù It would be interesting to estimate the welfare effects of such dividends for shareholders and other stakeholders combined. For example, work-life benefits for employees may or may not benefit a firm‚Äôs shareholders, but may allow working parents to invest more in early-life care for their children, which may benefit their children and society at large and over the longer term (e.g., Cunha, Heckman, Lochner and Masterov, 2006).This study contributes to several active research areas. First, why are some firms more pro-CSR compared to others? Our research emphasizes the role of the executives managing these firms. When a CEO with a daughter is confronted with a corporate decision related to CSR, he may be more likely to make a decision that benefits women or is consistent with the preferences of women. Second, what experiences contribute to shaping CEOs as top corporate decision-makers? While recent research has largely focused on professional and early-career experiences (e.g., Benmelech, Frydman, 2015, Dittmar, Duchin, 2016, Schoar, Zuo, 2017), an emerging set of studies examine personal experiences (e.g., Malmendier, Tate, Yan, 2011, Bernile, Bhagwat, Rau, 2017). Our study is one of the first to emphasize the importance of the family environment in shaping CEOs, contributing a novel and exogenous personal experience to this research area.Future work may explore several different directions. First, while corporate social responsibility is a natural starting point, other corporate policies may also be studied (e.g., Nguyen, 2015). Relevant economic outcomes include those where there are gender differences in preferences (e.g., Croson, Gneezy, 2009, Bertrand, 2011). Recent experimental evidence suggests that parenting a daughter may reduce dishonest behaviors (e.g., Houser, List, Piovesan, Samek and Winter, 2016), possibly also in the corporate domain. Second, while having a daughter is arguably exogenous and possibly one of the strongest female socialization influences, other studies may attempt to study the impact of growing up with a female sibling, attending a college with a strong gender imbalance, and starting the career in a firm with a female CEO or a large surplus of female co-workers.22 Finally, in ‚ÄúThe Case for Mindful Economics,‚Äù Camerer (2008) refers to parent-daughter effects as a direction for where neuroscience may add value to understanding psychological processes in economics.","Corporate executives managing some of the largest public companies in the U.S. are shaped by their daughters. When a firm‚Äôs chief executive officer (CEO) has a daughter, the corporate social responsibility rating (CSR) is about 9.1% higher, compared to a median firm. The results are robust to confronting several sources of endogeneity, e.g., examining first-born CEO daughters and CEO changes. The relation is strongest for diversity, but significant also for broader pro-social practices related to the environment and employee relations. Our study contributes to research on female socialization, heterogeneity in CSR policies, and plausibly exogenous determinants of CEOs‚Äô styles.","4",0,"4","Political",3,1

Climate anxiety in children and young people and their beliefs about government responses to climate change: A global survey. Lancet Planetary Health, 5(12), e863‚Äìe873.","According to our study, children and young people in countries around the world report climate anxiety and other distressing emotions and thoughts about climate change that impact their daily lives. This distress was associated with beliefs about inadequate governmental response and feelings of betrayal. A large proportion of children and young people around the world report emotional distress and a wide range of painful, complex emotions (sad, afraid, angry, powerless, helpless, guilty, ashamed, despair, hurt, grief, and depressed). Similarly, large numbers report experiencing some functional impact and have pessimistic beliefs about the future (people have failed to care for the planet; the future is frightening; humanity is doomed; they won‚Äôt have access to the same opportunities their parents had; things they value will be destroyed; security is threatened; and they are hesitant to have children). These results reinforce findings of earlier empirical research and expand on previous findings by showing the extensive, global nature of this distress, as well as its impact on functioning. Climate distress is clearly evident both in countries that are already experiencing extensive physical impacts of climate change, such as the Philippines, a nation that is highly vulnerable to coastal flooding and typhoons. It is also evident in countries where the direct impacts are still less severe, such as the UK, where populations are relatively protected from extreme weather events. Distress appears to be greater when young people believe that government response is inadequate, which leads us to argue that the failure of governments to adequately reduce, prevent, or mitigate climate change is contributing to psychological distress, moral injury, and injustice.Such high levels of distress, functional impact, and feelings of betrayal will negatively affect the mental health of children and young people. Climate anxiety might not constitute a mental illness, but the realities of climate change alongside governmental failures to act are chronic, long-term, and potentially inescapable stressors. These factors are likely to increase the risk of developing mental health problems, particularly in more vulnerable individuals such as children and young people, who often face multiple life stressors without having the power to reduce, prevent, or avoid such stressors.2, 18, 22, 23 As severe weather events linked with climate change persist, intensify, and accelerate, it follows that, in the absence of mitigating factors, mental health impacts will follow the same pattern. We are already seeing increased severe climatic events that act as the precipitating and perpetuating factors of psychological distress; as of September, 2021, numerous unprecedented weather events have occurred since our data collection (including the heat dome and wildfires in the Pacific Northwest, catastrophic storms and floods in Germany, Iran, China, London, and New York, and heat records repeatedly broken in Northern Ireland and North America).Factors known to protect against mental health problems include psychosocial resources, coping skills, and agency to address and mitigate stressors. In the context of climate anxiety, this protection would come in the form of having one's feelings and views heard, validated, respected, and acted upon, particularly by those in positions of power and upon whom we are dependent, accompanied by collective pro-environmental actions. However, this survey shows that large numbers of young people globally regard governments as failing to acknowledge or act on the crisis in a coherent, urgent way, or respond to their alarm. This is experienced as betrayal and abandonment, not just of the individual but of young people and future generations generally. The results here reflect and expand upon the findings of an earlier interview study, in which young people described their feelings about climate change as being ‚Äústranded by the generational gap‚Äù and feeling ‚Äúfrustrated by unequal power, betrayed and angry, disillusioned with authority, drawing battle lines‚Äù.Defence mechanisms against the anxiety provoked by climate change have been well documented, including dismissing, ignoring, disavowing, rationalising, and negating the experiences of others.27 These behaviours, when exhibited by adults and governments, could be seen as leading to a culture of uncare.27 Thus, climate anxiety in children and young people should not be seen as simply caused by ecological disaster, it is also correlated with more powerful others (in this case, governments) failing to act on the threats being faced. Our findings are in line with this argument and, alongside pre-existing evidence, lend weight to the proposal that climate distress in children and young people can be regarded as unjust and involving moral injury.28 Young people's awareness of climate change and the inaction of governments are seen here to be associated with negative psychological sequelae. Moral injury has been described as ‚Äúa sign of mental health, not disorder‚Ä¶ a sign that one's conscience is alive‚Äù,27 yet it inflicts considerable hurt and wounding because governments are transgressing fundamental moral beliefs about care, compassion, planetary health, and ecological belonging. This sense of the personal, collective, and ecological perspective is summarised in the words of one 16-year-old: ‚ÄúI think it's different for young people. For us the destruction of the planet is personal‚Äù.By endangering and harming fundamental human needs, the climate crisis is also a human rights issue. Legal bodies recognise an intersection between human rights, climate change, and climate anxiety. Subjecting young people to climate anxiety and moral injury can be regarded as cruel, inhuman, degrading, or even torturous.31, 32 This provides further understanding for the current phenomenon of climate criminology,33 in which children and young people are voicing their concerns through legal cases as an attempt to have their distress legitimised and validated legally in the face of government inaction.A complete understanding of climate anxiety in children and young people must encompass these relational, psychosocial, cultural, ethical, legal, and political factors. Current narratives risk individualising the so-called problem of climate anxiety, with suggestions that the best response is for the individual to take action.3 Our results suggest that such action needs to particularly be taken by those in power. To protect the mental health and wellbeing of young people, those in power can act to reduce stress and distress by recognising, understanding, and validating the fears and pain of young people, acknowledging their rights, and placing them at the centre of policy making.23 Before we can offer younger generations a message of hope, we must first acknowledge the obstacles that must be overcome.Limitations of this study include the use of non-standardised measures to investigate the experience of climate anxiety and how people think and feel about government responses, which are complex and nuanced subjects. Unfortunately, no appropriate standardised measures existed for our purposes. The construct of climate anxiety itself is new and complex, with varying definitions across the literature. Although our results show that many young people report difficult thoughts, emotions, and functional impairment related to climate change, we cannot indicate how severe this is in comparison to normative samples. We aimed to investigate whether certain emotions and thoughts were present across different countries in the world, rather than to assess the degree to which these thoughts and feelings are felt. Therefore, we chose to use a three-factor response scale (yes, no, or prefer not to say) to encourage a high response rate and to facilitate valid responses from those less familiar with Likert scales. Although dichotomous response scales can exaggerate acquiescence, having a third, neutral option can mitigate this. This is supported by our finding that statements on negative emotions and beliefs were more commonly endorsed than positive or neutral statements.Without measures of mental health, these results cannot assess how or whether climate anxiety is affecting mental health outcomes in these populations. The study did not measure the severity of climate anxiety by any psychological scale, although it should be noted that some results related to youth cognitions indicate strong emotions, such as the belief that ‚Äúhumanity is doomed‚Äù. Of note, the data were based on equal sample sizes per country and were not weighted according to population size, so aggregated results must be interpreted with caution because they are not globally representative. However, more populous countries (eg, India with more than 1¬∑3 billion people) reported greater levels of worry, functional impairment, negative beliefs, and so on, indicating that our aggregated findings are probably a conservative estimate of distress levels globally. Other limitations arose from the use of an online polling company, for which completion required internet access, and sometimes the ability to speak English. Thus, although the samples should not be biased towards those who are especially concerned about climate change, they are not fully representative of the countries‚Äô populations. Finally, the polling company provided data on gender defined only as male or female, which fails to recognise the non-binary nature of gender.This study's strengths include its large sample size and global reach, and it is a novel and timely investigation into climate anxiety and perceived government response. It offers good representation within countries by using a polling company with proven inclusive participant selection and minimisation of respondent bias by not advertising the nature of the study (eg, climate-related) in advance. We present the results as an initial attempt to quantify the global scale of the psychological impact of climate change and of inadequate government responses upon young people.To conclude, our findings suggest that climate change, climate anxiety, and inadequate government response are all chronic stressors that could threaten the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people around the world. This survey offers a preliminary overview; further, detailed research is required to explore the complexities and wide variety of climate feelings. Climate anxiety is a collective experience,27 and based on our results, children and young people would benefit from having a social discourse in which their thoughts and feelings are respected and validated, and their concerns are acted upon by people in positions of power. Climate anxiety indicates the care and empathy that young people have for our world. As one young person said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to die. But I don‚Äôt want to live in a world that doesn‚Äôt care about children and animals.‚ÄùAs a research team, we were disturbed by the scale of emotional and psychological effects of climate change upon the children of the world, and the number who reported feeling hopeless and frightened about the future of humanity. We wish that these results had not been quite so devastating. The global scale of this study is sufficient to warrant a warning to governments and adults around the world, and it underscores an urgent need for greater responsiveness to children and young people's concerns, more in-depth research, and immediate action on climate change.","Background
Climate change has important implications for the health and futures of children and young people, yet they have little power to limit its harm, making them vulnerable to climate anxiety. This is the first large-scale investigation of climate anxiety in children and young people globally and its relationship with perceived government response.
Methods
We surveyed 10‚Äà000 children and young people (aged 16‚Äì25 years) in ten countries (Australia, Brazil, Finland, France, India, Nigeria, Philippines, Portugal, the UK, and the USA; 1000 participants per country). Invitations to complete the survey were sent via the platform Kantar between May 18 and June 7, 2021. Data were collected on participants‚Äô thoughts and feelings about climate change, and government responses to climate change. Descriptive statistics were calculated for each aspect of climate anxiety, and Pearson's correlation analysis was done to evaluate whether climate-related distress, functioning, and negative beliefs about climate change were linked to thoughts and feelings about government response.Findings
Respondents across all countries were worried about climate change (59% were very or extremely worried and 84% were at least moderately worried). More than 50% reported each of the following emotions: sad, anxious, angry, powerless, helpless, and guilty. More than 45% of respondents said their feelings about climate change negatively affected their daily life and functioning, and many reported a high number of negative thoughts about climate change (eg, 75% said that they think the future is frightening and 83% said that they think people have failed to take care of the planet). Respondents rated governmental responses to climate change negatively and reported greater feelings of betrayal than of reassurance. Climate anxiety and distress were correlated with perceived inadequate government response and associated feelings of betrayal.
Interpretation
Climate anxiety and dissatisfaction with government responses are widespread in children and young people in countries across the world and impact their daily functioning. A perceived failure by governments to respond to the climate crisis is associated with increased distress. There is an urgent need for further research into the emotional impact of climate change on children and young people and for governments to validate their distress by taking urgent action on climate change.","2",0,"2","Political",2,1

Brain and Neuroscience Advances, 6, 23982128221075430.","The climate crisis and ecological emergency have never been more urgent. With each day that passes, the carbon in our atmosphere goes relentlessly up, and biodiversity crashes relentlessly down. Neuroscientists, just like everybody else, contribute to these problems, from the environmental costs of what we do in the lab to how we attend conferences. But as professional scientists, we are well placed to systematically and precisely measure the footprint of our research activities and make evidence-based decisions on what needs to change in our research practices.

We call on all neuroscientists, not just those interested in sustainability, to make these changes a matter of the most urgent priority. If we do not lead from the front, how can we expect members of the public at large to support the far-reaching societal shifts that are needed to address the climate crisis? We also call on neuroscientists to become ambassadors for climate action, in their institutions and in wider society. Many of us hold the reins of power on university committees and funding panels. From campaigns to decarbonize your institution‚Äôs energy supply to campaigns for meat-free campuses, there are many ways in which a combination of top-down commitment from senior academics and bottom-up demand from students and staff can change your institution for the better. It is also critical that those of us who have benefited the most from the historical, carbon-intensive system are also those that carry the lion‚Äôs share of the burden of the transition to more sustainable practices.

Most important of all: talk about it. Discuss the sustainability implications of research practices within your lab, your department, in meetings, and at conferences. Tell your colleagues how worried you are. Speak to your political representatives. Confronting the ‚Äòinconvenient truth‚Äô of the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced is frightening. We have found that talking about the climate crisis, with each other, with colleagues ‚Äì in fact, with pretty much anyone ‚Äì helps us feel less isolated. Speaking out about the climate crisis can also create hope, in finding others who also want to act.

And there is still hope that we can avert the worst possible outcomes. But the window for action is very rapidly closing, and so ‚Äì neuroscientists ‚Äì we must act on the climate crisis and ecological emergency. Fast.","Our planet is experiencing severe and accelerating climate and ecological breakdown caused by human activity. As professional scientists, we are better placed than most to understand the data that evidence this fact. However, like most other people, we ignore this inconvenient truth and lead our daily lives, at home and at work, as if these facts weren‚Äôt true. In particular, we overlook that our own neuroscientific research practices, from our laboratory experiments to our often global travel, help drive climate change and ecosystem damage. We also hold privileged positions of authority in our societies but rarely speak out. Here, we argue that to help society create a survivable future, we neuroscientists can and must play our part. In April 2021, we delivered a symposium at the British Neuroscience Association meeting outlining what we think neuroscientists can and should do to help stop climate breakdown. Building on our talks (Box 1), we here outline what the climate and ecological emergencies mean for us as neuroscientists. We highlight the psychological mechanisms that block us from taking action, and then outline what practical steps we can take to overcome these blocks and work towards sustainability. In particular, we review environmental issues in neuroscience research, scientific computing, and conferences. We also highlight the key advocacy roles we can all play in our institutions and in society more broadly. The need for sustainable change has never been more urgent, and we call on all (neuro)scientists to act with the utmost urgency.","2",1,"1","Political",2,1

Nature Climate Change, 2(10), 732-735.","Extending research that casts doubt on the knowledge-deficit explanation for public controversy over climate-change and other environmental risks, these findings suggest that bounded rationality is an unsatisfactory explanation as well.

On the contrary, our findings could be viewed as evidence of how remarkably well-equipped ordinary individuals are to discern which stances towards scientific information secure their personal interests. We will elaborate on this interpretation, which we offer as our own best provisional understanding of the results of this and related studies, but which we also believe warrants corroboration by experimental testing. We stress, too, that as consequential as cultural cognition is for disagreement over climate change, it does not imply the irrelevance of other, more general impediments to public engagement with climate-change science, including trust in communicators and the affective attenuation of risks seen by many as remote in time and place.

For the ordinary individual, the most consequential effect of his beliefs about climate change is likely to be on his relations with his peers. A hierarchical individualist who expresses anxiety about climate change might well be shunned by his co-workers at an oil refinery in Oklahoma City. A similar fate will probably befall the egalitarian communitarian English professor who reveals to colleagues in Boston that she thinks the scientific consensus on climate change is a hoax. At the same time, neither the beliefs an ordinary person forms about scientific evidence nor any actions he takes‚Äîas a consumer, say, or democratic voter‚Äîwill by itself aggravate or mitigate the dangers of climate change. On his own, he is just not consequential enough to matter. Given how much the ordinary individual depends on peers for support‚Äîmaterial and emotional‚Äîand how little impact his beliefs have on the physical environment, he would probably be best off if he formed risk perceptions that minimized any danger of estrangement from his community.

A long-established body of work examining motivated cognition supports this conjecture. Both to avoid dissonance and to secure their group standing, individuals unconsciously seek out and credit information supportive of ‚Äúself-defining . . . values [and] attitudes,‚Äù such as the shared world-views featured in the study of cultural cognition. The predictive power of cultural world-views implies that the average member of the public performs these tasks quite proficiently.

Our data, consistent with that observed in other settings, suggest that those with the highest degree of science literacy and numeracy perform such tasks even more discerningly. Fitting information to identity-defining commitments makes demands on all manner of cognition‚Äîincluding both system 1 and system 2 reasoning. For ordinary citizens, the reward for acquiring greater scientific knowledge and more reliable technical-reasoning capacities is a greater facility to discover and use‚Äîor explain away‚Äîevidence relating to their groups‚Äô positions.

Even if cultural cognition serves the personal interests of individuals, this form of reasoning can have a highly negative impact on collective decision making. What guides individual risk perception, on this account, is not the truth of those beliefs but rather their congruence with individuals‚Äô cultural commitments. As a result, if beliefs about a societal risk such as climate change come to bear meanings congenial to some cultural outlooks but hostile to others, individuals motivated to adopt culturally congruent risk perceptions will fail to converge, or at least fail to converge as rapidly as they should, on scientific information essential to their common interests in health and prosperity. Although it is effectively costless for any individual to form a perception of climate-change risk that is wrong but culturally congenial, it is very harmful to collective welfare for individuals in aggregate to form beliefs this way.

One aim of science communication, we submit, should be to dispel this tragedy of the risk-perception commons. A communication strategy that focuses only on transmission of sound scientific information, our results suggest, is unlikely to do that. As worthwhile as it would be, simply improving the clarity of scientific information will not dispel public conflict so long as the climate-change debate continues to feature cultural meanings that divide citizens of opposing world-views.

It does not follow, however, that nothing can be done to promote constructive and informed public deliberations. As citizens understandably tend to conform their beliefs about societal risk to beliefs that predominate among their peers, communicators should endeavor to create a deliberative climate in which accepting the best available science does not threaten any group‚Äôs values. Effective strategies include use of culturally diverse communicators, whose affinity with different communities enhances their credibility, and information-framing techniques that invest policy solutions with resonances congenial to diverse groups. Perfecting such techniques through a new science of science communication is a public good of singular importance.
","Seeming public apathy over climate change is often attributed to a deficit in comprehension. The public knows too little science, it is claimed, to understand the evidence or avoid being misled1. Widespread limits on technical reasoning aggravate the problem by forcing citizens to use unreliable cognitive heuristics to assess risk2. We conducted a study to test this account and found no support for it. Members of the public with the highest degrees of science literacy and technical reasoning capacity were not the most concerned about climate change. Rather, they were the ones among whom cultural polarization was greatest. This result suggests that public divisions over climate change stem not from the public‚Äôs incomprehension of science but from a distinctive conflict of interest: between the personal interest individuals have in forming beliefs in line with those held by others with whom they share close ties and the collective one they all share in making use of the best available science to promote common welfare.","4",0,"4","Political",4,0
243,70,"Kahan, D. M. (2013). Ideology, motivated reasoning, and cognitive reflection. Judgment and Decision making, 8(4), 407-424.","5.1 Summary of resultsThe motivation (consciously, at least) for this study was to assess three dynamics understood to be relevant to political contestation over facts that turn on scientific or related forms of empirical evidence: heuristic-driven reasoning, the cognitive-style correlates of political conservativism, and motivated cognition. For that purpose, the study measured the cognitive reflection of individuals of diverse ideologies and also tested how willing they were to entertain evidence that those who disagreed with their ideological group‚Äôs position on a charged issue‚Äîclimate change‚Äîwere themselves open-minded and reflective.The study considered three conjectures about how heuristic-driven reasoning, ideological predispositions, and motivated reasoning relate to one another. The first‚Äîthe ‚ÄúBounded Rationality Position‚Äù or BRP‚Äîasserts that public conflict over risk and other policy relevant facts is a consequence of the predominance of heuristic-driven, System 1 information processing, which interferes with the public‚Äôs understanding of complicated evidence and motivates it to assess evidence consistently with cultural or ideological predispositions (e.g., Reference Marx, Weber, Orlove, Leiserowitz, Krantz, Roncoli and PhillipsMarx et al. 2007; Reference Weber and SternWeber & Stern, 2011).The study did not support BRP. On the contrary, the experimental component of the study demonstrated that the disposition to engage in conscious and effortful System 2 information processing‚Äîas measured by the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)‚Äîactually magnifies the impact of motivated reasoning.The study results were also inconsistent with the ‚ÄúIdeological Asymmetry Position‚Äù or IAP. IAP attributes public conflict over policy-relevant facts to an affinity between conservative ideology and traits such as dogmatism and aversion to complexity, which fuel the motivated rejection of evidence incompatible with conservative policy aims (Reference Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski and SullowayJost et al., 2003).The study findings pose two distinct challenges to IAP. First, the study found no meaningful correlation between right-wing ideology and CRT performance, an objective measure of reflection that has been shown to be one of the strongest predictors of conscious, effortful information processing. The CRT is routinely treated as a ‚Äústronger‚Äù performance-based alternative to (Reference Pennycook, Cheyne, Barr, Koehler and FugelsangPennycook et al. 2013) or ‚Äúbehavioral‚Äù corroborator of (Reference Iyer, Koleva, Graham, Ditto and HaidtIyer et al., 2012) Need for Cognition, Need for Closure, dogmatism, fear of complexity and like measures (Reference Stanovich, West, Toplak, Evans, Manktelow, Over and ElqayamStanovich, West & Toplak, 2011; Reference Boschetti, Richert, Walker, Price and DutraBoschetti et. al., 2012), which are the basis of the research that finds conservatives to be distinctively resistant to counter-attitudinal evidence. The CRT has been used to test and generate evidence supportive of the parallel claim that religiosity is associated with resistance to scientific and other forms of empirical evidence. It is thus puzzling that CRT did not correlate negatively with conservativism (and indeed correlated positively with self-identification with the Republican Party) in the large nationally representative sample used in this study. This result is at odds with those based on nonrepresentative samples.Second, this study used an experimental design and a statistical-testing strategy specifically fitted to evaluating the assumption that the force of ideological motivated reasoning varies in intensity across the right-left political spectrum. It found that, when assessing evidence of the other group‚Äôs propensity to consider evidence in an open-minded and reflective way, liberals and conservatives were uniformly prone to ideologically motivated reasoning. This result reinforces those observed in other studies that have reported finding that motivated reasoning is symmetric across groups of opposing political and cultural outlooks.The study also examined one other account of political polarization over risk and related policy-relevant facts: the ‚ÄúExpressive Utility Position‚Äù or EUP. The study results were largely in accord with this view.EUP alone predicted both that ideologically motivated reasoning would be symmetric and that it would be amplified by higher CRT scores. Those hypotheses reflect a theory that sees ideologically motivated cognition not as a reasoning deficiency but as a reasoning adaptation suited to promoting the interest that individuals have in conveying their membership in and loyalty to affinity groups central to their personal wellbeing. Because individuals make use of this form of information-processing to protect their stake in all manner of groups‚Äîincluding ones not connected to politics (Reference Sherman and CohenSherman & Cohen, 2006; Reference Hastorf and CantrilHastorf & Cantril, 1954)‚Äîthere is no reason to expect it to be more pronounced among people who subscribe to any particular ideology. In addition, because this dynamic reliably guides individuals to assign information the significance that advances their personal ends (albeit not their collective ones (Reference KahanKahan, 2012b)), there is good reason to expect it to be used with even greater precision and accuracy by individuals disposed to engage in conscious, effortful forms of information processing.The only discrepancy between the study results and EUP was the limited scope of the interaction between cognitive reflection and motivated reasoning. Higher CRT scores meaningfully amplified motivated reasoning in only one of the two experimental conditions that presented evidence that was expected to polarize (and did polarize) subjects of opposing political outlooks.While not hypothesized, this result is not incompatible with EUP. The charge that ‚Äúclimate-change skeptics‚Äù are ‚Äúclosed minded‚Äù and ‚Äúbiased‚Äù is likely more familiar to people than the charge that ‚Äúclimate-change believers‚Äù are. The wording of the information furnished to subjects was in fact fairly dense. If subjects low in CRT had difficulty with it or were reluctant to expend the mental effort to parse it, they would have been more likely to misunderstand it when it conveyed the less familiar claim (‚Äúbelievers are closed minded‚Äù) than when it conveyed the more familiar one (‚Äúskeptics are closed minded‚Äù). Subjects with higher CRT scores were more likely to grasp the surprising meaning conveyed by the instruction in the ‚Äúbeliever-is-biased‚Äù condition, making them more prone than low-scoring ones in that condition to form an appraisal of the test‚Äôs validity that conformed to their ideological predispositions.5.2 Implications for ongoing study of dual-process and motivated reasoningThe status of motivated reasoning within dual process reasoning theories has not been studied extensively by social psychologists. Many commentators have assumed‚Äînot implausibly‚Äîthat ideologically motivated cognition is a manifestation of unconscious, heuristic-driven reasoning processes amenable to being overridden by dispositions that promote reflection and critical engagement with counter-attitudinal evidence (e.g., Reference Lilienfeld, Ammirati and LandfieldLilienfeld et al. 2009; Reference SunsteinSunstein, 2006b; Reference Westen, Blagov, Harenski, Kilts and HamannWesten et al., 2006). The results of this study cast doubt on this claim.It should be stressed, however, that this result is not in tension with dual-process reasoning theories generally, but only with a particular surmise about how a particular cognitive dynamic should be assimilated to such theories. Indeed, in work that actually predates the adaptation of the now-familiar ‚ÄúSystem 1/System 2‚Äù framework, at least some dual-process theorists took the position that motivated reasoning should be expected to characterize higher-level, systematic forms of cognition as well, particularly when the motivated use of conscious and effortful processing could be expected to advance an agent‚Äôs ends in maintaining his or her connection to an identity-defining group (Reference Cohen, Cohen, West and AikenCohen, 2003; Reference Chen, Duckworth and ChaikenChen & Chaiken, 1999; Reference Chaiken and MaheswaranChaiken & Maheswaran, 1994; Reference Giner-Sorolla and ChaikenGiner-Sorrolla & Chaiken, 1997). The current study, by generating evidence that the disposition to engage in effortful information processing can amplify motivated reasoning, is more consistent with the latter position.Indeed, these findings informed the ‚Äúexpressive utility position‚Äù tested in the study. That same hypothesis, moreover, figured in a previous observational study, which found that cultural polarization over climate-change and nuclear-power risks are greatest among individuals who are higher in scientific literacy and in numeracy, a technical-reasoning measure of which CRT is a subcomponent (Reference Kahan, Peters, Wittlin, Slovic, Ouellette, Braman and MandelKahan, Peters et al. 2012). The experimental results of the present study help corroborate the inference that the correlations reported in that earlier study are property attributed to the power of motivated cognition to penetrate the forms of information processing associated with Kahneman‚Äôs ‚ÄúSystem 2‚Äù form of reasoning.Of course, the findings of this single study do not conclusively demonstrate that the disposition to engage in reflective rather than heuristic-information processing invariably magnifies ideologically motivated reasoning. Empirical studies, when valid, merely supply more evidence to believe or disbelieve a hypothesis, the truth of which must be assessed on the basis of all the valid evidence at hand and thereafter reassessed on the basis of any evidence generated by future valid studies (Reference PopperPopper, 1959).Specific to this particular study, there are many reasons not to consider the issue of ideologically motivated reasoning and reflective information-processing to be ‚Äúclosed‚Äù. The most important of these is continuing debate over the adequacy of existing measures of reflective information-processing and critical-thinking dispositions generally. One issue concerns the relative validity of self-reporting measures (such as ‚ÄúNeed for Cognition‚Äù and ‚ÄúNeed for Closure‚Äù), on the one hand, and objective measures such as the CRT, on the other.Another concerns the strength of CRT relative to alternative objective measures. Because CRT is such a demanding test‚Äîbecause it is not uncommon, in a general population sample, for over a third of the sample to get zero answers correct, and for less than 10% to answer all three questions correctly‚ÄîCRT is of limited value in explaining variance among a large portion of the population. Numeracy is superior to CRT in this respect, and is a stronger predictor of vulnerability to cognitive biases, likely for this reason (Reference Liberali, Reyna, Furlan, Stein and PardoLiberali et al., 2011; Reference Weller, Dieckmann, Tusler, Mertz, Burns and PetersWeller et al., 2012). But as indicated, numeracy too has been found to predict greater, not diminished, political polarization over risks like the ones associated with climate change and nuclear power (Reference Kahan, Peters, Wittlin, Slovic, Ouellette, Braman and MandelKahan, Peters et al., 2012).Exactly what both CRT and numeracy measure, however, is also contested (Reference Liberali, Reyna, Furlan, Stein and PardoLiberali et al., 2011). In particular, whether either measures critical reflection directly or instead only indirectly‚Äîas a correlate of a more general proficiency in mathematical computation or even a general form of intellectual capacity‚Äîcontinues to be debated. Some researchers have concluded that CRT is diagnostic of all manner of critical thinking (Reference Toplak, West and StanovichToplak, West & Stanovich, 2011), including the motivation to re-examine existing beliefs (Reference Campitelli and LabollitaCampitelli & Labollita, 2010; Reference Stanovich, West, Toplak, Evans, Manktelow, Over and ElqayamStanovich, West & Toplak, 2011) associated with the Actively Open-minded Thinking construct (AOT; Reference AdornoBaron, 2008) or reflection/impulsivity (Reference Baron, Badgio, Gaskins and SternbergBaron, Badgio & Gaskins, 1986). But whether CRT indeed measures willingness to revise strongly held beliefs, or does so as well as a measure specifically geared toward AOT, is not resolved. Necessarily unresolved, too, then, is whether a study of motivated reasoning that investigated its interaction with a suitable AOT scale (e.g., Haran, Ritov & Mellers, 2013) would find that the form of critical thinking that scale measures likewise magnifies ideologically motivated reasoning in the manner that CRT, numeracy, science literacy (Reference Kahan, Peters, Wittlin, Slovic, Ouellette, Braman and MandelKahan, Peters et al., 2012), and political knowledge (Reference Arceneaux and JohnsonArceneaux & Johnson, 2013; Reference Taber and LodgeTaber & Lodge, 2006) all do or instead diminishes it (Reference BaronBaron, 1995).It thus makes sense to continue intensive study of the relationship between ideological polarization and information processing using a variety of measures, a strategy that recognizes the role that convergent validity always plays in insuring against the necessary imperfection of any single measure or method in the social sciences. Indeed, if a variety of measures and methods do converge on the conclusion that ideologically motivated reasoning is impervious to the habits of mind most strongly associated with valid, evidence-based inference, such a program of study is the one most likely to broaden insight into how the conditions that generate an influence this inimical to reason might be counteracted (Reference Fernbach, Rogers, Fox and SlomanFernbach, Rogers, Fox & Sloman, 2013; Reference Lavine, Johnston and SteenbergenLavine, Johnston & Steenbergen, 2012).5.3 Implications for counteracting ideologically motivated reasoningThe goal of empirically investigating the sources of political conflict over risk and other policy-consequential facts is not merely to explain this phenomenon but also to aid in discovery of devices for mitigating it. The study described in this paper makes a contribution to that end as well.It does this primarily by helping to inform hypotheses about how such dynamics might be combated. Many scholars have suggested ‚Äúdebiasing‚Äù strategies aimed at correcting the distorting effect of System 1 reasoning on public perceptions of risk (Reference Lilienfeld, Ammirati and LandfieldLilienfeld et al., 2009; Reference Jolls and SunsteinJolls & Sunstein, 2006). Because such distortions are real‚Äîand substantially interfere with human wellbeing in myriad domains‚Äîpursuit of System 1 debiasing techniques is unquestionably important. Nevertheless, if, as the present study implies, ideologically motivated cognition is not a consequence of an over-reliance on heuristic reasoning, then System 1 debiasing strategies should not be expected to abate polarization over climate change, nuclear power, gun control, the HPV vaccine or like issues (Reference Kahan, Slovic, Braman and GastilKahan, Slovic, Braman & Gastil, 2006).

What is needed instead are interventions that remove the expressive incentives individuals face to form perceptions of risk and related facts on grounds unconnected to the truth of such beliefs (Reference LessigLessig, 1995). Extending the analysis of previous papers, this one has suggested that ideologically motivated reasoning is in fact expressively rational at the individual level, because it conveys individuals‚Äô membership in and loyalty to groups on whom they depend for various forms of support, emotional, material, and otherwise (Reference HillmanHillman, 2010; Reference Akerlof and KrantonAkerlof & Kranton, 2000).This account, however, presupposes that beliefs on risks and related facts bear social meanings‚Äîthat they are, in fact, generally understood (tacitly, at least) to convey that the individuals who espouse them are committed to one group rather than another (Reference Cohen, Cohen, West and AikenCohen, 2003). Not all risks and policy-relevant facts have this quality; indeed, relatively few do, and on the vast run of ones that do not (e.g., that pasteurization removes infectious agents from milk; that fluoridation of water fights tooth decay; that privatization of the air-traffic control system is inimical to air safety), we do not observe significant degrees of ideological or cultural polarization.

There is little reason to believe, moreover, that the meanings of highly contested facts are insusceptible of revision in a manner that would disconnect particular positions on them from membership in identity-defining groups. One can understand the historical shift in public opinion toward the risks posed by cigarettes (including third-party ones from passive smoke exposure or from the societal expenditures necessary to treat individuals with lung cancer) as having been mediated by informational campaigns aimed at altering the positive meanings that dismissing evidence of the health hazards of smoking expressed in certain subcommunities (United States Public Health Service, 2000; Reference Gusfield, Rabin and SugarmanGusfield 1993).The expressive account of ideological polarization, then, underscores the value of forming and testing hypotheses about how to regulate the social meaning of risks and related policy-relevant facts. Indeed, research focusing on forecasting techniques for identifying technologies vulnerable to polarizing meanings, on governmental processes for protecting the ‚Äúscience communication environment‚Äù from influences that cause such meanings to take hold, and on framing and other strategies for cleaning up that environment once it has been contaminated with polarizing meanings (Reference KahanKahan, 2012b), is already well underway (Reference Corner, Whitmarsh and XeniasCorner, Whitmarsh & Xenias, 2012; Reference Druckman, Bolsen and DanaDruckman & Bolsen, 2012, 2011, Reference Nisbet and ScheufeleNisbet & Scheufele, 2009).5.4 Conclusion: The tragedy of the science communications commons
What might be characterized as the ‚Äúexpressive rationality‚Äù of ideologically motivated reasoning (Reference Kahan, Peters, Wittlin, Slovic, Ouellette, Braman and MandelKahan, Peters et al., 2012) is intrinsic to a collective action problem (Reference LessigLessig, 1995). When societal risks become suffused with antagonistic social meanings, it is (often if not always, and with respect to many if not all issues) individually rational for ordinary members of the public to attend to information in a manner that reliably connects them to the positions that predominate in their identity-defining groups. Nevertheless, if ideologically diverse individuals all follow this strategy simultaneously, they will be collectively worse off, since under these conditions, democratic institutions are less likely to converge, or to converge as rapidly as they otherwise would, on policies that reflect the best available evidence on how to protect everyone from harm. But because what any ordinary individual believes about policy will not make a difference, the collective irrationality of ideologically motivated reasoning does not by itself create any reliable pressure or mechanism to induce individuals to process information in a different, and morally and politically superior, way.

Overcoming ideological polarization over societal risks and related facts thus demands collective action specifically geared at dissolving this ‚Äútragedy of the science communications commons‚Äù (following Reference HardinHardin, 1968). Supplying the knowledge needed to guide such action is a contribution that decision science is uniquely poised to make.","Decision scientists have identified various plausible sources of ideological polarization over climate change, gun violence, national security, and like issues that turn on empirical evidence. This paper describes a study of three of them: the predominance of heuristic-driven information processing by members of the public; ideologically motivated reasoning; and the cognitive-style correlates of political conservativism. The study generated both observational and experimental data inconsistent with the hypothesis that political conservatism is distinctively associated with either unreflective thinking or motivated reasoning. Conservatives did no better or worse than liberals on the Cognitive Reflection Test (Frederick, 2005), an objective measure of information-processing dispositions associated with cognitive biases. In addition, the study found that ideologically motivated reasoning is not a consequence of over-reliance on heuristic or intuitive forms of reasoning generally. On the contrary, subjects who scored highest in cognitive reflection were the most likely to display ideologically motivated cognition. These findings corroborated an alternative hypothesis, which identifies ideologically motivated cognition as a form of information processing that promotes individuals‚Äô interests in forming and maintaining beliefs that signify their loyalty to important affinity groups. The paper discusses the practical significance of these findings, including the need to develop science communication strategies that shield policy-relevant facts from the influences that turn them into divisive symbols of political identity.","4",0,"4","Political",4,1

Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 11(1), 102-109.","The pervasive nature of memory biases extends far beyond the personal realm, exerting a significant influence on various facets of public policy. These biases, inherent in the way individuals and groups remember and interpret information, have the potential to shape decisions and behaviors across a broad spectrum of societal issues (Madan, 2024).
The ramifications of the primacy effect are particularly salient in the judicial system, where first impressions can skew the impartiality of a jury or influence the decision-making of judges (Lawson, 1968; Stone, 1969; Weld & Roff, 1938). Similarly, in the corporate world, hiring practices often hinge on initial interviews (Barrick et al., 2010; Carlson, 1971; London & Hakel, 1974; Shaheen, 2010; Swider et al., 2016), potentially overshadowing subsequent evidence of a candidate's capabilities or fit. Consider the significant role of primacy in long-term relationships and career trajectories. The initial period of a relationship or the first few days on a job can disproportionately influence enduring perception of others and commitment to future endeavors. This accentuates the necessity for awareness and potential corrective measures in scenarios where first impressions may lead to long-standing biases.The influence of memory salience on decision-making holds significant policy implications, particularly in domains where risk and uncertainty are prevalent, such as gambling. When individuals make decisions about risk, the most accessible memories can disproportionately sway their judgment. For instance, the vivid recollection of a past win at a casino can overshadow the numerous losses, leading to an inflated sense of the likelihood of winning again. This bias can fuel problematic gambling behaviors, as the salience of winning memories may drive repeated betting despite unfavorable odds (Gilovich & Douglas, 1986). Policy interventions might include mandatory breaks in play to allow for reflection, or the implementation of tools that track gambling behavior and provide feedback to the gambler, helping to bridge the gap between memory salience and realistic risk assessment (Auer & Griffiths, 2017; Braverman et al., 2014; Wohl et al., 2017). Information salience can also be increased in accessibility‚Äîfor instance, during elections, people vote in variety of polling locations. Some locations for voting occurred in churches, schools, or community centers‚Äîballots on policies and funding priorities can be biased by polling location (Berger et al., 2008; Pryor et al., 2014).Remembering the source of information is necessary in our information-rich modern world. In our daily consumption of information, particularly news, we are frequently faced with narratives of events that we have not witnessed first-hand. The evaluation of such information necessitates a discerning consideration of its origin‚Äîthe source‚Äîas well as a reflection on our pre-existing perceptions of the source's credibility and reliability. Distinguishing between a report from a reputable national newspaper and a sensational headline from a tabloid becomes a crucial exercise in critical thinking. This differentiation is not merely academic; it has tangible implications for how we construct our understanding of the world and the trust we place in the information that shapes our realities. If we later find out that some information were untrue, we need to incorporate this into our memory such that we do not mix facts with fiction, lest we confuse information and misinformation (Blank et al., 2022; Echterhoff et al., 2005, 2007; Frost et al., 2002; Putnam et al., 2017; Wahlheim et al., 2019). The ability to update our memory to segregate fact from fiction is not just a cognitive necessity but a societal imperative. Policies that aim to counteract misinformation must therefore account for these memory biases and develop strategies to reinforce factual information. Such strategies might include repeated communication of verified facts, highlighting the differences between information and misinformation, and the promotion of critical thinking skills to evaluate the validity of information (Bailey et al., 2021; de Saint Laurent et al., 2022; Freeze et al., 2021; Negley et al., 2018; Yang, 2020).The music people listen to during formative years become a part of identity. Canada requires a certain quota of broadcasted music is Canadian. This policy not only supports Canadian artists but also instills a sense of national identity through music (Muia, 2020). As individuals grow up listening to a certain proportion of Canadian music, these songs and artists become interlaced with personal and cultural milestones, contributing to a shared national identity. The music that plays during one's formative years‚Äîthe reminiscence bump‚Äîleaves a lasting imprint, and by ensuring Canadian tunes are part of this mix, the policy shapes both individual and collective memory. In April 2023, the Canadian parliament passed Bill C-11, seeking to extend this curated cultural experience to now apply to online streaming. The legislation's implications are profound; it aims to preserve the presence of Canadian music in an increasingly borderless digital world, thereby continuing to influence music preferences and reinforce a sense of Canadian identity. This strategic move underlines the government's recognition of music as a powerful medium for identity formation, ensuring that Canadian voices remain central to the soundtrack of Canadians‚Äô lives, even as the modes of listening change. This approach to content regulation underscores the recognition of media's role in identity formation‚Äînot only through the music that resonates with the hearts of its people but also through the stories and information that stimulate their minds.EFT, the ability to project oneself into the future to pre-experience an event, has profound implications for shaping long-term planning. In financial decision-making, interventions based on EFT could involve exercises that encourage individuals to visualize their future selves enjoying the benefits of saving or suffering the consequences of excessive spending. Financial advisors and savings programs might use virtual reality or narrative storytelling as tools to make future financial states more tangible and immediate (e.g., Robalino et al., 2023). Public health campaigns could employ EFT to motivate healthier eating. For instance, programs could guide individuals through a detailed envisioning of future health outcomes based on current eating practices, making the abstract concept of health more concrete and immediate. This could be facilitated through apps that illustrate potential future physical changes or through health education that ties current choices to specific future well-being scenarios. Policy interventions could leverage EFT to encourage sustainable lifestyle practices through community-based projects that simulate future local environments affected by climate change or interactive platforms that allow people to see the potential results of collective environmental efforts. Such EFT-based interventions aim to bridge the gap between present actions and future consequences, making the latter more psychologically present and impactful. By employing EFT strategies, policies and programs can help individuals to align their current behaviors with future-oriented goals, leading to more thoughtful and sustainable decision-making.Summary
Highlighted here are memory phenomena interacting with public policy, demonstrating how understanding memory extends beyond individual experiences to shape societal norms and decision-making (also see Madan, 2024). Through an examination of five key memory phenomena, this analysis has shown the crucial role of memory processes in forming various aspects of policy. The integration of memory research into policy considerations offers a pathway to more informed and effective decision-making. For example, the primacy effect in judicial decisions and hiring practices shows the substantive impact of memory biases on important societal choices. Similarly, the relevance of EFT in financial planning and environmental behavior highlights the broad influence of memory in guiding real-world change.
Memory is important in everyday life, yet its central role in forming self and identity is often overlooked. Memory biases, manifesting in numerous ways, play a key role in how people interact with the world. These biases are evident in situations ranging from the music heard in our formative years to the benefits of EFT. The formation of beliefs and preferences is closely tied to these memory biases. As we gather experiences, we develop decision-making heuristics that guide our choices in various situations (Madan et al., 2021; Mason et al., 2022; Weber & Johnson, 2006). These heuristics are shaped not only by direct memories of past events but also by experiences that influence our beliefs and behaviors, even if we are not consciously able to recollect them (Addis & Tippett, 2004; Guzm√°n-V√©lez et al., 2014; Kunst-Wilson & Zajonc, 1980; Madan, 2020, 2023; Palombo et al., 2021).In conclusion‚Äîthe relationships among memory, belief, and identity go beyond academic discussions, underlying a fundamental facet of shaping societal structures and policies. Efforts need to be considered for advocating the relevance of memory research when developing policy.","Memory profoundly define individual beliefs and identity, shaping how societies make decisions. Five key memory phenomena include‚Äîfirst impressions and the primacy effect, risky decision-making and memory availability, information reliability and source memory, music preferences and the reminiscence bump, and long-term planning and episodic future thinking. Each phenomenon is explored for its impact on policy, revealing the profound ways that memory biases and processes shape critical societal choices, such as judicial decisions, hiring practices, financial planning, and pro-environmental behavior. Although memory's importance in daily life is widely recognized, its central role in shaping self-identity and influencing societal structures is often underestimated. Memory biases, evident in various aspects, from cultural exposures to decision-making heuristics, play a pivotal role in individual and collective behavior. These biases, often manifesting subtly, guide the formation of beliefs and preferences, with strong implications for policy making. Taken together, this work advocates for a multidisciplinary approach to bridge memory theory and policy practice.","Apolitical",1,"4","Political",4,1

With each day that passes, the carbon in our atmosphere goes relentlessly up, and biodiversity crashes relentlessly down. Neuroscientists, just like everybody else, contribute to these problems, from the environmental costs of what we do in the lab to how we attend conferences. But as professional scientists, we are well placed to systematically and precisely measure the footprint of our research activities and make evidence-based decisions on what needs to change in our research practices.

We call on all neuroscientists, not just those interested in sustainability, to make these changes a matter of the most urgent priority. If we do not lead from the front, how can we expect members of the public at large to support the far-reaching societal shifts that are needed to address the climate crisis? We also call on neuroscientists to become ambassadors for climate action, in their institutions and in wider society. Many of us hold the reins of power on university committees and funding panels. From campaigns to decarbonize your institution‚Äôs energy supply to campaigns for meat-free campuses, there are many ways in which a combination of top-down commitment from senior academics and bottom-up demand from students and staff can change your institution for the better. It is also critical that those of us who have benefited the most from the historical, carbon-intensive system are also those that carry the lion‚Äôs share of the burden of the transition to more sustainable practices.

Most important of all: talk about it. Discuss the sustainability implications of research practices within your lab, your department, in meetings, and at conferences. Tell your colleagues how worried you are. Speak to your political representatives. Confronting the ‚Äòinconvenient truth‚Äô of the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced is frightening. We have found that talking about the climate crisis, with each other, with colleagues ‚Äì in fact, with pretty much anyone ‚Äì helps us feel less isolated. Speaking out about the climate crisis can also create hope, in finding others who also want to act.

And there is still hope that we can avert the worst possible outcomes. But the window for action is very rapidly closing, and so ‚Äì neuroscientists ‚Äì we must act on the climate crisis and ecological emergency. Fast.
","Constraints on the use of benefit-cost tests have generated increased interest in risk-risk analysis as a regulatory test. The effect on individual mortality of the income losses arising from regulatory expenditures can be determined from direct empirical estimates, which this article surveys. The article proposes an alternative formulation based on information on the value of life and the marginal propensity to spend on health, which implies a loss of one statistical life for every $50 million in expenditures.

Therefore I feel that it is extremely important to point out the socially constructed nature of genetic determinist views and deconstruct them in order to undermine their harmful social influence. The debates and different interpretations that exist in the scientific literature on the role of genes emphasize the significant influence of social factors on this discourse. Modernity, the legitimation of social hierarchies, neoliberalism and business interests seem to be the main social-cultural, ideological and economic motivators of genetic determinism.","Recently genetic determinist claims have reappeared in the explanation of human psychology and to some extent they even made their way into explanations of social phenomena. In this article, I will provide a critical analysis of the genetic determinist discourse from a social constructionist perspective. First, I will examine the meaning of genetic determinism. Then I will shortly introduce the social constructionist perspective generally and it's relevance for analyzing scientific discourses. Next, I will examine the debates about genetic determinism in behavior genetics and sociogenomics and interpret these critically from a social constructionist and deconstructionist perspective. Finally, I will provide an analysis of the main social, ideological, cultural and economic factors that influence the development of genetic determinist ideas: modernity, the legitimation of social hierarchies, neoliberalism and business interests.

Labor market experience, work organization, gender inequalities and health status: results from a prospective analysis of US employed women. Social science & medicine, 58(3), 585-594. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0277-9536(03)00230-2","We sought to contribute to the growing literature on women's labor market characteristics and health outcomes. Our study had several strengths including the use of psychiatric interviews to obtain clinical-style diagnoses of baseline and follow-up mental health outcomes such as anxiety and depressive syndrome. We had data on mental health for two points in time, approximately 13 years apart, for our sample of women allowing us to account for mental health status that preceded the employment exposures. We had data to simultaneously examine several indicators of labor market risk factors (i.e., compensation, employer size, occupational hierarchy, promotion, demotion). And finally, we were able to use these data to create indicators for examining the extent of pay, power and work organization gender inequality by categories of occupation.
Despite some observed associations with work-related characteristics, some of the hypothesized relationships were not confirmed. Significantly, we found no associations with several of the individually based work organization variables‚Äîjob strain, passive jobs‚Äîand health outcomes. This deviates from some previous research in this area (Hibbard & Pope, 1987; Griffin et al., 2000). A previous study using the same Baltimore ECA follow-up data reported significant associations with high job strain and major depressive disorder but, like our analyses, not depressive syndrome among women (Mausner-Dorsch & Eaton, 2000). Mausner-Dorsch and Eaton's analysis differed from ours in that they used a modified version of Karasek's demand control scale based upon results of factor analyses and did not account for earlier depressive syndrome as we did in this analysis. Our analysis showed no associations with individual reports of job strain and distress, depressive syndrome, anxiety or fair/poor health. Differences between our analysis and previous studies include the younger age distribution of other studies (Hibbard & Pope, 1987), cross sectional analyses of other samples (Hibbard & Pope, 1987; Mausner-Dorsch & Eaton, 2000), and use of non-clinically based assessments for mental disorders (Griffin et al., 2000), making direct comparisons of these studies to ours difficult.
In addition, the lack of associations for the workplace factors may be explained by the demographic characteristics of or information available in our study sample. First, this is a middle- and older-aged population of women with the average age being in the mid-50s. Relatively few women in this sample had young children in the home. The proportion who had elders in the home may have been too small to be able to measure the impact of this care-giving responsibility on health outcomes. Since this is an older sample, a sizable proportion of women are close to or beyond the age for retirement. However, the employment-related factors of interest to us, especially the gender inequality factors, may be more salient for younger women who are climbing their career ladders or who have not yet peaked in their careers. Moreover, given that the women in our sample have been in the workplace for so long, they may represent a resilient worker population with regard to being impacted by factors in the workplace such as job strain. It is also possible that given the 13 years span used to construct our workplace exposure information, that varying time intervals between exposure and outcomes for the individuals in our study contributed to the inability to detect associations (e.g., for passive jobs, some persons may have been involved in such jobs for years while others may be have only recently entered into a job that is considered passive yet both are considered a ‚Äúyes‚Äù on the ‚Äúpassive jobs‚Äù variable). If some or all of these factors are operating in this set of analyses, we might expect to see fewer associations with workplace factors and health outcomes for our sample than for a younger sample of women or for a sample with a shorter follow-up period.
Several new associations with work variables and health outcomes for women were observed our study. One of the most consistent associations observed for the mental health outcomes was that for financial strain. Consistent with previous work on poverty and unemployment, those with financial strain reported higher odds of distress, depressive syndrome and anxiety. Having received a promotion within the 13 years prior to the survey was protective for high levels of overall distress (GHQ). Having received a demotion within the 13 years prior to the survey was associated with high levels of overall distress. Our apriori assumption about firm size was that larger firms may have formal policies that support women's needs to provide for self and care-taking responsibilities (e.g., going to the doctor for self or child) and that promote health. Large firm size was protective for general distress (GHQ) and anxiety but not the other two outcomes. Being a professional was only protective for fair or poor health.
Our findings share similarities and differences from some studies on women's employment and health. First, we found that marital status was not consistently associated with all of our health outcomes. Married women were less likely to report depressive syndrome or fair or poor health in our study but not anxiety disorder or distress. Previous studies of women's employment and health, or women's multiple roles and health have found that being married is associated with better health (Arber, 1991; Weatherall et al., 1994; Macran et al., 1996; Khlat et al., 2000; Lahelma et al., 2000). We also found few associations with care-giving roles‚Äîthat is children in the home, elderly relatives in the home‚Äîand health outcomes while some previous literature has documented associations with adverse mental health and presence of young children in the home (e.g., McLanahan & Adams, 1987) but not all (e.g., Arber 1991; Macran et al., 1996; Dautzenberg et al., 1999; Griffin et al., 2000). The individually based measures of policy making or occupationally based class measures (Wright, 1997) were not associated with any of the outcomes we examined among the women in our sample. This warrants further investigation in other samples, especially samples of women in earlier stages of their careers. Moreover, given the complexity of our data‚Äîthe exposure data spanning 13 years and the numerous workplace and individual factors‚Äîuse of statistical analyses such as survival analysis might have yielded different results. These types of statistical methods might be employed in future investigations of these and other rich data.
This is the first study, to our knowledge, to describe gender inequality in terms of pay, power, and job stress within occupational categories for the purpose of examining associations with women's health status. We demonstrated substantial inequality between men and women within occupational categories in the area of pay, positions of power, supervisory responsibilities, jobs with high strain and jobs that are passive. In general, women are more likely to have passive jobs, to receive lower pay, to occupy jobs with fewer policy-making responsibilities, and occupy jobs with fewer supervisory responsibilities. Our findings are consistent with previous empirical reports in the literature on differences in men's and women's situations in the workplace (Messing et al., 1994; Reskin & Padavic, 1994; Johnson & Hall, 1995; England et al., 1996; Messing, 1998). Notably, in our sample, women had a lower status in the workplace despite a somewhat equitable distribution of educational attainment among women and men within occupational categories. These work inequality variables are generalizable to the extent that we can say that the sample is representative of men and women residing an urban environment. The Baltimore ECA is somewhat over representative of smaller businesses (e.g., small family businesses) where gender segregation may be different from that observed in larger organizations. But given that a random sampling process was employed, the men and women in the sample should be equally representative of their stated occupations; thus, the differences between men and women as reflected in the inequality indicators should be similar to what we might see in other samples of employed urban populations. The Baltimore ECA follow-up study had extensive information on employment characteristics that could be used to create this varied set of inequality indicators. Future studies should attempt to measure gender inequalities among larger samples of workers to enable the creation of inequality indicators for more refined categories of occupation.
We found that one indicator of gender inequality, Low F/M strain was associated with two of our outcomes of health and well-being. Surprisingly, women in jobs where there were low F/M strain ratios had higher levels of anxiety and fair or poor health. We would have predicted that jobs with low F/M strain would lead to better, not worse, health outcomes. This finding, in part, may be a function of the distribution of that variable. Two of the occupational categories with low ratios of F/M strain‚Äîmachine operator and transportation‚Äîhad values of zero indicating that no women reported ‚Äúhigh job strain‚Äù (high levels of job demands and low levels of job control) in those occupations. These are traditionally male occupations and women in those occupations may have more passive jobs (low levels of demands and low levels of control) as supported by our data on the ratio of F/M passive jobs. The Machine operator and Transportation occupations were among those occupations with the highest levels of F/M passive jobs. Future studies with larger samples enabling an examination of gender inequality using more refined occupational measures may facilitate a greater understanding of this finding.
Taken together, our findings suggest that measuring the complexities of employment including promotion or demotion history and firm size can yield important information about associations with health and well-being beyond what is typically measured in work-related studies. Moreover, examining gender inequality within occupations adds another important dimension to being able to identify determinants of health and well-being. Indicators of gender inequality should be examined in future studies of employed populations to gain a greater understanding of how structural factors contribute to the health and well-being of employed persons.","Women's labor force participation has increased dramatically over the past several decades. Although previous research has documented that a wide array of labor market characteristics affect health, more work is needed to understand how women are impacted by gender-specific employment patterns and exposures. We examine a cohort of 659 employed women from the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) study in the USA. Baseline and follow-up data collected 13 years apart are used to identify associations between demographic, labor market, work organization, and occupational gender inequality with four health outcomes: generalized distress, depressive syndrome, anxiety and fair or poor health. We also use gender-specific data on the workplace to create indicators of occupational gender inequality.
We found wide gender inequalities in terms of pay and power in this sample of employed women. Financial strain was associated with all of our mental health outcomes with those reporting financial strain having increased odds of distress, depressive syndrome and anxiety for the 13 years prior to the interview. Workplace factors that were found to be associated with the four outcomes included experiencing a promotion or demotion in the 13 years prior to the interview; working at a large firm; and being a professional. Occupations where women compared to men had lower levels of job strain‚Äîdomestic workers in private households, machine operator and transportation‚Äîshowed increased risk for anxiety or fair/poor health.
Our findings suggest that measuring the complexities of employment including promotion or demotion history, firm characteristics and even occupational gender inequality can yield important information about associations with health among women.","2",0,"2","Political",3,0

Political Psychology, 39(5), 1049-1067. https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.12470  ","Taken as a whole, these results suggest that left-wing authoritarianism may prove to be a viable construct in ordinary U.S. samples. Not only did LWA show a significant correlation with liberalism in both a sample of U.S. college students and a separate nationwide sample of U.S. citizens, it also showed overwhelmingly significant correlations with dogmatism, prejudice, and attitude strength. In each case, these relationships paralleled similar relationships between RWA and those constructs‚Äîand the overall average effect sizes in both studies were very similar for LWA and RWA. Further, the present results demonstrate that the presence of LWA cannot be attributed to a correlational sleight of hand: Analyses of mean patterns in both studies for liberals and conservatives clearly indicate as much (and indeed, slightly more) LWA on the left than RWA on the right. In short, these results suggest that LWA may in fact be alive and well in ordinary U.S. samples.Interpretational ObstaclesNot all of the evidence presented in the present article is favorable to this interpretation, and there are multiple limitations that need to be considered. Below, we discuss these interpretational obstacles.Content preferences versus true authoritarianism. It might be easy to dismiss these effects as reflecting the content preferences of liberals and conservatives (and thus as not reflecting anything about authoritarianism per se). There are two reasons why we think such a dismissal would be misleading.First, the dismissal is a double-edged sword. If the question is ‚Äúdo prior results suggest that conservatives are more prone to authoritarianism than liberals?‚Äù then simply dismissing our results as only having to do with content only raises the possibility that all prior results with RWA are picking up on content primarily (and not authoritarianism per se). We must apply the same standard on both sides of any debate (see, e.g., Tetlock, 1994). In this case, if the RWA scale can be reasonably used to infer the presence of authoritarianism in conservatives, then it is also safe to assume that the LWA scale (which uses identical parallel wording in each case) can be reasonably used to infer the presence of authoritarianism in liberals. And if LWA cannot be reasonably used for that purpose, then we need to be more cautious in using RWA to infer the presence of authoritarianism in conservatives.Second, equally as important, a quick dismissal of these findings reflects a failure to recognize the subjective nature of the items themselves. For example, consider that on the LWA scale, liberals agree that: Our country needs a mighty and liberal leader, 13 that the leader should destroy the radical traditional ways, that people should trust the judgment of the proper authorities, should avoid listening to noisy rabble rousers in our society who are trying to create doubts in people‚Äôs minds, should put some tough leaders in power who oppose those values and silence the troublemakers, should smash the traditional beliefs, that what our country really needs is a strong, determined leader who will crush the evil, that society should strongly punish those who try to uphold what they claim are God‚Äôs laws, deny that a Christian‚Äôs place should be wherever he or she wants to be, and support the statement that this country would work a lot better if certain groups of Christian troublemakers would just shut up and accept their group‚Äôs proper place in society.These are not merely statements of liberal ideology; they are definitive and absolute statements that unequivocally support the necessity of an extremely strong authority to guide them, rule society with an iron hand, and viciously punish societal offenders. They are statements opposing those who doubt and disavowing the equality of all people. In other words, these results suggest that U.S. liberals, too, can be overwhelmingly authoritarian.Differences between target domains. For our prejudice, dogmatism, and attitude-strength measurements, the operations differed in their target group/domain by LWA or RWA condition. This leaves open the possibility that general differences in the target domains might influence LWA and RWA effect sizes in different ways (thus altering the correlations in ways not relevant to the fundamental relationships between RWA/LWA and each construct).Clearly, it is likely that factors relevant to the content domains themselves will influence the nature of each relationship and‚Äîwhile we controlled for one such factor in Study 2‚Äîwe did not control for all possibilities here. However, four things are worth noting in this regard. First, in each case, we were careful to keep identical wording in all respects except for the target domain. Thus, it is hard to argue that participants who got (say) a dogmatism questionnaire in the LWA condition got something conceptually different than the dogmatism questionnaire in the RWA condition.Second, this issue is a necessary obstacle for this kind of research, but it does not directly undermine its value. Because the symmetry hypothesis predicts that LWA and RWA will have different domains as targets for authoritarianism, this necessitates that tests involve targets that could potentially differ in multiple other ways. Thus, the present results should not be taken as a perfect representation of the overall effect size for each conceptual area, but rather a sampling of possible domains within that area. Combined with the natural error inherent in any study, this means that we cannot make strong claims about the true effect sizes for either RWA or LWA in each domain.However, to dismiss these results on that account would be premature. No research is fully comprehensive, but we believe the present research is a meaningful starting point as evidence for the symmetry hypothesis. In addition to the fact that we have minimized systematic variance by using nearly identical wording across conditions, it is worth noting that, while there may be a tendency to assume that error or systematic variance would overestimate the size of LWA effects compared to RWA, there is no reason it must be so. It is possible that some of the differences across conditions would lead to LWA‚Äôs effect sizes being underestimated relative to RWA. As a result, while we acknowledge that the effects here may be unique to the specific domains measured‚Äîand indeed, to some degree it must be so‚Äîthese domains are nonetheless a useful starting point.Third, in making the case for the rigidity of the right, researchers have rarely made an effort to test parallel LWA effects of any kind (much less the kind rigorously used here). We must apply the same standard to both sides; as such, even excluding the RWA conditions from our studies entirely, this evidence would still be meaningful evidence of LWA. While this evidence would not argue as convincingly for the authoritarianism symmetry hypothesis without the RWA conditions, it would certainly still make a compelling argument for the consideration of LWA in ordinary samples (fully symmetrical or not)‚Äîevidence that, to this point, has been lacking.Fourth, it is also worth noting that one of the questionnaires‚Äîthe political ideology measure‚Äîwas identical across conditions, and this questionnaire showed essentially identical effect sizes overall (LWA somewhat larger in Study 1, RWA somewhat larger in Study 2, neither difference statistically significant).Concluding ThoughtsThe present results suggest that the search for LWA might not be quite like the search for the Loch Ness Monster after all. By providing researchers with a validated LWA questionnaire moving forward, it offers multiple avenues for future testing of the similarities‚Äîand potential differences‚Äî between LWA and RWA across a wide array of attitudes and behaviors.","Although past research suggests authoritarianism may be a uniquely right-wing phenomenon, the present two studies tested the hypothesis that authoritarianism exists in both right-wing and left-wing contexts in essentially equal degrees. Across two studies, university (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ475) and Mechanical Turk (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ298) participants completed either the RWA (right-wing authoritarianism) scale or a newly developed (and parallel) LWA (left-wing authoritarianism) scale. Participants further completed measurements of ideology and three domain-specific scales: prejudice, dogmatism, and attitude strength. Findings from both studies lend support to an authoritarianism symmetry hypothesis: Significant positive correlations emerged between LWA and measurements of liberalism, prejudice, dogmatism, and attitude strength. These results largely paralleled those correlating RWA with identical conservative-focused measurements, and an overall effect-size measurement showed LWA was similarly related to those constructs (compared to RWA) in both Study 1 and Study 2. Taken together, these studies provide evidence that LWA may be a viable construct in ordinary U.S. samples.","6",0,"6","Political",4,1

Mankind Quarterly, 64(2). https://doi.org/10.46469/mq.2023.64.2.11","The present study had many findings of note. First, racial gaps on scholastic tests and in SES were related to many other variables. However, the associations were not as expected by the systemic racism model. One would expect that when more people in a given polity (in this case, a county) have hostile or less favorable attitudes to Blacks and Hispanics, gaps in scholastic test scores (cognitive ability) and socioeconomic status would be larger. However, we found that these gaps are actually larger in counties with fewer Republican voters, and with a lower White population share. This is unexpected because of the well-studied associations between left-wing attitudes and pro-non-European attitudes (‚Äòantiracist‚Äô in the terminology of systemic racism writers). These unexpected associations did not disappear entirely when we statistically adjusted for potential confounders such as population density, urbanicity, and state fixed effects. The clear failure of these predictions thus throws considerable doubt on the systemic racism model.Second, we found that race gaps were consistent across variables, i.e., that counties with larger test score gaps also had larger SES gaps. This is a prediction from the competing meritocratic theory. In this model, SES outcomes such as income, educational attainment and crime are substantially caused by differences in intelligence at the individual level, and group-level differences are merely the sum of individual differences. In support of this, when we combined datasets of average test scores and SES, there was a very strong relationship between them, which was also true when we combined data across races in a single model. Our findings of test score x SES gaps replicate findings in a prior study of US states with disaggregated cognitive ability and SES by race (Kirkegaard & Fuerst, 2016). The overall finding of very strong correlations between subnational polity cognitive ability and social status was also previously found to hold across the 35 or so independent states of the Americas (Fuerst & Kirkegaard, 2016), as well as for subnational units of Argentina (Kirkegaard & Fuerst, 2017).The negative associations of White and Republican fractions of the population with race gaps are difficult to explain. We suggest this reflects largely self-selection patterns in settlement. Historically, Blacks were mostly located in the South where they were freed from slavery following the conclusion of the US Civil War in 1865. Later, large numbers of Blacks migrated north and settled in northern states and cities such as Detroit (Tolnay, 2003), where they occupied mainly low-cost housing in urban settings. These Blacks have in general been found to be positively selected for human capital traits. Tolnay (2003) writes: The PUMS [census] files have proven to be most useful for studying the educational selection of migrants from the South because the education level of an individual changes relatively little after a certain age. That evidence shows that early black southern migrants (in 1910 and 1920) were significantly more likely to be literate than blacks who remained in the South. In later years (from 1940 to 1970) the migrants had significantly higher levels of educational attainment (years of schooling) than the sedentary southern black population (Tolnay 1998a; see also, Hamilton 1959, Lieberson 1978b). In contrast, the migrants were less likely to be literate, or had lower levels of educational attainment, than the black population that they joined in the North (Tolnay 1998a).A different way to see this is that Blacks in more northern states are relatively higher in European ancestry than those in southern states (Bryc et al., 2015). Thus, insofar as European ancestry (admixture) is also associated with higher cognitive ability and social status, the northern Blacks are expected to be higher in these traits (Kirkegaard et al., 2019; Lasker et al., 2019). Still, this kind of self-selection does not explain why the results persist even when we control for the fixed effects of states as well as a host of other factors. One would have to posit additional self-selection in migration out of the cities into the rural counties that were previously near-exclusively populated by Whites. Today, Blacks vote about 90 % Democrat (87 % vs. 12 % in the 2020 presidential election when Trump did particularly well with non-White voters in his second run; BBC, 2020). This pattern then tends to result in inner cities‚Äô vote shares being largely in favor of the Democrats (r = -.66 for population density and Republican %, Table 2), which is also the case in general even without the presence of Blacks, because city dwellers tend to be more left-wing regardless of race.However, some Blacks who ‚Äòescape the ghetto‚Äô by way of attaining well-paid jobs leave and settle in more affluent, more White, and more Republican areas away from the city centers, and away from the traditional areas of Black living (e.g. Dakotas). These relatively upper-class Blacks then have children who are also above average in intelligence, and who consequently perform relatively well on school tests. Thus, the result of this account is that suburban and rural areas will tend to have a small, but relatively elite Black population while the inner cities will have large, but mainly below average Black populations. This sketch of a historical model can only partially explain the results. The same sketch can be applied to the Hispanic-White gaps, though it is complicated as Hispanics were not freed from slavery but gradually immigrated in the last 100 years or so. However, the regression analyses show that associations to White % of population and Republican % of voters remain to some extent even adjusting for three measures of urban living (population density, urban % and suburban %). Thus, this account seems incomplete and is a topic for future research.Another possibility is that the effects seen after controls are causal effects, and that despite their poor reputation among journalists and academics, Republicans do tend to promote more functional institutions that result in relatively smaller race gaps. This could be due to rejection of Black ghetto culture or purely meritocratic (achievement focused) policies in schools, which would promote individual effort and thereby raise scholastic ability and later life outcomes among Blacks relative to Blacks who received an anti-schooling influence in school (Riley, 2016). Such an account has been suggested by multiple authors. These results can be seen as an example of a lower-performing ethnic group adopting the dominant group‚Äôs culture and this being a net benefit to them. This would be the within society version of beneficial cultural colonialism (Gilley 2017).The present study does not have a way to quantify this true causal influence of Whites or Republicans versus more cryptic self-selection effects. The fact that a large proportion of the effects were reduced given imperfect controls suggest that the true causal effect sizes are even closer to zero, though not necessarily zero. A future research design that could test these competing models would be to analyze the polygenic scores for intelligence and SES traits of Blacks living in various areas. If these confirm the patterns in the study, it may not be necessary to assign a causal effect to White population shares or Republican voting shares. If, however, the human capital polygenic scores of Blacks living in these areas are not higher than those in city areas with low White population shares and low Republican vote shares, the causal effects become much more plausible.5 LimitationsFirst, we used all available data for county-level racial gaps, but had data for only about half the counties, as the remaining had too low numbers of Black and Hispanic kids to allow for gap estimates (fewer than 20 persons, or if the reliability of the estimate was below .70). It is possible these unseen counties would change the results. However, this is unlikely due to their small population counts, and thus small weights in the models.Second, all the analyses were cross-sectional. Such analyses cannot establish causality by themselves. Thus, the coefficients of the regressions should not be taken as prima facie estimates of the direct causal effects of each variable. However, cross-sectional analyses can falsify some causal models that make strong predictions of associations that should exist. If such are found not to exist, doubt is thrown on the model that produced them (Bayesian modus tollens). This was the case with White systemic racism theory whose predictions were nearly uniformly contradicted by the data.","Systemic racism theory predicts that counties where there are more White people and where people are more racist against non-Whites should have larger race gaps on cognitive measures. We used county-level data from the United States to test these predictions of the systemic racism model. We used cognitive test results from state scholastic tests from the Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA) 4.1, which provided data for Black-White and Hispanic-White gaps from 1,473 and 1,750 counties, respectively. Contrary to predictions from the systemic racism model, we find that cognitive race gaps are smaller in counties with more Republicans: r‚Äôs with %Republican are -.54 and -.59 for Black-White and Hispanic-White gaps, respectively. Gaps also tend to be smaller where there are more White people, with correlations of %White with Black-White and Hispanic-White gaps of r = -.30 and -.38 (all results p < .001). We furthermore used data from Project Implicit as a measure of latent racism against Blacks. However, these also tended to have the wrong direction of results: Higher implicit anti-Black racism was associated with smaller cognitive gaps. Regression modeling reduced the effect sizes, but not the general pattern of directions. The same pattern was also seen for social status gaps as the outcome variable. Results were entirely contrary to the predictions of the systemic racism model.","7",0,"7","Political",6,0

Evolution and Human Behavior, 43(1), 44‚Äì52. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2021.09.003","When budgets were limited, men spent more on status and mate-seeking qualities than women, whereas women spent more on emotional support qualities than men, suggesting that, as predicted, the sexes prioritize different qualities in friends. However, when men and women have high budgets, they exhibited similar friendship spending patterns, suggesting that‚Äîwhen they can afford it‚Äîmen and women equally value all friendship qualities, as expected.
Although our focus here is on exploring and explaining sex differences in friendship preferences, we also note the striking similarities exhibited by men and women at both the high and low budget levels. Across preference categories, men and women largely choose to invest their friend dollars into the same qualities‚Äîfor example, prioritizing emotional support and allyship over strength in conflict and status. These findings suggest that friends who are supportive and loyal are prized no matter one's sex, and thus friends with these qualities are likely to generate high association values for both men and women.8.1. General discussion
In three studies, we find that (1) when friendship preferences are examined within several functional preference categories, sex differences reliably emerge. When examining ideal friend preferences and qualities of real-world friends (Studies 1 and 2), (2) compared to women, men preferred friends who exhibit strength in conflict, possess resources, and afford access to potential mates. In contrast, (3) women, compared to men, preferred friends who are loyal in conflicts, are emotionally invested in the friendship, and will help guard mates against potential romantic rivals. Study 3 examined sex differences in prioritization of friend qualities using a budget paradigm. (4) When the budget for preferences was unconstrained, men and women exhibited similar spending patterns, suggesting that both men and women want friends who offer positive benefits (i.e., those with high association value). When forced to make tradeoffs between various friendship qualities, however, sex differences again emerged, such that (5) men‚Äîrelative to women‚Äîprioritized friends who have high status and who afford access to potential mates, whereas women‚Äîrelative to men‚Äîprioritized friends who provide kin-like emotional support.These findings highlight an important gap in the literature on friendship preferences. Much of this literature‚Äîunderstandably‚Äîfocuses on the friendship qualities both sexes want in friends (e.g., similarity, proximity, kindness). Some of these preferences may derive from men and women facing many of the same recurrent challenges, which they historically solved with friends' help. Everyone benefits from friends who are (selectively) generous to them (e.g., Barakzai & Shaw, 2018). Pushing past these default conceptualizations of good friends and attending to the somewhat distinct problems that friendships historically helped men and women to solve, we predicted‚Äîand found‚Äîthat, first, men and women prefer friends who afford positive benefits (i.e., have high association value). However, solving particular adaptive problems may be best facilitated by somewhat different friendship qualities, suggesting that what it means to be a high association-value friend can differ by the sex of the person making that determination. Indeed, when we examined people's friendship preferences as a function of which specific qualities are prioritized, we find, second, clear sex differences consistently emerged‚Äîboth for ideal and actual friends. Moreover, the patterns of these differences largely follow what would be expected given existing literature on the evolved functions of men and women's friendships (e.g., Benenson, 2014; Geary, 1998).There were, however, a number of friendship preference categories for which sex differences did not reliably manifest. For example, no significant sex differences were found in Studies 1 and 2 for the skills/expertise and coalition-building categories. These findings seem somewhat inconsistent with literature suggesting that men tend to seek friends who are skilled across multiple areas and look to different friends to fulfill different needs (Barth & Kinder, 1988). Perhaps this is because we left the content of the skills unspecified, leading to ambiguity in the meaning and importance of this particular preference category. Notably, Eisenbruch and Roney (2020) have found the hypothesized sex difference when examining particular skills that would have been more relevant to men ancestrally (e.g., hunting). With respect to the coalition-building category, our intent was to capture the extent to which one's friend can help to build a strong coalition‚Äîone of the primary putative functions of male friendship. However, the scale items within this category instead seem to capture general loyalty and commitment‚Äîan important characteristic for both male and female friendships (e.g., Cottrell et al., 2007).8.2. Limitations and future directions
In light of past literature, we identified several preference dimensions that might show sex differences in prioritization. This list, of course, is not exhaustive. For example, it did not include a number of friend preferences‚Äîsuch as trustworthiness, similarity, proximity, and familiarity‚Äîthat are often discussed in social psychological literature, in part because we did not expect these to differ between the sexes. Indeed, we again underscore the notion that‚Äîjust as men and women both chiefly prefer mates who are kind and intelligent‚Äîmen and women likely faced many of the same recurrent challenges, and are therefore likely to share more evolved friend preferences in common than not. Here, we explicitly focused on the distinct, likely sex-typical challenges men and women might have used their friends to help them solve. In Study 2, for instance, both sexes were near ceiling in reporting the importance of same-sex friends who won't poach their mates, implying that both sexes highly prize loyal, trustworthy friends (Cottrell et al., 2007).In a similar vein, men and women might also solve similar challenges in different ways. For example, both sexes compete with same-sex rivals for desirable other-sex mates, and when they do, women tend to prefer using subtle, covert, and indirect tools in their intrasexual competition, whereas men use both indirect and more direct (e.g., physical aggression) modes of competition (e.g., Vaillancourt, 2013). In the minds of men versus women, then, a friend with high association value when it comes to helping compete for desirable mates might exhibit different behavior, which nevertheless helps a person reach their mating goal (e.g., a woman's same-sex friend might provide her with reputation-poisoning information about a rival, whereas a man's same-sex friend might help him physically confront the rival; see Benenson & Abdazi, 2020; Hess & Hagen, 2019).
Participants evidenced some sex-differentiated friend preferences in line with theorizing about the problems that men's and women's friends helped them to solve over our evolutionary history. It is possible, however, that men and women also face some distinct, novel challenges in the modern world. Our theorizing here is premised on the likelihood that many of these modern challenges somewhat reflect ancestrally-recurrent ones. Future work may benefit not only from further examining this assumption, but also from exploring areas of mismatches between our evolved friend preferences and the challenges that friends help us solve in the modern world.Although our study demonstrated some consistent sex differences in friendship preferences, one might have wished to have undertaken a factor analysis to identify the broader constructs underlying the items used here. Due to our sample sizes (e.g., Gorsuch, 1983), we were not able to compare these theoretically derived preferences to quantitatively derived latent constructs. Future studies could address this limitation by ensuring a large enough sample size to conduct factor analyses. Additionally, as some of our preferences were assessed with only two or three measured items (i.e., physical conflict strength, allyship, mate seeking, mate guarding, skills/ expertise, and resources), future studies would benefit from creating and including additional items to better assess these preferences via factor analysis.
We additionally note that Studies 1 and 2 were self-report of ideal friend preferences and actual best friend qualities, whereas Study 3, though borrowing from behavioral economics (see Lewis et al., 2011; Li et al., 2002), was also essentially self-report. As such, these studies possess those limitations associated with self-report methods. In additional to behavioral work, examinations of sex similarities and differences in friend preferences in the ethnographic record (e.g., electronic Human Relations Areas Files) could be one means of addressing this limitation.Indeed, a fruitful avenue for future research would be to examine friendship preferences across cultures. Cross-cultural sex similarities and differences in mating preferences are well-established (Buss, 1989; Walter et al., 2020). Might sex differences in friendship preferences be similarly robust? On the one hand, the adaptive challenges historically faced by men and women are not culturally bound. On the other hand, the modern functions and/or constraints of same-sex friendships may vary by culture (e.g., the extent to which friendships are prioritized compared to other social relationships). For example, friendships in some cultures are commonly life-long, becoming as deep and consequential as kin relationships (e.g., blood brothers; DeScioli & Kurzban, 2012; Evans-Pritchard, 1933), whereas friendships in some other cultures are more transitory. These cultural features should influence which qualities contribute to friends' association values for men and women. Likewise, given that evolved preferences are flexibly responsive to other features of the environment, there may be ecological variables (e.g., geographic isolation, relational mobility) that promote meaningful differences in preferred friendship qualities.Above, we noted that friends can help us solve various challenges, and to the extent these challenges historically differed for the sex, men and women might prefer some different features in their same-sex friends. Sex is but one dimension that influences the challenges one is likely to face at any one time. What people prize in friends might vary as a function of age as well, for example. One implication of this is that men's and women's friend preferences might change across the lifespan. Any feature of the life history that has historically and reliably covaried with specific adaptive challenges could be useful in predicting what a person values and thus the qualities that go into their calculation of a friend's association value.9. Conclusion
Across evolutionary time, men's and women's friendships helped solve somewhat different challenges and/or solve similar challenges in different ways; thus, these friendships might have differed in form and function (and might continue to do so even today). By considering the specific problems that friendships evolved to help solve, we can derive predictions about which qualities of friends and friendships best achieved those functions‚Äîand thus, predictions about which qualities the mind should be attuned to identify and prioritize for men and women. In a series of three studies, we find that men's and women's friendship preferences indeed prioritize somewhat different qualities. Taking into account the different sex-linked functions of friendships adds nuance to our understanding of friendship psychology.","Friendships can help us solve a number of challenges, increasing our welfare and fitness. Across evolutionary time, some of the many challenges that friendships helped to solve may have differed between men and women. By considering the specific and potentially distinct recurrent problems men's and women's friendships helped them solve, we can derive predictions about the qualities that would have made men's and women's same-sex friends ideal partners. This logic leads to several predictions about the specific friend preferences that may be differentially prized by men and women. Across three studies (N = 745) with U.S. participants‚Äîassessing ideal hypothetical friends, actual friends, and using a paradigm adapted from behavioral economics‚Äîwe find that men, compared to women, more highly value same-sex friends who are physically formidable, possess high status, possess wealth, and afford access to potential mates. In contrast, women, compared to men, more highly value friends who provide emotional support, intimacy, and useful social information.

Throughout three studies with worldwide, statewide, individual-level, and longitudinal tracking data, we consistently found an inverse relation: more diversity, less stereotype dispersion. Participants in diverse contexts, especially those who report more diversity, evaluated ethnic groups as being more similar on warmth and competence stereotype dimensions. Diversity, paradoxically, reduces perceived group differences. Reduced group differences also correlate with greater subjective wellbeing and with more positive stereotypes in some contexts.
From Homophily to Adaptation.
The changes in mental representations of social groups provide one cognitive condition for the previously mixed findings of responses under diversity. For example, anticipating diversity (6), people initially expect group differences, that is, differentiated stereotypes that elicit threat and negativity toward outgroups. However, as actual diversity increases (6), with more exposure and experience, people may tone down previously exaggerated stereotypes, and start to realize latent and deep commonalities across groups, which eventually buffer against threat and yield more positive group relations over time. Such common ground‚Äîreduced stereotype dispersion‚Äîis the condition that the contact hypothesis hopes to achieve: the perception of common humanity (ref. 18, p. 281). It is also the condition that Nguyen realized: We share much more in common with one another than we have differences (1). Reduced stereotype dispersion may have created similarity attracting positive interactions (7‚Äì9), and this is indicated in our data by associations with positive outcomes.
The current studies provide evidence that diversity is associated with less stereotype dispersion, but they do not specify psychological mechanisms, which should be explored in the future.
Positivity.
We found some evidence showing that less stereotype dispersion relates to positive stereotype content. It is an open question why the single, less-dispersed mental map did not sit in middle‚àímiddle position. One possibility suggests norms (50). Diverse environments endorse tolerant norms that lead to more positive outgroup ratings. Another possibility is repeated exposure inducing attraction (51). The higher the exposure to outgroups, the more individuals attach positive affect to these groups, resulting in positive impressions. A third possibility is person positivity (52): Increased familiarity makes outgroups seem more personal and human, which, in turn, should produce more positive evaluations. A fourth possibility is similarity asymmetry (53). The societal ingroup (high-competence/high-warmth quadrant) is the reference group, so outgroup members are perceived to be similar to the societal ingroup, instead of the societal ingroup being similar to outgroups. Future work needs to test these mechanisms.
Process.
Mental maps of social groups‚Äô economic positions differ, especially among individuals who experience different information from local networks and who endorse different motivations (26, 27). Likewise, reduced stereotype dispersion under diversity will differ by experience and motivation.
Experience-updating models (54) would suggest that warmth and competence are abstract knowledge that people learn from initially sparse data and update based on new evidence. New data with low feature variability (as found in a homogeneous society) strengthens prior knowledge, such as larger stereotype dispersion. New data with high feature variability (as found in a diverse society) weakens or adjusts it, which may lead to smaller stereotype dispersion. Intergroup research suggests that people perceive ingroups as more heterogeneous (55), and as less extreme (56) than outgroups. Our result extends the scope by suggesting that extreme evaluations may come from differentiated stereotypes engrained in homogeneous environments, whereas less extreme evaluations may come from overlapping cognitive representations in diverse environments (57). When experiencing diversity, people may also break stereotype-inconsistent exemplars into new subtypes (58). In this context, new subtypes might make it easier to see overlaps across superordinate categories, which should lead to reduced stereotype dispersion. An alternative experience may come from category simplification. As the number of ethnic groups within a society increases, people might experience cognitive load. They could simplify the categories or shift away from immigrant or ethnic categories (59), which could also reduce stereotype dispersion.
Besides experience, motivation-based models (33) would suggest that people who live in diverse contexts want to get along with different others. This orientation toward outgroups, in turn, promotes more thoughtful, deliberate processes. People living in homogeneous contexts do not have such motivations and therefore use relatively automatic stereotypes (a dual-process model; ref. 32). Future work needs to disentangle the mechanisms and specify exactly how diversity reduces stereotype dispersion.
Generality.
Several directions would expand the scope. 1) One direction is assessing stereotype dimensions other than warmth and competence. Recent studies suggest ideological beliefs (60) and other unforeseen spontaneous contents (61) can be critical in impression formation. 2) Another is considering diversity other than ethnicity. Sexual orientation and ideological and religious beliefs are also important socially defined categories. 3) A third direction is examining causality. Demographic changes by themselves may influence mental representation of social groups, but randomized experiments need to substantiate. Experimentally increasing the perceived variability of outgroup members leads to more positive evaluations of those groups (62). Although, according to our reasoning, changes in group perception should be adjusted by continuous exposure (i.e., over a period of time) with large variations (i.e., larger scale), single-time or single-site manipulation can be further improved. 4) Yet another direction is linking cognition and behaviors. More research needs to test how changing mental representation in human minds influences consequential decision-making and action (27, 63).
Variations.
Overall, individuals adapt to increasing diversity in ways that are consonant with the coexistence of multiple groups. Reducing perceived differences between groups facilitates finding common ground and sharing social identity, and aids meaningful intergroup interactions. However, make no mistake: Diverse societies are not free of challenges that hamper the adaptive processes uncovered by our work. More threatening contexts characterized by segregation (16, 17, 49), ethnic conflict (13, 39), or sharp inequalities between ethnic groups (26, 27) can slow down or even curb adaptation to diversity. Majority‚àíminority dynamics may also create variations. Entering a more diverse demography can be very different in terms of power dynamics for people who are historically dominant versus underrepresented minorities. We observed that the association between diversity and stereotype dispersion was not conditional on participant‚Äôs group identities (see also SI Appendix, Tables S3‚ÄìS5). However, one procedural limitation is that we asked about shared societal stereotypes, but not group- or individual-specific opinions. Future work can address this limitation and explore group dynamics around diversity and social cognition.
Our work provides evidence of a possible pathway by which individual cognitions adapt to demographic changes in their social ecologies. The core finding‚Äîindividuals have in them the potential to embrace diversity‚Äîshould encourage societies to intervene against potential barriers to a peaceful coexistence. One positive characteristic of social diversity is the broadening of people‚Äôs horizons. Ironically, stereotype content maps of relevant groups show the opposite movement (i.e., groups represented in mental maps tend be become compressed together). However, perhaps broadening horizons means realizing that societal groups do not differ as much as individuals may initially imagine. Exposure to diversity teaches that fact.","With globalization and immigration, societal contexts differ in sheer variety of resident social groups. Social diversity challenges individuals to think in new ways about new kinds of people and where their groups all stand, relative to each other. However, psychological science does not yet specify how human minds represent social diversity, in homogeneous or heterogenous contexts. Mental maps of the array of society‚Äôs groups should differ when individuals inhabit more and less diverse ecologies. Nonetheless, predictions disagree on how they should differ. Confirmation bias suggests more diversity means more stereotype dispersion: With increased exposure, perceivers‚Äô mental maps might differentiate more among groups, so their stereotypes would spread out (disperse). In contrast, individuation suggests more diversity means less stereotype dispersion, as perceivers experience within-group variety and between-group overlap. Worldwide, nationwide, individual, and longitudinal datasets (n = 12,011) revealed a diversity paradox: More diversity consistently meant less stereotype dispersion. Both contextual and perceived ethnic diversity correlate with decreased stereotype dispersion. Countries and US states with higher levels of ethnic diversity (e.g., South Africa and Hawaii, versus South Korea and Vermont), online individuals who perceive more ethnic diversity, and students who moved to more ethnically diverse colleges mentally represent ethnic groups as more similar to each other, on warmth and competence stereotypes. Homogeneity shows more-differentiated stereotypes; ironically, those with the least exposure have the most-distinct stereotypes. Diversity means less-differentiated stereotypes, as in the melting pot metaphor. Diversity and reduced dispersion also correlate positively with subjective wellbeing.","1",0,"1","Political",2,0

We have determined that zoogeographic regions explain the preponderance of the variance in National IQ across the sampled polities. Furthermore, we have determined that zoogeographic regions, as macroecological categories, can be used to succinctly summarize much of the cross-national variance in several key ecological parameters: average annual temperature, average annual precipitation, human parasite burden, and human slow life history strategy. Some of these continuous ecological parameters had been used previously in various single-factor theories for the evolution of cognitive ability. We have reviewed claims that had been made by each of these successive theories that each of their preferred ‚Äúsingle-factor‚Äù explanations entirely subsumed the others, and that this preferred predictor completely mediated the alternative predictors, the final one being the only direct evolutionary cause of National IQ. We have seen that this is not the case, in that none of the major ‚Äúsingle-factors‚Äù that have been proposed completely mediates all the others.

This can be illustrated by examining the following exploratory path model: Fig. 2 graphically represents the results of a sequential canonical cascade analysis (see Appendix 1 for statistical details) including only the relations among average annual temperature, human parasite burden, and human slow life history strategy, to represent the three major ‚Äúsingle-factor‚Äù theories. It is evident from this path diagram that there are statistically significant residual direct effects from each of the prior constructs to each of the successive ones within the sequence. This finding indicates that each of the successive constructs only partially mediates all the previous ones. To be fair, however, we do note that the path coefficients are substantially greater in magnitude along the main sequence hypothesized, as represented by the series of three diagonal arrows in the diagram. The purpose of the path diagram was therefore not to deny or even minimize the high degree of mediation, even if only partial, but instead to show the interconnectedness of the entire system of relationships. We believe that the interconnectedness of this system supports our proposed use of zoogeographic regions as macroecological categories that summarize these covarying environmental parameters.

Theoretical Considerations
The essence of human intelligence is more or less equivalent to what in nonhuman animals we variously call developmental, behavioral, or phenotypic plasticity, so a brief discussion of the evolutionary dynamics of this phenomenon is warranted (for a more detailed discussion, see Figueredo, Hammond, & McKiernan, 2006). Invariant instincts and routinized behavioral repertoires are believed to be bioenergetically cheaper alternatives to the phenotypic plasticity afforded by human cognitive abilities, for reasons articulated in the expensive brain hypothesis. Phenotypic plasticity allows one genotype to adopt a plurality of phenotypic responses (Davies, Krebs, & West, 2012). Complete canalization of traits is avoided by rudimentary forms of phenotypic plasticity, whether developmentally expressed as temperature-dependent sex-allocation, morphologically expressed among certain beetles and salmon, or seasonally expressed as cyclical responses to photoperiod (Brakefield & Zwaan, 2011). When the average fitness of individuals with plastic strategies exceeds that of individuals with fixed strategies, more elaborate manifestations of phenotypic plasticity can evolve (Czesak, Fox, & Wolf, 2006).

Theoretically, developmental plasticity and behavioral flexibility have been posited to evolve under conditions of increased environmental variability (Figueredo, Hammond, & McKiernan, 2006). More specifically, human general intelligence has been posited to be selected in response to environmental novelty that confronted individuals with evolutionarily unfamiliar problems to solve (Kanazawa, 2012). Based on that evolved plasticity and flexibility, phenotypic accommodation to environmental changes has been posited to be a major driving force in evolution by leading to subsequent genetic accommodation, as shaped by the action of selection on natural variation in the adaptive consequences of the gene-environment interactions triggered (West-Eberhard, 2003).

As recently explained by Richerson and Boyd (2020):
""Cultural evolutionists have proposed that culture in humans is an evolutionarily active system that can even act as a selective force on genes. Defenders of the Modern Synthesis can be quite intemperate in their rejection of such heresy. However, there are good examples of culture-led gene-culture coevolution in the case of humans. For example, Richerson & Boyd‚Äôs tribal social instincts hypothesis conjectures that group selection on cultural variation operating via social selection (selective rewards and punishments) acting on genes shaped our innate social psychology, making us more docile, for example. If so, cultural evolution is playing an ultimate role alongside genes in human evolution. Likewise, we think that the human life history coevolved with culture, often driven by cultural innovations.""

We therefore believe it reasonable to conclude that the great human migrations out of Africa into entirely new habitats and ambient ecologies must have provided the hypothesized selective pressures for enhanced cognitive abilities.

Human cognitive abilities may well represent the most baroque expression of phenotypic plasticity among animals. Accordingly, like any form of phenotypic plasticity, the evolution of cognitive ability is subject to a cost‚Äìbenefit balance sheet, as recognized by single-factor theories as well as by the present zoogeographic reconceptualization of those ecological determinants. The zoogeographic regions used to explain geographic variation in intelligence amount to a macroecological level of organization, subsuming the physical ecological factors emphasized in cold winters theory and the community ecological factors emphasized in parasite stress theory, to the end of more fully delineating both sides of the cost‚Äìbenefit ledger.

With pull and push factors juxtaposed, disparities in cross-regional levels of cognitive ability can be seen to arise from the simultaneous release from the brake of parasite stress and the spur of cold winters. Furthermore, the zoogeographic regions approach is broader in scope than the life history theory of human cognitive ability in that it encompasses the entire ecological system of relationships rather than the set of bioenergetic tradeoffs characteristic of any single species within it.

Of course, neither the single-factor nor the macroecological theories are exhaustive of theories regarding the evolution of human intelligence. Notable among alternatives are the expanded ecology hypothesis (e.g., Gonz√°lez-Forero & Gardner, 2018) and the social brain hypothesis (Dunbar, 1998). However, these theories both exclusively address the differences in brain development among different species of nonhuman primates as well as between humans and all other species of primates. These theories therefore relate only to between-species differences. Neither theory, as far as we are aware, makes any predictions regarding how humans evolving within different zoogeographical regions might have adapted to different resource allocations to brain development (and hence intelligence). Our theory therefore relates instead to within-species differences.

One could conceivably try to extend these other theories (both the expanded ecology hypothesis and the social brain hypothesis) to within-species differences, but it would be a stretch of which we are not sure the original proponents of the theories would necessarily approve.
","After many waves of out-migration from Africa, different human populations evolved within a great diversity of physical and community ecologies. These ambient ecologies should have at least partially determined the selective pressures that shaped the evolution and geographical distribution of human cognitive abilities across different parts of the world. Three different ecological hypotheses have been advanced to explain human global variation in intelligence: (1) cold winters theory (Lynn, 1991), (2) parasite stress theory (Eppig, Fincher, & Thornhill, 2010), and (3) life history theory (Rushton, 1999, 2000). To examine and summarize the relations among these and other ecological parameters, we divided a sample of 98 national polities for which we had sufficient information into zoogeographical regions (Wallace, 1876; Holt et al., 2013). We selected only those regions for this analysis that were still inhabited mostly by the aboriginal populations that were present there prior to the fifteenth century AD. We found that these zoogeographical regions explained 71.4% of the variance among national polities in our best measure of human cognitive ability, and also more concisely encapsulated the preponderance of the more specific information contained within the sampled set of continuous ecological parameters.","6",0,"6","Political",5,1

Generality across place, levels, and time further support the framework. Similar dimensions have emerged repeatedly over the history of psychology and in current theories. The SCM proposes and tests a comprehensive causal theory: Perceived social structure (cooperation, status) predicts stereotypes (warmth, competence), which in turn predict emotional prejudices (pride, pity, contempt, envy), and finally, the emotions predict discrimination (active and passive help and harm). The SCM uncovers systematic content and dynamics of stereotypes, which has practical implications.","4",1,"4","Apolitical",4,0

Perspectives on Psychological Science. https://doi.org/10.1177/17456916231202685","General DiscussionOur primary aim in this study was to review and systematize previous literature that examined the association between living conditions and psychological sex differences (old analyses). We summarized 54 studies and 133 dependent variables in the old analyses. The secondary aim was to investigate associations between living conditions and sex differences by using data mainly from meta-analyses to broaden and replicate previously published findings and avoid publication bias (new analyses). We analyzed an additional 27 studies and 45 dependent variables in the new analyses. Taken together, more than 70 indicators of living conditions have been used (see Table S1 in the Supplemental Material). We draw three conclusions from our analysis. First, sex differences in personality, verbal episodic memory, verbal ability, aggressive behavior, female negative emotions, depression, and general self-esteem are larger in countries with higher living conditions. By contrast, sex differences in mathematics, semantic memory, sexual behavior, partner preferences, and aggression toward partners are smaller in countries with higher living conditions. No systematic associations were observed between sex differences in the remaining assessed psychological capacities and behaviors (e.g., Academic Self-Concept, Spatial skills) and living conditions. Second, although results indicate that most of the assessed indicators of living conditions are not associated with the magnitude of the sex differences, results from both the old analyses and new analyses demonstrate that more sex differences are larger, rather than smaller, in countries with higher living conditions. Moreover, third, it seems that economic indicators of living conditions (e.g., GDP) are the most sensitive indicators in detecting associations with the magnitude of sex differences and that indicators of gender equality are less sensitive. Below, we discuss these findings, their relevance, and some limitations of the study.Conclusion 1: sex differences in countries with higher living conditionsHow should one understand the pattern showing that men and women tend to be more alike in some regards and more dissimilar in others in countries with higher living conditions? The explanations are probably not the same for all psychological dimensions.Personal characteristics. The categories showing the most consistent and convincing results are those relating to personality, demonstrating that sex differences are larger in countries with higher living conditions. This effect, sometimes referred to as the ‚Äúgender-equality paradox,‚Äù has been reported previously. It has been argued that these findings lend support to the resource hypothesis over the social-role hypothesis. The resource hypothesis rests on the assumption that free expression of preferences requires meeting basic material needs and that when basic needs are met, sex-specific goals can develop. Thus, countries with higher living conditions presumably would allow females and males to pursue the values they care about more freely (i.e., presumably not because of social-role expectations). A more free expression would, in turn, result in larger sex differences in countries with higher living conditions. This hypothesis is supported by results from the old analyses (Costa et al., 2001; Falk & Hermle, 2018; Giolla & Kajonius, 2019; Kaiser, 2019) and, more importantly, by results from the new analyses (Grijalva et  al., 2015; Miller et  al., 2008; Randler & Engelke, 2019; Yang & Girgus, 2019).Cognition. For cognition, some sex differences show a female advantage, and others show a male advantage.  Our results suggest that in those cognitive abilities in which females perform at a higher level than men (episodic memory, verbal abilities), sex differences are larger in countries with higher living conditions. By contrast, sex differences in those cognitive abilities in which males perform at a higher level (math, semantic memory), sex differences are smaller in countries with higher living conditions. These data suggest that more than men, females benefit cognitively from societal improvements, giving rise to larger sex differences in episodic memory and verbal abilities and smaller sex differences in math and semantic memory. This interpretation of the results is in line with other findings showing that increased exposure to cognitive stimulation, economic prosperity, health improvements, and changes in average family size is associated with increases in cognitive performance over time (i.e., the Flynn effect; Flynn, 1987; Pietschnig & Voracek, 2015). Our results are also consistent with those that showed that females have a larger Flynn effect than males (Weber et al., 2017). Although it is still an open question why women appear to be more positively affected by improved living conditions than men, it could be hypothesized that women benefit disproportionately from societal improvements because they may start from a more disadvantaged position. This assumption can be compared with a group with only 1 year of schooling that would experience a greater improvement from an extra year compared with a group that had several years of education. However, spatial skills do not seem to follow this pattern; one study indicated larger sex differences (favoring males) in countries with higher living conditions (Lippa et al., 2010), and other studies showed no association with living conditions. Thus, more research on spatial abilities is needed before concluding that higher living conditions are associated with smaller sex differences in all those cognitive abilities for which males have an advantage.Interpersonal behavior. Another area in which the pattern of results is consistent and systematic is sexuality and partner preference, for which differences are smaller in countries with higher living conditions. Sex differences in sexual behavior have typically been explained from an evolutionary perspective through the parental-investment theory (Schmitt, 2005; Trivers, 1972). The theory underlines that males and females differ significantly in the time and energy devoted to the offspring, mostly because females carry the child for 9 months and because unrestricted sexual behavior can yield only one offspring at a time. By contrast, the number of offspring a male can produce during the same period is substantially higher. Because of this, unrestricted sexual behavior is a more viable evolutionary strategy for males than for females. However, this evolutionary explanation does not preclude that environmental factors can further restrict sexuality. Results that showed sex differences in sexual behavior are smaller in countries with higher living conditions imply that female sexuality is affected by living conditions (e.g., availability of contraceptives or cultural restrictions on freely pursuing sexual desires). Sex differences in partner preference have often been explained from an evolutionary perspective as well (Buss & Schmitt, 2019). According to this perspective, males prefer features that signal youth and fertility, whereas females focus more on status and resource acquisition. Our results show that sex differences in partner preference are smaller in countries with higher living conditions, suggesting that these preferences to some degree depend on living conditions such as women‚Äôs earning capacity and cultural norms.Emotions and mental health. Results for sex differences in emotions and mental health show some consistency. It seems that sex differences in those negative emotions that are more prevalent/stronger in females are more prominent in countries with higher living conditions. By contrast, the female advantage in feelings of happiness is smaller in those countries. Consistent with this pattern, there is weak evidence suggesting that sex differences in negative emotions that are more prevalent/stronger in males are smaller in countries with higher living conditions. Also in accordance with this pattern are findings in mental health showing that females‚Äô higher levels of symptoms and diagnosed depression are greater in countries with higher living conditions. Overall, these results suggest that higher living conditions are associated with higher adverse effects on emotions and mental health in females than in males.Conclusion 2: implications of robust sex differencesAs illustrated by the large proportion of sex differences that remain unaffected by living conditions, the robustness of the sex differences across countries is striking. Although many of the sex differences reported in the 54 studies reviewed in the old analyses and the 27 meta-analyses analyzed in the new analyses are small, they are systematic and reliable across countries. Moreover, the old analyses and the new analyses results demonstrate that more sex differences are larger, rather than smaller, in countries with higher living conditions. What are the implications of these findings? If there is a causal relationship between living conditions and psychological sex differences, and not just a correlation, one important implication is that there is little to indicate that psychological sex differences will disappear in the future even if living conditions, including gender equality, continue to increase.Although many of the psychological sex differences are minor, several small sex differences in fundamental areas of psychological functioning may generate larger differences in everyday composite behaviors (Eagly & Revelle, 2022). For instance, considering personal characteristics, including personality and traits such as selfesteem and altruism, we find that they affect people‚Äôs behaviors and choices in many situations. Among other things, Big Five traits predict political preferences. To illustrate, people who score high in openness to experience and low in conscientiousness tend to be more left-leaning (Mondak & Halperin, 2008). By extension, larger sex differences in these traits might reinforce political divisions along gender lines. Arguably, then, even a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù difference could have considerable effects.An area that has received plenty of attention from policymakers and others is sex differences in educational and occupational choices. Attempts have been made in countries with relatively high levels of gender equality to reduce these differences. Research shows that cognitive strengths are related to academic strengths and that individuals adjust their educational and occupational choices with their academic strengths (Dekhtyar et al., 2018). Because more males exhibit technical/numerical skills and more females exhibit verbal/language skills, these findings imply that sex differences in academic skills likely contribute to the horizontal gender segregation in education and occupation (Dekhtyar et al., 2018). A further implication is that gender segregation in education and occupation will be difficult to avoid altogether, at least if individuals can freely pursue educational and occupational career paths and base these choices on academic strengths.Conclusion 3: important indicatorsWe found that indicators of economy (mainly GDP) were more sensitive in detecting associations with sex differences than indicators of gender equality in both the old analyses and new analyses. Indicators of gender equality displayed a relatively small proportion of significant results (12% in the new analyses and 48% in the old analyses). By contrast, indicators of economic development displayed a higher proportion of significant results (20% in the new analyses and 56% in the old analyses). A priori, it might seem that indicators taking dimensions of gender equality into account should be the most predictive of psychological sex differences. The fact that this was not the case might be connected to differences in the historical and crossnational availability of the indicators. Economic indicators, such as GDP, are available for most countries as far back as 1960. By contrast, most indicators of gender equality are either not time-specific or start only in the mid-1990s. This relative lack of variance in the genderequality data may make effects less apparent.Another possible reason as to why economic indicators are particularly sensitive in detecting associations with psychological sex differences concerns the way greater economic prosperity alters educational and occupational structures (e.g., K. Block et  al., 2022; Charles & Bradley, 2009; Wong & Charles, 2020). In most countries, female labor-force participation has increased substantially in the last century (Ortiz-Ospina & Tzvetkova, 2017). Nonetheless, occupational gender segregation is notable. For instance, globally, a large part of people working in health care, education, and social services are female, whereas a greater share of males is found in areas requiring physical strength and technical skills (e.g., Statistics Sweden, 2020; Wong & Charles, 2020). Occupational gender segregation also manifests as a greater share of females than males working part-time, a form of employment that is more prevalent in countries with higher living conditions (e.g., Ortiz-Ospina & Tzvetkova, 2017). Plausibly, the economically driven growth of these female-dominated sectors and forms of employment would strengthen and reinforce psychological sex differences. As more females enter the labor market in ‚Äúfemale‚Äù professional roles, they might internalize the ‚Äúfemale‚Äù values of these roles, such as the care-oriented values of some healthcare professions.This point is central to the social-role theory proposed by Eagly and Wood (1999, 2012). They argued that the gendered division of labor is originally rooted in sex differences in physical attributes. These differences led women and men to take on different social roles that, in turn, led to shared beliefs, or stereotypes, regarding males‚Äô and females‚Äô social roles. With increased economic prosperity and the appearance of new jobs viewed as suitable to the female social role, more women become socialized to the occupations they pursue. We would thus expect to find larger psychological sex differences in countries with higher living conditions. This offers an explanation of the gender-equality paradox that is distinct from those that rely on innate gender-specific preferences. To further investigate the viability of the respective explanations, comprehensive year- and country-specific indicators of occupational gender segregation would be needed. Analyses of these data could help to determine whether occupational gender segregation is the reason why economic indicators were most sensitive in predicting psychological sex differences.Advantages and limitationsOur systematic review has several advantages. First, the search for published articles was done systematically and objectively, thereby ensuring that we identified the most relevant articles. Second, we could broaden and replicate previously published findings and avoid publication bias by empirically investigating associations between living conditions and sex differences because the results in the new analyses have never been analyzed, presented, or published previously.Although our review of previous results and new analyses have contributed to a better understanding of the associations between indicators of living conditions and psychological sex differences, it also has some limitations. First, relatively few studies on psychological dimensions have collected data from enough countries to warrant inclusion in the present study. Furthermore, the difficulties in collecting reliable data from many countries have sometimes forced researchers to rely on the same data sets, leading to similar research questions and analyses. As a result, we have some duplicate findings in the old analyses, often regarding the PISA data set. Taken together, we present a limited and nonexhaustive depiction of psychological sex differences and the association between these sex differences and living conditions.The old analyses, comprising published analyses, often provide a more coherent pattern of findings than the new analyses, which present previously unpublished results. This fact might indicate publication bias, that is, a state of affairs in which the publication of results depends on the significance and direction of effects detected and not solely on research quality. However, other factors may contribute to this pattern as well. The old analyses included a greater proportion of data for which tests and tasks were the same in all assessed countries and study sites, making data less susceptible to noise, thereby making effects more easily detectable. By contrast, in the new analyses, we always used data collected for meta-analyses, which typically consist of data from many studies, often using different tests and instruments to assess sex differences in the underlying psychological dimensions. Thus, these studies inherently have more noise in the data. The new analyses may therefore provide a more conservative test of the hypotheses but also possibly hide true effects. To detect more nuance and, hopefully, identify systematic but weak patterns of results, we chose to also report marginally significant associations.Moreover, for many studies in the old analyses, there may have been prior theoretical grounds or findings underlying the decision to investigate associations between living conditions and certain sex differences. A collection of studies taking this approach is likely to find a greater proportion of significant effects than a less selective investigation of many areas. Indeed, the psychological dimensions investigated in the old analyses are rarely the same as those in the new analyses.Limitations can occur when investigating potential associations between behavioral measures and living conditions. Researchers‚Äô analyses are generally confined by the limited number of publicly available indicators, often provided by the UN, World Bank, and OECD. These indicators typically offer crude summary measures of the underlying construct of interest. Furthermore, the indicators may not be available for all years/countries of interest, and this absence became more of a problem further back in time. The limited availability of early data is important because it may lead to an underestimation of the actual associations between living conditions and psychological sex differences. For instance, for any given age cohort, the living conditions of greatest interest are likely those of the participants‚Äô formative years, not at the age when being assessed. Having no access to the living conditions from the formative years, which may be the case with older participants, is a troublesome constraint. Taken together, indicators of living conditions can be unspecific measures of the actual living conditions and may therefore provide an underestimation of their real effect.Another limitation is that when we state that there are larger or smaller sex differences in countries with higher living conditions, the underlying pattern of male and female scores cannot be determined (for an illustration and further explanation, see Fig. 10). This problem arises because data from meta-analyses comprise contrasts between males and females (i.e., effect sizes) rather than absolute values that are comparable between studies.5 Future research using digital data collections of the same measures in wider geographic settings will allow researchers to address such issues.Furthermore, we have investigated only linear relationships between living conditions and sex differences in the new analyses despite the possibility of nonlinear associations. The main reason is that it enabled us to compare our results with those in the old analyses more easily. Future large-scale studies should investigate such potential nonlinear associations between living conditions and sex differences.","Some studies show that living conditions, such as economy, gender equality, and education, are associated with the magnitude of psychological sex differences. We systematically and quantitatively reviewed 54 articles and conducted new analyses on 27 meta-analyses and large-scale studies to investigate the association between living conditions and psychological sex differences. We found that sex differences in personality, verbal abilities, episodic memory, and negative emotions are more pronounced in countries with higher living conditions. In contrast, sex differences in sexual behavior, partner preferences, and math are smaller in countries with higher living conditions. We also observed that economic indicators of living conditions, such as gross domestic product, are most sensitive in predicting the magnitude of sex differences. Taken together, results indicate that more sex differences are larger, rather than smaller, in countries with higher living conditions. It should therefore be expected that the magnitude of most psychological sex differences will remain unchanged or become more pronounced with improvements in living conditions, such as economy, gender equality, and education.","6",0,"6","Political",4,1

American Politics Research, 53(1), 28‚Äì35. https://doi.org/10.1177/1532673x241273220","Using data from the 2016 and 2020 ANES, these results confirm that living in and identifying with a more rural area corresponds with less trust in the federal government. This relationship is observed during both Democratic and Republican presidencies, across multiple survey measurements of place and place-based identity, and after controlling for several demographic and political factors. As a result, I find evidence for both tested hypotheses and provide national level quantitative support for past research observing negative attitudes towards government as a component of rural consciousness (Cramer 2012; 2016).This study contributes to the existing scholarship both on America‚Äôs urban-rural divide and on political trust by examining the relationship between this critical political divide and public opinion on the federal government. Additionally, these findings deepen our understanding of rural consciousness by finding consistent results for both residential and psychological conceptualizations of rurality, furthering research on the relationship between place and place-based identity as distinctive but related variables. It is also significant that this work demonstrates the relationship between rurality and political trust in different partisan government contexts, given the close connection between partisanship, incumbency, and trust in government. While important work in comparative politics have found evidence of similar relationships between rurality and political distrust in the United Kingdom (McKay et al., 2021) and in Europe broadly (Mitsch et al., 2021), I confirm that this relationship is also present among Americans. Finally, this work opens opportunities for deeper exploration of the social, political, and economic causal mechanisms behind rural political distrust and reinforces the need for greater investigation at the intersection of racial and ethnic politics and political geography.Evidence that rural Americans may be less trusting of government presents various implications for both politics and public policy. Geographically conditioned levels of trust in the federal government raises questions for partisan leaders‚ÄîRepublicans seeking to expand their success in rural communities as well as Democrats searching to regain appeal in these regions. Beyond these partisan implications, higher levels of distrust of the federal government among Americans living in or identifying with more rural areas are also relevant to a wide range of potential public policy implications. These include issues of public health, such as acceptance of COVID-19 vaccinations in rural communities (Ivory et al., 2021; Jackson & Chablani, 2021), but more broadly raise questions about the effectiveness and approach of expanded federal government programs to support rural areas (Colman & Adragna, 2021).Evidence suggests that rural political distrust in Europe is driven by communal but localized perceptions that rural areas are being left behind by the government (Mitsch et al., 2021). In this study of the American context, the persistence of rural political distrust in the federal government across both Democratic and Republican presidential administrations suggests that many rural Americans also feel ‚Äúleft behind‚Äù by government regardless of who is seen as leading the government. Overall, these results show that across both Europe and the United States, modern economies and advanced democracies are not exempt from the challenges of regionalized political distrust. In the United States, the findings of this research implies that the role of government in rural America is likely to remain a powerful political force in partisan electoral competition for rural voters. Beyond politics, efforts to address the policy concerns of rural American should focus on how to overcome rural distrust toward government. Geographic variation in government trust subsequently poses potential opportunities and hurdles for party leaders‚Äîand potential challenges for policymakers.","Do rural Americans trust the government less than non-rural Americans? In an era of declining trust in government and mounting geographic polarization, this research examines the relationship between geography, identity, and attitudes of political trust in the United States. Using national survey data from the 2016 and 2020 American National Election Studies time series surveys, this quantitative analysis tests hypotheses that rurality in the context of place and place-based identity is associated with lower trust in the federal government. Overall, the results show that both living in and identifying with more rural areas corresponds with decreased government trust, regardless of the political party of the incumbent president. These findings contribute to the understanding of America‚Äôs urban-rural political divide and suggest significant implications for both partisan leaders and policymakers.","4",0,"4","Political",4,0

Political Research Quarterly. https://doi.org/10.1177/10659129241289135","In 2014, the European Parliament experienced a ‚Äúpopulistearthquake‚Äù (McDonnell and Werner, 2020). Yet, no oneform of populism was identical to another. In Germany,The Left Party argued that the capitalist system is the rootof German problems. In France, the French Front Nationalfocused on immigration as the major cause of Frenchsuffering. A few years later, in the United States, DonaldTrump and the Republican Party argued that entrenchedelites were hurting normal Americans, as were immi-grants. Italy, India, the United Kingdom, and Brazil are afew more notable examples of countries who have ex-perienced a rise in populist leaders and sentiment since theturn of the century. In 2018, twenty executives around theworld were considered populist, a Ô¨Åve-fold increase from1990 (Kyle and Gultchin, 2018).One conclusion may be that, because populism is bredin each country‚Äôs unique sociopolitical environment,‚Äúpopulism‚Äù is merely a single term that refers to manydistinct concepts. Some focus on elite, government, andsystem-based causes, others on group-based causes.While this may be a useful way to differentiate populistleaders, it says little of the orientations that make pop-ulism attractive to people at the individual-level. Our goalin this paper was to determine who supports populist ideasand why in the United States. We Ô¨Ånd that, just as is thecase when it comes to support for populist elites, indi-viduals support the broader idea of populism for a host ofreasons. Some feel like victims of the political system,engage in conspiratorial thinking about nefarious elites,and are likely to support authoritarian leaders that canprovide relief from the existing, punishing status quo.Others do not feel like victims of the system, but of peoplewho are not like them in identity terms; they are high inwhite identity, Christian nationalism, and racial resent-ment. Others who support populism reject both the statusquo and lay blame on counter-identity forces. Thus, whilequestions about populism have centered on blame attri-bution (i.e., on orientations toward elites perceived asnon-responsive, or toward out-groups perceived to getmore than they deserve), we Ô¨Ånd that these are not mu-tually exclusive, even at the level of the individual.In addition to contributing to the understanding of whosupports populist ideas and why, we also believe ourresults provide avenues for future research on both theformation and effect of populist attitudes, particularlythose that are driven by social identity. Future studiesmight apply our constellations to additional substantivequestions. For example, are some classes of populismmore prone to top-down mobilization, do political elitescapitalize on existing classes of populism in a bottom-upmanner, or is there some synergistic, cyclic effect whereelite and mass populism rise in tandem for some classes but not others? Further, while we are careful to distinguishbetween normatively ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù variants ofpopulism, scholars and societal leaders might focus onhow to counter the non-democratic variants of populism,perhaps by employing or avoiding appeals to the varioussocial identities that we Ô¨Ånd predict populism.On its face, populism is not anti-democratic or in-herently dangerous. And, despite the rancor that populistleaders may generate, McDonnell and Werner (2020)indicate that many populist movements end more witha whimper than a bang. For some parties, populist rhetoricis a useful electoral strategy that is later tampered orabandoned once in power; some are coopted by other,more moderate groups (McDonnell and Werner, 2020).Yet, at the same time, the grievance-based, cultural formsof populism seem to be on the rise globally (Kyle andGultchin, 2018). If our analysis revealed that individual-level populist sentiment is more socioeconomic thancultural, and that there is an incongruence between eliteforms and mass forms of populism, we would possesslittle evidence that populism poses a threat in the UnitedStates. However, we Ô¨Ånd that all manner of grievances‚Äîprimarily racial and religious‚Äîhelp us determine who is apopulist. Inasmuch as some forms of populism posegreater threats to democratic norms and popular sover-eignty than others, we believe our results aid in differ-entiating the types of sentiments among the masses onwhich we should keep a close eye. Indeed, Piazza(Forthcoming) recently found that populism is con-nected with support for political violence in the UnitedStates.Our study is not without limitations. While we have, toour knowledge, examined the most comprehensive set ofindividual-level factors that may promote an attraction topopulist sentiments in the United States, there are surelyother factors that we have missed. Reasonable candidatesmight include more explicit operationalizations of statusthreat, sexism, and Ô¨Åner grained measures of socioeco-nomic deprivation, as well as purely psychological factorsthat oftentimes relate to ideology, such as system justi-Ô¨Åcation, need for cognitive closure, and narcissism.Populism may be more rooted in innate psychologicalorientations than previous work, including our own, as-sumes (though see Bakker, Rooduijn, and Schumacher,2016). We also encourage future work to examine andexpand our correlates in other sociopolitical contexts.Even though populism may manifest in very differentways across cultures from elites and systems, theindividual-level ingredients may be quite similar acrossparticular contexts (see Mudde and Rovire Kaltwasser,2018). Indeed, while we argue that the multiple-pathsperspective is generalizable to other contexts (seeHarteveld et al., 2022), as are some of the more abstractcategories of paths (e.g., economic grievances and identitycharacteristics), the speciÔ¨Åc paths are likely to differacross contexts. Additional comparative work in this veincould achieve the important task of deciphering whatunites populist attitudes across the world, just as existingwork has highlighted a number of dispositions that arestructurally similar but have different precise meaningsglobally (e.g., ideology).Moreover, we are unable to say that any one attitude/identity or collection of attitudes/identities causes pop-ulism. Our data are observational, and it is possible thatpopulist attitudes lead to, say, lower trust in government orhigher racial resentment. Perhaps there is reciprocalcausality, whereby populism and other attitudes mutuallyreinforce one another? We believe future scholarshipmight focus on identifying the causal ordering of populistattitudes. Finally, we reiterate an earlier discussion aboutour inability to decipher the potential pathways to pop-ulism among minority groups (e.g., racial, religious, andsexual orientation) due to insufÔ¨Åcient sample sizes. Eventhough we suspect many of the pathways we haveidentiÔ¨Åed traverse race and other group identities, it alsostands to reason that minority status itself produces aunique set of motivations for populist attitudes‚Äîfuturework should take this possibility seriously and take thesteps necessary to conduct subgroup analyses (e.g.,oversampling).","Recent years have witnessed a global uptick in populist candidates and sentiment. Populist communication and campaignstyles are well-studied, but whom in the U.S. mass public is attracted to populist ideas and why is still subject to debate.Using unique survey data, we employ latent proÔ¨Åle analysis to estimate constellations of characteristics and orientationsthat relate to support for populist ideas in the United States. Instead of a single, linear path, there are several routes topopulist support composed of many combinations of social, psychological, and political characteristics. Whereas someturn to populism because they feel like victims of the political system, others do so to create exclusive sovereignty fortheir preferred identity group(s). We also Ô¨Ånd that populist support is more connected to psychological and politicalorientations than socioeconomic circumstances or even political predispositions, such as partisanship. While populism,itself, is not anti-democratic, some forms of populist support appear to be exclusionary on the grounds of race, religion,and political identity.","1",0,"1","Political",4,0
258,72,"Mason, K. A., Vlasceanu, M., & Jost, J. T. (2024). Effects of system-sanctioned framing on climate awareness and environmental action in the United States and beyond. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 121(38). https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2405973121","Climate inaction is attributable, in part, to climate skepticism and resistance to proenvironmental policies, especially on the political right (4, 13, 16, 17). Aggregating across respondents from 63 countries, we observed a strong negative association between right-wing conservatism, on the one hand, and belief in climate change and support for proenvironmental policies, on the other. These results support the notion that a global expansion of left‚Äìright climate polarization is underway (5, 16, 18, 41, 42).

Ideological differences in climate skepticism and resistance to action may be explained, in part, by stronger system justification motives, that is, preferences for maintaining the societal status quo, among conservative-rightists compared to liberal-leftists (7). Moreover, acknowledging the problem of anthropogenic climate change implicates the entire economic system of industrial capitalism and threatens conservative values such as support for the free market and opposition to governmental regulation (7‚Äì9, 43, 44). Although system justification motivation often leads people to downplay social problems and resist efforts to address them, previous studies hinted that the system justification motivation can also be harnessed in the service of social change (8, 45, 46).

The present research program represents the most ambitious and comprehensive attempt thus far to apply the technique of system-sanctioned framing as a way of overcoming resistance to social change in 63 countries. In support of hypotheses derived from system justification theory, we observed both in the United States and the aggregated sample that participants who were exposed to the system-sanctioned message frame expressed more belief in climate change, more support for proenvironmental policies, and stronger intentions to share climate information on social media compared to participants assigned to the control condition. Importantly, the intervention was effective for liberal-leftists as well as conservative-rightists in the United States. This suggests that patriotic, system-supporting language appealed to conservative-rightists, as expected, without triggering reactance among liberal-leftists (8).

In country-specific analyses across 17 samples, we observed that results varied by region and ideology. The intervention was generally quite effective for liberal-leftists and conservative-rightists in the United States and Brazil. Because both countries are highly polarized along left‚Äìright lines, the fact that the system-justifying appeal was well received across the ideological spectrum was especially encouraging. We also observed that the intervention was at least partially effective among liberal-leftists in France and Chile and among conservative-rightists in Israel and the Netherlands. However, it appeared to backfire for conservative-rightists in Germany, Belgium, and Russia.

Although any attempt to explain country-specific patterns is somewhat speculative, we raise a few possibilities here. It may be pertinent that in France‚Äîunlike all other European countries examined thus far‚Äîliberal-leftists tend to score higher than conservative-rightists on general system justification (47). This could explain why the system-sanctioned framing manipulation was more impactful for leftists than rightists in the French context.

It is also conceivable that people are more receptive to system-justifying messages when their preferred political party is in power. For example, liberal-leftists might be more open to system-sanctioned framing when the government is left-leaning (vs. right-leaning), and vice versa for conservative-rightists. Since 2021, the government of Chile has been led by a left-wing coalition (‚ÄúApprove Dignity‚Äù); this could explain why leftists were more responsive to system-justifying messages in the Chilean context. By contrast, the governments in Israel and the Netherlands have been led by rightists since 2009 and 2021, respectively. These facts could help to explain why rightists would be responsive to the call to maintain the status quo in each of these countries. However, these interpretations should be treated cautiously, because our formal analysis of the role of the party-in-power failed to produce consistent conclusions that applied to all 17 countries under investigation (SI Appendix, Tables S28‚ÄìS30).

The situation in Germany is somewhat more complicated. For one thing, leftists in Germany are suspicious of patriotic language because of its association with the Holocaust; this may help to explain why the system-sanctioned frame was ineffective for them (47). It may also be pertinent that the German government was led from 2005 to 2021 by a center-right Chancellor, Angela Merkel, who expressed real concern about the problem of climate change. According to a public opinion survey conducted in 2021 by the European Investment Bank, 77% of Germans believe that climate change is the most serious problem facing humanity. However, far-rightists are much less likely than other respondents to agree with this assessment, with one-third denying that climate change is attributable to human activity. Whereas 69% of leftists in Germany are highly supportive of renewable energy initiatives, only 42% of rightists are supportive (48). Climate skepticism is also highly pronounced among far-right supporters of the Vlaams Belang Party in Belgium (49). Thus, baseline ideological differences could help to explain why our manipulation appeared to trigger backlash among rightists (but not leftists) in Germany and Belgium.

According to a recent analysis of public opinion, climate attitudes are not clearly polarized along left‚Äìright ideological lines in Russia (50). However, concern about climate change is generally lower in Russia than in other European countries, and climate skepticism appears to be driven, at least in part, by investment in the fossil fuel industry and the desire to preserve Russia‚Äôs status as a ‚ÄúGreat Power‚Äù under Vladimir Putin (51), who has increasingly appealed to the authoritarian right (52). Thus, the current political situation in Russia may help to explain why the system-sanctioned intervention backfired among rightists. Future research based on nationally representative samples is needed to assess the validity of all of the above interpretations.

In any case, there are probably several reasons why the experimental intervention was more effective in the United States than in other countries. First, the system dependence and system-sanctioned change manipulations were originally developed and applied to environmental attitudes in the American context (8, 39). Second, we observed that U.S. participants were more skeptical about climate change and resistant to proenvironmental initiatives than participants from other countries. These differences mirror the results of public opinion surveys based on nationally representative samples (4, 16, 53). Thus, it is possible that, compared to other countries, U.S. participants had more room to improve in terms of climate awareness and action.

We obtained the largest treatment effect sizes for the system-sanctioned change manipulation in the United States (with d‚Äôs ranging from 0.25 to 0.37), where the original manipulation was developed (8). According to current statistical conventions, these effects would be classified as ‚Äúsmall‚Äù to ‚Äúmedium‚Äù in size (58). In other countries, the effect sizes tended to be smaller than in the United States. However, it is important to bear in mind that small effects are not psychologically insignificant, because they often exert highly meaningful cumulative effects over time (58).

Despite the overall success of the system-sanctioned frame intervention, there are several limitations that future work should address. For one thing, the control condition did not mention climate change, so it is possible that simply emphasizing the problem would affect climate awareness and action. However, a global megastudy comparing the effects of 11 different interventions, all of which referred explicitly to climate change, shows that this is not the case.

Concluding Remarks
This research program has implications for messaging strategies aiming at improving climate awareness and action. From the perspective of system justification theory, it is crucial to avoid triggering epistemic and existential threats, insofar as these can motivate system-defensiveness and backlash against proenvironmental initiatives (7). A better strategy, according to our research, would be to emphasize how acknowledging and addressing climate change serves patriotic, system-preserving functions, allowing people to celebrate and perpetuate‚Äîrather than relinquish and replace‚Äîfamiliar ways of life and cherished cultural traditions.","Despite growing scientific alarm about anthropogenic climate change, the world is not on track to solve the crisis. Inaction may be partially explained by skepticism about climate change and resistance to proenvironmental policies from people who are motivated to maintain the status quo (i.e., conservative-rightists). Therefore, practical interventions are needed. In the present research program, we tested an experimental manipulation derived from system justification theory in which proenvironmental initiatives were framed as patriotic and necessary to maintain the American ‚Äúway of life.‚Äù In a large, nationally representative U.S. sample, we found that the system-sanctioned change intervention successfully increased liberal-leftists‚Äô as well as conservative-rightists‚Äô belief in climate change; support for proenvironmental policies; and willingness to share climate information on social media. Similar messages were effective in an aggregated analysis involving 63 countries, although the overall effect sizes were small. More granular exploratory analyses at the country level revealed that while the intervention was moderately successful in some countries (e.g., Brazil, France, Israel), it backfired in others (Germany, Belgium, Russia). Across the three outcome variables, the effects of the intervention were consistent and pronounced in the United States, in support of the hypothesis that system justification motivation can be harnessed on behalf of social change. Potential explanations for divergent country-level effects are discussed. The system-sanctioned change intervention holds considerable promise for policymakers and communicators seeking to increase climate awareness and action.","6",1,"2","Political",2,1
