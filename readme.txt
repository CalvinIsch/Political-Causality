This project contains all data and reproduction scripts for the article: “Political Slant and Causal Overreach in the Behavioral Sciences”. Here we briefly describe each file included in this directory:-Analysis.Rmd – contrains the R code for producing all results in the ms.-Analysis.html – a knitted version of the R code, in HTML format.-figures – a folder with the figures produced in R and Latex.#### Data Files ####-political_ratings.csv – contains all labels for the four classifiers for all articles in our dataset.-Causal-Validation.csv – contains a sample of 200 articles used as the held out validation set for the causal claim classifier.-Cross-Sectional-Validation.csv - contains a sample of 200 articles used as the held out validation set for the study methodology classifier.-Political_Validation.csv – contains a sample of 256 articles that were nominated by the politics in Science Consortium and reviewed by a panel of 6 scholars, to develop the political relevance and slant classifier.-Political_Validation_Cross-Sect.csv – contains a stratified random sample of 120 cross sectional articles that were independently evaluated to assess if our political slant classifier transported to the new dataset.-citation.csv – contains citation information for all articles in the dataset.-random_slopes.csv – is produced throughout the analysis to create a table in the SI.#### Setting up your R environment ####This project uses **renv** to pin package versions. We don’t ship a `.Rprofile`, so you’ll load the project library manually each session.-renv.lock is necessary for this reproduction-renv – a directory with additional information R needs to get the appropriate packages and versions.
